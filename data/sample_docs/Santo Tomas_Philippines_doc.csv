== History ==
The then-municipality of Santo Tomas was founded in 1666, with Captain Manuel Melo as its first head. Originally, it was composed of a large Poblacion. When the Spanish friars arrived, their first and foremost objective was to construct a church near the river to satisfy their propensity for water. Thus, the present site of the Roman Catholic Church was chosen, near the San Juan River. As years went by, more houses were built around the church. This became the center of the Poblacion.
Other groups of houses were scattered all over the area. They were given such odd names as "Kabaong", because the stones along the road were coffin shaped; "Putol" because the trail was cut by a creek that crossed over it, "Aptayin", because "apta" of fine shrimps were found in the brook, "Biga", because biga trees abounded there, and "Camballao", because twin rivers divided the place. These different unit groups comprised the barrios of the town.
The natives were by nature God-fearing, peaceful and obedient. The conquerors did not much have difficulty in enforcing decrees and orders. One such irrevocable decree was to change the original names of the barrios to the names of Saints in the Catholic Calendar and to place each them under its patrotonio, the former "Pook" and "Aptayin" were joined together and called San Bartolome, "Kabaong" was changed to San Vicente, "Biga" to Santa Anastacia, and "Camballao" to San Isidro Sur and Isidro Norte. The whole town was given the name of Santo Tomas de Aquino, a high Prince of the Dominican Order to where most of the first friars belonged. As time went by, more barrios were added to the list each with an assumed name of a saint.
From the year 1666, the head of the town had different titles. He was variously known as "Captain" from 1666 to 1782; "Alcalde" from 1783 to 1788; "Gobernadorcillo" from 1789 to 1821; "Presidente Local" from 1822 to 1899; "Presidente Municipal" from 1900 to 1930; and "Municipal Mayor" from 1931 to the present.
