It is Nįįňą in the Hoocąk language.The government initially designated this area in 1835 as an industrial and agricultural mission to the Menominee Indians of the area. Early settlement by European Americans began a few years later, stimulated in large part by the proximity of the area to the Fox River.Kimberly-Clark corporation was formed here in 1872. It founded a major paper mill here in 1873, as the region had become a center of lumbering. Profits from lumber stimulated the development of businesses and a variety of professions.
