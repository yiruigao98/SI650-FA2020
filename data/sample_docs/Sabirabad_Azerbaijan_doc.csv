== General history ==
According to Gulistan Peace Treaty of October 12, 1813, part of the khanates of Azerbaijan was occupied by the Russians. Mughan territory was also captured by Russia. As a result of the administrative territorial reforms carried out in Russia, a new territory - Javad Uyezd was set up in Baku in 1868. After the merger of Russia with Russia, a large group of Ukrainian peasants was transferred to Javad, and the settlement was named Petropavlovka since 1888. Petropavlovka was part of the Javad area (gaza) of the Baku province. In 1901 there were only 87 farms in that area, and in 1907 the number of Russian villages in those areas was 13. In 1913, there was a cotton-cleaning plant, two industrial enterprises-mills were put into operation. On May 1, 1920, Petropavlovsk became the local state power body of the Revolutionary Committee of the Djevatskoye Uyezd, after Azerbaijan joined Russia again. From May 1, 1921 to April 8, 1929, Sabirabad region operated as the Petropavlovsk district of Djevatskoye Uyezd . On April 8, 1929, by the decision of the VI All-Azerbaijani Soviet Congress, it was called the Petropavlovsk district of Mugan district. On August 8, 1930, according to the Central Executive Committee's decision # 476, the district system was abolished and Petropavlovsk became an independent region. Almost a year later, on October 7, 1931, by the Decree of the Central Executive Committee of Azerbaijan, Petropavlovsk was given the name of Mirza Alakbar Sabir, the great poet of Azerbaijan, the founder of the public satire in our classical literature.


== Creation of Sabirabad city ==


=== Javad city ===
Ancient Javad was one of the main points on the trade route between Europe and the East. A number of European and Russian travelers and diplomats traveled to Javad, including British Anthony Jenkinson (October 6, 1561), Russians Artemy Sukhanov (1551-1552) and Fyodor Kotov (August 1623), German Adam Olearius (March 31, 1637), Dutchman Jan Jansen Struys (1671-1672), Scottish John Bell, (7 December 1716), and went to Iran, crossing over a bridge over the ships bound by chains.
Some of them wrote here that the town was reminiscent of the city, they have seen many brilliant artisans who produced bricks, cane houses, mud-watered houses, gardens, carpets and various silk fabrics, and even saw weavers. Anthony Jenkinson's remarks, which were in Javad in the Safavid rule, are very interesting.
He writes in his October 6, 1562, that "The king's yard has a beautiful palace filled with all kinds of fruits." On his return from Iran in 1563, in Javad on April 6, he met with Abdulla Khan Ustajli, the Shirvan governor in his palace. She also receives a certificate from a gentleman, which permits free trade.
In his memoirs A.Jenkinson, reported that the mausoleum was written in his palace in Javad, and was confirmed by the seal of the 12th year of his reign and called himself the "king of Shirvan and Girgan". Javad was a large settlement in the 17th-18th centuries. Travelers Evliya Çelebi, İ.Lerx, I.Garberq, along with other Shirvan's sights, also saw Javad's  "fabric and manufactures" combined with great feudal weavers who produced silk fabrics, carpets and other things, and wrote their own thoughts.
Javad has been an important point in the midst of the 19th centuries, on the sea and the dry trade routes used by the Europeans. Another line of the line called Astrakhan-Rasht road was "Shamakhi-Javad" and "Javad-Lankaran". The Javad's road also became very popular among the people.
Graf Valerian Zubov was camped near Javad on November 21, 1795 when he came to Azerbaijan with the tsarist forces. In this area where the two rivers met, they wanted to set up a city named Yekaterinoserd, to deploy two thousand soldiers there, to marry them with Armenian and Georgian daughters, to provide them with land and agricultural tools. 
The ships coming from Astrakhan had to vacate their cargo here. They wanted to use this city as a contact point in Georgia, Ganja, Baku, Salyan, Shamakhi and trade with Iran.
On March 8, 1736, Nadir Shah was convened here in the place called "Sugovushan", in Galagain, with 100,000 attendees and 20,000 delegates from them. Along with the convention, the agreement, which was discussed with the Ottoman ambassador, was approved at the congress. 
The name of Javad was given to a major uyezd. It has been a crucial point for a long time on the Kura ship. From the middle of the 19th century the "Baku-Salyan" and "Salyan-Astara" postings were opened. Meanwhile, Javad began to lose its previous significance slowly. But it remained a fishing point for a long time.


=== Sabirabad ===
The history of Sabirabad city begins  since 1868. There was a traditional weekly market (Thursday) in the area between the ancient Sugovushan and Galagain villages on Kur and Araz. The first two-storey building and orthodox church is built from the bricks to create a long-awaited city of Javad this year.

But later, the idea of rebuilding the city was abandoned.
In 1887, when Ukrainian villagers were transferred to Mughan, 26 families were settled in this settlement and the village was called Petropavlovsk. There were 87 farms here in 1901.
At the end of the 19th century, the village of Petropavlovka was built in the territory of the present city. In 1887, the Ukrainians began to move here.

The village began to develop in the early 20th century. On August 8, 1930 Petropavlovsk became the center of the district. On October 2, 1931 Sabirabad was renamed. In 1952, the settlement took its status as a city on December 4, 1959.

After the second half of the XIX century, Tsar Russia sent noble two brothers, Peter and Paul to give them instructions to cultivate cotton here.
They lay the basis of a shipyard and shipyard in the present-day Sabirabad city, at the intersection of the cotton plant and the current Heydar Hamidov street and Vidadi street, behind the secondary school named after S.Vurgun on near the junction of Kura Araz, near Javad, Galagain and Kurkandi villages. At that time, the river Araz was in the vicinity of the Kura River. When Pyotr and Pavel produced cotton at the factory, they were going to take the Kura river to the Caspian Sea and then to the Volga River and Russian cities through the ships.
Cotton should be harvested in nearby villages. In this way, by giving cotton seeds and other means to nearby villages, they were encouraged to plant cotton and to sign a contract for the purchase of the product.

Many professionals and other workers from Russia are brought here with their families to work at the plant and shipyard. Homes, including hospitals, clubs, and other public buildings are also being built in the area of the plant and port for their survival. Thus, in the territory of present Sabirabad one Russian village is formed. Despite the distortion of the facts, the logic of the Russian empire's policy is so appropriate. After the Turkmenchay treaty of 1828, the Russian Empire completed its occupation policy in the South Caucasus. The southern borders of the empire were known after agreeing with the Iranian kingdom.However, because of the lack of confidence in the protection of these borders, it was entrusted to the people who were deported from Russia and Ukraine. From the Nakhchivan to Astara, Russian villages were built along the entire border. In the territory of Sabirabad, Krasnoselsk (Kara Nuru), Pokrovka (Garatapa), Novodon (Navadan), Aleksandrovka (Shahriyar), Vladimirovka (Nizamikend), Khersonovka (Nasimikend) and other villages were built. The present Sabir canal was also drawn to the Araz River in order to grow crops and meet other water requirements in these villages. Newly populated Russian villages were also located around this canal. In order to undermine the idea of the local community, it was alleged that those who were moved here were expelled from their homeland. In fact, the climate of this place was favorable for their homeland to live.
In Siberia, Tyga, and other places in Russia for the exile, it is inexhaustible. It was part of the osvivatization (to own) policy.
The local population began to move here from neighboring villages and districts. After the earthquake in Shamakhi in the early twentieth century, a flow of Shamakhi  people began and they constructed "Shamakhililar" neighborhood, cemetery and mosque here.

After the revolutionary movements in Iran were deposited, the Iranians immigrated here and settled here in the "hamshary" neighborhood.From western Azerbaijan, those who were deported by Stalin's orders were brought here.Meskhetian Turks also sheltered here.Thus, the population of Sabirabad was formed.
After the Tsar empire was replaced by the Soviet Empire, Lenin's attitude towards Azerbaijan was different from that of the previous Tsar. It is said that, after Lenin's coming to power, he did not recognize all the Tsar's treaties apart from the Turkmenchay Treaty. Even Stalin remained loyal to this treaty, and in 1945 Soviet troops were in Tehran, but did not merge Iranian Azerbaijan into the USSR. However, the purpose of the USSR was to capture the lands of neighboring countries in the name of spreading socialism worldwide. South Belarus, Western Ukraine, Bessarabia, Pribaltika were united into the USSR but Iranian Azerbaijan was not merged.
There was also a need for a factory to transform the raw cotton. The Tsar government entrusts this work to the Vagen brothers. They, in turn, invite experts from Germany to build a plant and put into operation in 1906.

Each year, the Kura and Araz rivers flooded the city, causing great damage to the surrounding villages. Thus, the USSR government made a decision to establish a brigade of only two units in the country. Then, as the technique increased, auto stations and tractor repair stations were also created. There were Russian neighborhoods around these offices. These neighborhoods, the surrounding area of the bus station, were called osvoenni.
