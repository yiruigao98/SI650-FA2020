== Transport ==
Hoppers Crossing is served by the Hoppers Crossing railway station, located to the south of the suburb, on the Werribee line. When opened in 1970, it was a small station on the western side of the Old Geelong Road level crossing on the Geelong line, served by only a few diesel-hauled trains each day. In 1983, the station was relocated to the eastern side of the level crossing, in conjunction with electrification of the line to Werribee. It was not until the mid-1990s that Hoppers Crossing started to receive train services comparable with the rest of suburban Melbourne.

In the mid-2000s a tramway was proposed for the Hoppers Crossing - Werribee area to replace bus services, but the idea was not seen as feasible by the Wyndham City Council and Victorian State Government.Bus services in Hoppers Crossing have typically connected areas close to the station with the station, Werribee Plaza, and Werribee. As Hoppers' satellite suburbs Tarneit and Truganina grow, bus services have also been extended. Hoppers is served by various buses.
Other major roads include the Princes Highway (C109), Heaths Road (C701), Derrimut Road (C702), Hogans Road, Morris Road, Tarneit Road and Sayers Road.A new railway line opened in 2015, the Regional Rail Link, travels from West Werribee through Tarneit to Deer Park and includes a new railway station at Tarneit. The new station, built near the north east corner of Derrimut and Leakes Roads, provides a much faster service than the current Werribee railway line, which must pass through Altona and Footscray. It has car parking with 1,000 spaces, ensuring Tarneit becomes a prime regional area for those who commute to the city on a regular basis. Regional Rail Link also connects the Melton and Werribee railway lines and re-direct Geelong V/Line trains from the Werribee Line.
