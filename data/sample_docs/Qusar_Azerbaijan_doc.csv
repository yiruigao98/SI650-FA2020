Qusar (also Kusary; Azerbaijani: Qusar, Lezgian: Кцlар) is the capital of Qusar Rayon, Azerbaijan. Qusar is located in foothills of Greater Caucasus, over the Qusarchay River, 35 kilometers southwest from Khudat railway station and 180 km from Baku.


== Etymology ==
There are many accounts of the origin of the city, but the most likely is a version by Tamilla Khalilova. Since the 7th century, conquest of the South Caucasus by Arabs began. According to historical data the Arabs reached a territory of present Qusar Rayon. According to the historians version name of the river is originated from Arabian Al-Qausar. In translation from the Quran into English “Al Qausar – in translation means a river of abundance, that is a heaven river, water of which is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its fragrance is nicer than musk and birds with beautiful long necks like necks of camels fly around it.” The settlement got its name from the river – Qusar. Modern historians believe that the name Qusar derives from khisar.
