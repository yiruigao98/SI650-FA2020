Alandi is a town and a municipal council in the Pune district in the state of Maharashtra, India. The town is popular as a place of pilgrimage and the resting place of the 13th century Marathi saint Dnyaneshwar. 


== History ==

Alandi has a long history but gained prominence in the 13th century when Dnyaneshwar (1275–1296) decided to entomb, otherwise known as sanjeevan samadhi, himself in a samadhi, a form of shrine, under the then existing Siddheshwar temple complex in 1296.
A temple was built over the Samadhi by Ambekar Deshpande in around 1580–1600. Further additions to the temple were made during the Maratha Empire era by Maratha nobles and the Peshwa. In 1778, Alandi was granted to Mahadji Shinde, the powerful  Maratha statesman of the Maratha confederacy at that time, by the Peshwa.For two decades after that, the Shinde  family were the main sponsors of various renovations of the temple.In the 1820s, Haibatraobuva Arphalkar, a courtier of the Scindia of Gwalior, started the modern Palkhi tradition of carrying the paduka (sandals) of Dnyaneshwar to Pandharpur during the annual Wari. Haibatraobuva was laid to rest under the first step of the temple complex per his will.Despite being a small town, it was granted municipal status during the early British Raj. The council would raise revenue through levying tax on pilgrims which used to number around 50,000 at the end of 19th century.

== Pilgrimage center ==


=== Dnyaneshwar samadhi ===

Alandi is a well known place of pilgrimage for Hindu Marathi people because of the town's association with Dnyaneshwar. His devotees believe that he is still alive.  A temple complex was built at Dnyaneshwar's samadhi and is visited by pilgrims, especially those of the Varkari sect. The Ekadashi of the dark half of each month attracts 60-70 thousand pilgrims to the town.


=== Pandharpur vari ===

Every year, the Paduka (symbolic sandals) of Dnyaneshwar go on a 21-day Palkhi from Alandi to reach Pandharpur on Ashadhi Ekadashi (June or July in the Gregorian calendar). The Palkhi procession is joined by thousands of Varkari devotees for the 150 km journey.


=== Kartik Festival ===
The biggest festival in Alandi is held every year on Kartika Vadya Ekadashi (the eleventh day of the dark fortnight of the Hindu month of Kartik in the Shalivana Shaka calendar). The festival falls close to the day Dnyaneshwar entered Samadhi. This festival or yatra is attended by pilgrims and has a significant economic impact for the local population.

Bathing in the Indrayani River has special significance for pilgrims to Alandi. However, the river is heavily polluted because of sewage discharge by towns along its course and contains high amount of Fecal coliform.Being a pilgrim center, the stretch of Indrayani River at Alandi, by tradition, has been designated a sanctuary and no fishing takes place.

== Economy ==


=== Pilgrim services ===
The economy of  Alandi was historically based around its status as a place of pilgrimage. Although the major festivals in the town are held only twice a year, pilgrims from all over Maharashtra visit the place throughout the year. The needs of the pilgrims are catered for by groups of Brahmins who officiate at the samadhi, weddings, or religious services to the bereaved. Vendors outside the main temple complex offer goods, such as garlands and turmeric, for worshipping at the samadhi along with religious souvenirs and books. Marathi Hindu castes such as the Padmashali have built Dharmashalas (Pilgrim rest houses) that offer accommodation to pilgrims from their castes. The temple's two main festivals occur in Shaka month of Jyeshtha (late June - early July), when the Dnyaneshwar's palkhi departs for the Pandharpur Wari, and in the second half of the Shaka month of Kartik (November). During these festivals, a significant percentage of local population earns income by offering accommodation, catering and other services to the pilgrims.  However, a significant number residents also have negative feelings about these festivals. The local Municipal council also collects pilgrim or goods tax for public health provision.  A report for Pune metropolitan area in 1991 stated that because of religious nature of the place, industry will not be allowed in Alandi.
