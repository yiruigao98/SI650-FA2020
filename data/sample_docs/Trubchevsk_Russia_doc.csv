== History ==
An old Severian town, Trubchevsk was first mentioned as Trubetsk in East Slavic manuscripts describing the events of 1164 and 1183, although the locally 975 is regarded as the year of its foundation. At that early period, it was variously called Trubech (Трубечь), Trubetsk (Трубецк), Trubchesk (Трубческ), or Trubezhsk (Трубежск).The town is referred to in the great Old Russian poem, The Tale of Igor's Campaign. This poem calls for the princes of the various Slavic lands to join forces in resisting the invasions of the nomadic Cuman people. The poem also glorified the courage of the army of Vsevolod Svyatoslavich, the ruler of Kursk and Trubchevsk.

Originally a minor center of Severia, Trubchevsk had its own princes sporadically throughout the Middle Ages, in 1164–1196, 1202–1211, 1212–1240, 1378–1399, and finally in 1462–1503. The last dynasty eventually settled in Moscow, where they became known as Princes Trubetskoy. Between 1609 and 1644, the town belonged to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its name was spelled as Trubczewsk.
During World War II, Trubchevsk was occupied by the German Army from October 9, 1941 to September 18, 1943.
Prior to the war, about 137 Jews lived in Trubchevsk. Most of the Jews were craftsmen, including cobblers and carpenters. The town was occupied by German forces in early October 1941. By that time, more than half of the Jews fled or evacuated. The Jews from the Trubchevsk district were gathered in a Klub for 3 days and shot afterwards at the edge of the village. Their bodies were burnt. In total, according to the Soviet archives, 751 Soviet citizens perished due to bad treatment or as a result of shooting in the entire Trubchevsk district. Aside from Jews, mentally ill children and adults were exterminated as well.
