Riverton (Arapaho: Hooxono'o) is a city in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States.  The city's population was 10,615 at the 2010 census, making it the largest city in the county overall.


== History ==
The city is an incorporated entity of the state of Wyoming. The community was named Riverton because of the four rivers that meet there. The town was built on land ceded from the Wind River Indian Reservation in 1906, a situation that often makes it subject to jurisdictional claims by the nearby Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes.
A legal ruling on November 7, 2017, by the 10th Circuit Court, ruled again in the EPA reservation boundary dispute.  Though the decision was complex, the 10th Circuit Court answered plainly.  Riverton is not on the reservation.  The 10th Circuit's decision is now official and final after the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals 2017 ruling.  The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the EPA, and held that the land had been ceded in 1905 by an Act of Congress.  This ruling ends the dispute, bringing the debate and controversy to an end. On August 21, 2017 a Total Solar Eclipse went over Riverton.
