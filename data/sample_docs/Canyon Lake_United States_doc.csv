== History ==
In 1882 the California Southern Railroad built a line from Perris to Elsinore along the east side of the San Jacinto River. The Santa Fe Railroad bought the line and joined it with their line in San Bernardino. Floods in 1884, 1916, and 1927 washed out the tracks, and the Santa Fe Railroad decided to abandon the line. Soon after the last flood the Temescal Water Company bought the railroad right-of-way, as well as 1,000 acres (400 ha) from Henry Evans, a rancher, and other land from B.T. Kuert. Those were the two parcels that make up most of Canyon Lake today.Construction started in 1927 to build a dam across the river to store water. It was finished in 1929. Railroad Canyon Reservoir, when built, was one of the largest fresh water lakes for fishing, hunting and camping in Southern California. The reservoir and the surrounding area was leased as a concession from Temescal Water Company as a recreational area under the operation of the George D. Evans family from 1937 until after World War II. After the war Ray and Alpha Schekel, along with John and Darleen Kirkland, operated the resort until 1949 when the lake was drained for repairs to the floodgates. Elinor and Donald Martin operated the resort from its reopening in 1953 until 1968.In 1968 the Corona Land Development Company developed the new community.Canyon Lake began as a master-planned community developed by Corona Land Company in 1968, consisting of 4,801 lots. All but a few roads within the city are privately held and maintained by the Canyon Lake Property Owners Association. The 3 entrances to the Canyon Lake POA areas are gated and guarded, accessible by residents and authorized guests.

=== Security ===
All gates are manned twenty-four hours a day by a community patrol contracted by US Security Associates. Access is granted to outsiders by sponsorship from a property owner or renter who calls in their guests to a 24-hour answer line. Since becoming an incorporated city in 1990, Canyon Lake has its own police department (through a contract with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, out of the Lake Elsinore Station), as well as the private security services. In recent years specialized "code enforcement" officers have also maintained patrols of the approximately 20-acre (8.1 ha) parcel of land administered by the Bureau of Land Management which encompasses the eastern shore of the lake in its upper reaches. The trail running north along the eastern shore of the lake has become an inviting activity for hikers and birdwatchers, particularly in the winter months when the hills are green and temperatures lower. Canyon Lake forbids all public use of any "two-wheeled motorized vehicle" (that is, all motorcycles, mopeds, and dirt bikes) on all private streets throughout the CLPOA, but excluding the two public roads (Railroad Canyon and Goetz Roads).The Canyon Lake Property Owners Association contracts with US Security Associates for community patrol. The patrol enforces community rules and regulations (CC&Rs) which includes noise ordinances, speed limits, and community access. The Marine Patrol division enforces lake, parks, beach & fishing rules and regulations. All California fishing laws are enforced.

== In popular culture ==
In 2006, the community was the subject of United Gates of America, a BBC television documentary directed by Alex Cooke, featuring journalist Charlie LeDuff. He lived for a month within the community, to explore why people wanted to lock themselves behind gates and fences, and what effect it had on the residents.

The film was the subject of some controversy within the community, but received positive reviews in the UK and other parts of the US.
