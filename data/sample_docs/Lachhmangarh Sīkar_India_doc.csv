The nearing area of the Laxmangarh town are also very rich in heritage. The PEER Baba ki Samadhi located in the revenue village of Alkhpura Bogan near Hapas is also a 300-year-old monument. The monument is a place of worship for both the Hindus and Muslims of the area. The great fair is organised every year on the sixth of Bhadarpad (Hindi Month). Large number of people participate in the fair.
The area is arid ridden and the main source of their income is agriculture. The agriculture is based on the monsoon rains. The average rainfall in the area is also very less. Certain farmers are now constructing tubewells in the area for irrigation purposes. The aerial view of the surrounding area is magnificent that can be enjoyed from the roof top of the Samadhi Building, the eastern side is more splendid. The greenery view of Choudhary ParsaRam Dhaka's Farm House located at 400 metres is eye catching.
The large workforce is also migrated to Gulf countries as labour and earning their livelihood. Certain people of the area are also engaged in the Hawala business. The Hawala operators and the money pumped in by these gulf earners through these operators, impair the fair assessment of the income of the people.

== Water ==
Groundwater is the only drinkable water in the region; even when the level of the water table dips very low the people still find ways to obtain it. The TDS level of the local groundwater is 1000 PPM to 3500 PPM, which is quite high; consequently, most educated people use some sort of water purification method, for example reverse osmosis or ultraviolet.


== Laxmangarh Fort ==

The most imposing building in this town is its small fortress (owned by the Jhunjhunwala family) which looms over the well laid out township on its west side. Laxman Singh, the Raja of Sikar, built the fort in the early 19th century after Kan Singh Saledhi besieged the prosperous town. The fort of Laxmangarh is one of the most unique pieces of fort architecture in the world, because the structure is built on top of scattered pieces of huge rocks.
The Laxmangarh Fort is private property - owned by a local businessman and is closed to the public. You can, however, climb the ramp to a temple which is open to the public, and the view from the ramp can be quite fascinating too. Of course, seeing the town from this height tempts you to go further higher, but a guard effectively keeps the public out.
This fort is also connected to another fascinating heritage site of the town ‘Char Chowk Ki Haveli’ or commonly known as Ganeriwal Haveli. It is nominated un Indian Heritage site. This haveli is also built alongside Laxmanghar fort and was given to Ganeriwal's to maintain town administration and main bazar. It is also a common belief that most popular Birla family were munim's (taxman) to Ganeriwal's 200 years ago. Also a frequent visit site for Shivaji. Newer generation of Ganeriwals still reside at this haveli and Mr. Girdhari Ganeriwal is the heads the property of approximately 300 rooms.
