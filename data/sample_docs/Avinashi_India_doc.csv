== History ==
Avinashi is part of the ancient Kongunadu region, which now comprises the districts of Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Salem, Dharmapuri, Karur, Namakkal, Dindigul and Krishnagiri. This place was known as Thirupukkoliyur in the Sangam era. It is one of the seven Shivastalams in Kongu Nadu; however this temple is better known as Karunaiyaaththaal temple. Avinashi is also referred to in inscriptions as Dakshina Varanasi, Tiruppukkozhiyur etc. Tirumular's Tirumantiram, Arunagirinathar's Tiruppugazh & Manikkavasakar's Tiruvasakam refer to this shrine. This temple is regarded as the first of the seven Tevara Stalams in the Kongu Region of Tamil Nadu."Vinasam" in Tamil means "Destruction".  Prefixing with 'A' means 'No-destruction'.  Avinashi is "a place which doesn't have any destruction by any means".  In all Shiva temples, Goddess Shakthi(Parvathi) is seen left-side of Lord Shiva.  Whereas in Avinashi, she is right-side of Lord Shiva. Inscriptions here reveal that the Cholas, Pandyas and the Hoysalas have made extensive endowments to the temples. Sundaramoorthy Nayanar on his way to meet Cheramaan Peruman, the Nayanar happened to visit Avinashi. As he was passing through one of the streets, he heard two discordant notes coming from opposite houses, one echoing joy and another sorrow. The puzzled saint understood the cause for the strange phenomenon.
Two boys of the same age went to bathe in a tank from which emerged a crocodile and devoured one of them. There was being celebrated the "Upanayanam" (Thread ceremony) of the surviving boy, now 8 years old. Hence there was joy and mirth in the house. While the other people were unable to bear their sorrow.
Had their boy been alive, they too would be celebrating his "Upanayanam". Intensely moved by this, Sundaramoorthy Nayanar poured out of soulful song, praying to Lord shiva to resurrect the dead child. His prayer was answered. The empty tank started surging with water from which emerged the crocodile and ejected the child as a fully grown boy of eight years.
Avinashi also has Karivaradharaja Perumal temple, Anjaneya Temple (by Vysarayar), Akasa Raayan temple, Angalamman Temple, and Ayyappan Temple.

== Festivals ==
This temple's car is the second biggest in India, after the one in Tiruvarur  and is noted for its fine wooden carvings. Since the old car was destroyed by fire in 90's, it has been rebuilt. The annual Bhrammotsavam is celebrated in the month of Chittirai. Apart from Temple car festival,  'Arubathi moovar (63 Naayanmaars) Ula' is one of the notable festival in this temple. The festival chariot here is said to be on par with Tiruvarur. Previously it was a 10-day festival, but now it is celebrated for 2 days. There are two temple cars, the wheels of the cars are made of iron. In earlier days, the car was pulled by people alone, now bulldozers help to move the car. The traffic in the Avinashi road is increasing day by day, and because of this, the temple management is thinking of moving the car from the road side to some other place near the temple.
