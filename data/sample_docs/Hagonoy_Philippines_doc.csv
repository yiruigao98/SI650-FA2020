== History ==
Hagonoy was first mentioned in the history of the Philippines in 1571. Even before the "blood compact" between the Spain's conqueror Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and the Philippines' Datu Sikatuna was made, the place was already known as Hagonoy. The land consists of archipelagic marsh and river tributaries going to the sea, where the first ancestors of this town probably took this way to reach Hagonoy.
Hagonoy first appeared in Philippine history when they formed part of the fleet of Rajah Soliman of Macabebe, Pampanga that met Martin de Goiti at the Battle of Bangkusay in the initial defense of the Lusong Empire against the Spaniards in 1571.In the beginning, Hagonoy was part of Alcaldia de Calumpit as its visita together with Apalit. It has huge convent having founded on April 22, 1581 with Fray Diego Ordonez de Vivar as its first minister according to Gaspar's "Conquistas delas Islas" Book 2 (Fray Diego having credited for the christiniazation of Calumpit, Malolos and Bulakan). At first, it was also included in the territorial part of Encomienda de Calumpit that was given by Governor General Gonzalo Ronquillo to Sargento Juan de Moron for his good service and loyalty to Spanish Crown. Sargento Juan Moron once trusted his land to the Augustinian friars, and that's how it was handed to Fray Diego Vivar. It is also noted that on the primary sources documents such as Miguel de Loarca's "Relacion delas Islas" written in 1582 and Luis Perez de Dasmarinas report on King of Spain in June 1591 didn't mention Hagonoy as an independent encomienda or town, instead it is simultaneously with the much older town of Calumpit and it was officially established as a civil town in May 1671. According to records and old folks, there were already inhabitants in some places of this settlement.These places were Tibaguin and Pugad, coastal barrios sharing the coastline with the City of Malolos and towns of Bulakan, Obando and the City of Manila.
Magat Salamat, a revolutionary hero, and the last Prince of the Kingdom of Tondo, once headed this town. He was the ancestor of the Salamat families now living in different barrios of this town.


=== Origin of the name ===
The town was named after the "hagunoy" (Chromolaena odorata), a medicinal plant that used to be abundant in its river banks and along the seashores. The original populace used its leaves as their herbal remedy of choice for common illnesses and as food ingredients. Because of the medicinal value of the plant, the news of its effectiveness spread leading the people to call the place "Hagonoy".


=== Hagonoy's town legend ===
In the 15th century, some friars took a boat from Manila to the province of Bulacan and reached what was then called "Quinabaloan" (meaning "pinag-alaman" - which was then still part of the town of Calumpit). This is now the Barangays of Santa Monica & San Jose). At that time, a very charming lass was so popular among the young men of the locality. She had many suitors and admirers. One day, she felt ill. She needed someone to get leaves of the hagonoy plant by the river (which is now called Sapang Pari---because the friars and priests used this river to commute).
A man offered to promptly get some leaves of the plant and in deep gratitude, she promised to marry him. As he was gathering the leaves of the hagonoy plant for his dearly beloved, the group of friars in a passing boat stopped to ask him, "Quien vive?" (Where are we?). The man did not understand Spanish and was extremely intimidated by the guardia civil (Spanish civil guard) that escorted the friars. Thinking that they were asking what he was grasping in his hands, he quickly retorted "Hagonoy po!" (Hagonoy, sir!) and scampered away.
These were the first Augustinian friars that got into town and they noted the place's name as "Hagonoy". Hence, the origin of the illustrious town's name.

It is subdivided to 7 lots with a combined lot area of 412 hectares of municipal waters.

Fish traders from Lucena City, Quezon and Dagupan City, Pangasinan among other merchants of other provinces are regular bulk buyers the local ports or at the private "consignacions" (brokerage) of the large milkfish growers.
The coastal barrios are virtually 24/7 as fishermen go out to the sea at night for hours or even days while their loving families and relatives await them. Upon their return, their catch is immediately sorted out and sold at the local public markets and "talipapa" of the barangays. Their catch are also transported to the public markets in nearby towns and up to the public/private markets and supermarkets in Metro Manila.
Barangay Santo Niño adjacent to the Poblacion is host to the numerous brokers of prawns for the domestic and export markets.
