=== Culture of food and liquor ===
Zunyi is known for being a place where Chinese leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, visited to enjoy its fiery hot local cuisine, including yangrou fen (spicy hot rice noodle soup with lamb and bean curd).
This is made with Lai fen, a kind of thick wide round rice noodle that is made locally (at a factory in the town of Gaoping), and is difficult to find elsewhere.
The rice liquor Maotai (Moutai) is produced in the town of Maotai in Renhuai.  Another well-known local liquor is Dongjiu. The local beer Gaoyuan is quite delicious.
Liú èr mā mǐ pí (刘二妈米皮): This snacking dish made with thick flat rice noodles is eaten by locals frequently as a light meal or to tide off hunger. The red oil sauce makes liberal use of Sichuan peppercorn giving it a distinctive numbing quality on the tongue. It also leaves a peculiar tickle in the back of the throat making it worth a try. Aside from the red oil sauce, it contains a few scraps of meat and preserved vegetables.
Yángròu fěn (羊肉粉): Unlike its Guiyang cousin, this rice noodle dish is made using strips of mutton. Owing to the tastes of locals, yangroufen only comes available in a spicy broth. Addition of extra chilis during the cooking process is optional and you will be asked whether you want it or not. Yangroufen is rich and filling and often eaten for breakfast in Zunyi. Many shops remain open 24 hours making it a popular midnight snack as well. Pickled cabbage and radishes are available in the large glass urns in every shop - just help yourself. This dish is representative of Zunyi people who have a love affair with mutton.
NOTE: Mutton in China - the character 羊 (yáng) means both sheep and goat in Chinese. As a result, 羊肉 (yángròu) is usually translated as mutton. Most often in Guizhou at least, mutton refers to the meat of the 山羊 (shānyáng) which is a shaggy mountain goat raised for its hair and meat in the hills of the province.
Dòuhuā miàn (豆花面): douhuamian literally means "Bean Flower Noodles." It consists of Douhua which is a type of semi-firm tofu served in a semi-clear soup, long flat wheat noodles and a separate bowl containing preserved meat, spices, oil, soy, vinegar and fresh mint leaves. To eat as the locals do, place the bowl with the noodles and tofu behind the smaller dipping bowl. Pull out some douhua or noodles, dip them liberally in the sauce and then consume. At the end of the meal, finish off the solids in the dip and drink the soup from the douhua.
It is said that the local mountain water accounts for the quality of these locally brewed beverages, although pollution currently threatens the water of the Chishui River, from which Maotai is made.
