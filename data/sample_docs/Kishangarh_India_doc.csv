== Princely history ==

Kishangarh State was founded by the Jodhpur prince Kishan Singh in 1609.Prior to the rule of Kishan Singh this area was ruled by Raja Samokhan Singh who was a distant relative of Kishan Singh's family and  grandfather of Naubat Khan.

It had an area of 2210 km² (858 miles²) and a population in 1901 of 90,970. This figure for population represented a decrease of 27% over the census figure of 1891, something presumably attributable to the famine of 1899-1900. The state enjoyed an estimated revenue of £.34,000/- and paid no tribute to the British Raj. In 1840, Prithvi Singh, became the 15th Maharaja of Kishangarh, and reigned till his death in 1879, after which he was succeeded by his son, Sardul Singh.

Maharaja Madan Singh ascended the throne in 1900 at the age of sixteen, at a time when the state was reeling from the impact of a devastating drought. The administration under him and his diwan was widely deemed worthy of approbation; irrigation from tanks and wells was extended and factories for ginning and pressing cotton were started. A social reform movement for discouraging excessive expenditure on marriages made remarkable impact during his reign.Brijraj Singhji.

=== Gondulav lake ===
This is a lake situaed between the old city called purana shahar and the new city Madanganj. Boating and fish feeding are attractions for visitors. A paper published in the South Asian Journal of Tourism and Heritage describes the water quality status of Gundolav Lake in Rajasthan, which was once used for drinking water as well as for recreational activities under the tutelage of the princely state of Kishangarh. This has now become a site of waste water disposal and facing a critical threat for its sustenance.
Recent years have led to an increasing awareness of the importance of water bodies and the need for conservation of water bodies, especially freshwater wetlands. The Ramsar Convention (2002) identifies wetlands as the starting point for integrated water management strategies. This is because they are the source of fresh water, maintain the health of the water course and water bodies, have the capacity to supply water to meet the human needs and are a key to future water security.
The study aims at understanding the present situation and ecology of the lake, which can help in making attempts at restoring the balance between ecosystem and human activities in order to secure a continuous and sustainable improvement in the lake.
The physico-chemical and planktonic composition of the lake reveals that it is tending, fast towards 'eutrophism' . The quality of water is deteriorating day by day due to inflow of domestic sewage, municipal waste, agricultural runoff and effluents of organic waste of animal and human origin into the lake. This deterioration of water quality and eutrophication are assuming alarming proportions and can be attributed to the casual attitude of people concerned, with the development of the urban population.
The study argues for the urgent need to regularly monitor the water quality of the lake and to make attempts at diverting the city sewage away from the lake to preserve the flora and fauna of this ecosystem.

== Kishangarh Painting ==

Kishangarh painting emerged as a distinctive style in the middle of 18th century under the patronage of Maharaja Sawant Singh. Nihâl Chand, a gifted artist in the Maharaja's court, produced some highly individualistic sophisticated works. The chief characteristics of the Kishangarh paintings were the elongation of human faces and lavish use of green and depiction of panoramic landscapes. Portrayals of Radha and Krishna with sloped, receding foreheads are common subjects of Kishangarh paintings. Painters typically depicted long, lotus-shaped, half-closed sensual eyes. The thin lips and pointed chin of Radha standing in a graceful pose with her head covered with a muslin odhni, is also characteristic of the Kishangarh school. This style continued into the 19th century and a series of paintings of the Gita Govinda were produced in 1820.


=== Bani Thani ===
One of the most famous Kishangarh painting is called Bani Thani. The Indian government has engraved it on one of its postal stamps. The Bani Thani style of painting got its name from a story with a twist of romance to it. In the Kishangarh court during the 18th century there ruled a poet-king called Raja Samant Singh (1699–1764) who had eyes only for Bani Thani, a court singer and poet. Bani Thani's eyes were what drew Samant Singh to her, and so did her singing. Seeing Bani Thani singing in his court each day helped the king's heart grow fonder. Now Sawant Singh wrote poetry under the name of Nagari Das as a Bhakti saint, similar to Bani Thani herself, who was a poet. Chand repeatedly painted the king and Bani Thani together, and often deified the king to reference Krishna.
