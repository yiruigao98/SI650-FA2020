== Etymology ==
During the Mahabharata period in ancient India, a king named Rewat had a daughter named Rewati. The father used to call her Rewa, and founded a city "Rewa Wadi" named after her. Wadi and wada mean a neighbourhood (small and big, respectively) in Hindi and many other Indian languages. When Rewa married Balram, elder brother of Krishna, the king donated the city "Rewa-Wadi" to his daughter. In the course of time, the name Rewa-Wadi became Rewari.


== History ==
According to the folklore Rewari was founded by the Ahir King Rewat, who had a daughter named Rewa (meaning star), when she was married to Balarama (brother of Lord Krishna), the King Rewat gave way the city of "Rewa Wadi" as gift, which in due time became known as Rewari.

A small Ahir principality was established there in the early century and ruled over the surrounding Ahirwal area.

Rezang La near Chushul in Ladakh was the site of the last stand of C Company of the 13 Kumaon battalion, during the Sino-Indian War on 18 November 1962. The C Company was composed almost entirely of Ahirs and was led by Major Shaitan Singh, who won a posthumous Param Vir Chakra for his actions. 
In this action 120 men of the C Company fought until their bullets finished and then fought hand-to-hand. Of the 120 men, 114 died and only six seriously injured men remained alive. Of these, five were captured POW and only one came down to inform others. A memorial was constructed in Rewari city for them.
The soul-stirring inscription on the War Memorial at Chushul, Ladakh raised by Indian Army in the memory of the fallen brave Ahirs in the Battle of Rezang La reads:

How can a man die better,
Than facing fearful odds, 
For the ashes of his fathers, 
And temples of his gods.

=== Railway ===

Rewari was first connected by a railway line in 1873 when the first metre gauge railway track in India became operational. This track was laid between Delhi and Ajmer. The gauge was converted to 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge in 1995 for one of the tracks. This allowed metre gauge trains from Rajasthan to continue up to Delhi Sarai Rohilla on the remaining track. The second track from Rewari to Delhi was converted to broad gauge in 2007 as all the metre gauge tracks from Rewari to cities in Rajasthan had been converted to broad gauge by then. Thus all the railway tracks from Rewari have been converted to broad gauge obviating the need for change of trains at gauge-change stations such as Delhi and Ahmedabad.Rewari is a major junction on the Indian railway network and is connected to the major cities of India by direct trains. Six railway lines branch out from it to Delhi, Ajmer via Narnaul and Ringas, Ajmer via Alwar, Loharu, Hisar and Jhajjar-Rohtak. The latest sixth line to Jhajjar and Rohtak was constructed in 2008–12 and commissioned in January 2013. A seventh line was planned from Khori near Rewari to Asaoti near Palwal for facilitating carriage of goods on Western Dedicated Freight Corridor but the plan was abandoned as the farmers resisted acquisition of their land. This dedicated freight railway line is now being laid from Alwar to Asaoti near Palwal. A separate double track has been laid from Khori station just before Rewari for goods trains to bypass Rewari junction by going over Rewari-Narnaul and Rewari-Mahendragarh tracks and joining Rewari-Bhiwani track two km after Rewari. This will obviate the need for goods trains on Western Dedicated Freight Corridor to pass through Rewari junction.Rewari-Delhi double railway track was electrified in 2018. Rewari has electrified tracks on the Alwar-Rewari-Hisar and Rewari-Narnaul-Ringas-Phulera routes. These tracks have a high catenary with 7.45 m high OHE for double-stack containers. The electrical locomotives on these tracks will have a special pantograph for the high catenary. Electric trains (EMU) may run between Delhi and Rewari in 2020. Rewari-Alwar-Bandikui and Rewari-Bhiwani routes became double tracks in 2019.The alignment of a new railway line of Rapid Regional Transit System (RRTS) from existing Nizamuddin station in New Delhi to Gurgaon-Manesar-Dharuhera-Rewari-Bawal-Shahjanpur-Alwar has been finalised. It will have a railway station east of Rewari at village Majra Gurdas.

While NH 48 has existed for five decades, NH 919 was a state highway declared NH a decade ago, NH 352 was newly constructed in 2011–13 and NH 11 was declared to start from Rewari only three years ago. A new bypass on NH 11 from east of Rewari city (starting at NH 352 off NH 48) to west of Rewari city (at Khori railway station) is being constructed to bypass the city.
