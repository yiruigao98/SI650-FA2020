== Name ==
The indigenous people called the town of El Kseur Iɣil Mɛebed (in Berber). On the other hand, the name of El Kurs comes from the Arabic qasar, in Algerian Arabic qsar, plural qsur, meaning "palace" or "fortified village", berberized in Leqser; The municipality takes its name from a courthouse which gave its celebrity to the city. Another hypothesis, more probable, gives origin of the name the citadel (qasr) erected in 1327 during the siege of Bgayet by the Zianides. Ibn Khaldun speaks of it in his book "History of the Berbers".


== History ==
In Roman times, El Kseur was known as Tubusuctu (or even "Tubusuptu"). It was a Roman colony founded by Augustus for military veterans. Economically, the colony was known for its olive oil. Today, Roman ruins include baths, which are well preserved.


=== French Rule ===
During the colonization, El Kseur was in 1872 a center of European settlement. Many Alsatians and Lorrainers settled there, especially after the French defeat of 1870 against Prussia. Nearly 470 settlers settled in El Kseur, which took the name of Bitche. This name will not stay long since El Kseur or Ighil Maabed will take over. Today still the colonial district is present, it is on the national road, near the town hall in particular.
During the war in Algeria, El Kseur was one of the first regions in Kabylie to join the FLN in 1954, a group of wanted militants of the FLN of the region joined the maquis; Salah Hocine, Tahar Amirouchen, Khatri Madjid, Arezki Oukmamou and his brother Hocine, Mokrane Harani, Kamel Chikhi, Larbi Touati and so many others have to quote their why say so much else they are cleaner. They will all become valuable officers in the ALN. El Kseur was the scene of several battles between the colonial army and the guerrillas of wilaya III. Faced with a threat France set up prohibited zones in order to cut the resistance of the population and thus deprive them of popular support. Thus, in 1955, in the Aures first, then in Kabylia, and then in the rest of Algeria, population regrouping camps were built. In El Koire, at first, the mountaineers who had been driven out of their villages, often in violence, had to settle near the river in makeshift camps made by their care. It was in 1959 and in 1960, in the context of the realization of the Plan of Constantine, that houses were erected. They were mostly made at Berchiche, that is, far from European settlers. These regroupment camps were for some appalling, Michel Rocard presented them in 1958 as concentration camps of slow death. In Ighzer Amokrane, in the Soummam valley, nearly 1,000 people were piled up in deplorable sanitary conditions, infant mortality was very high and hunger deaths were counted by hundreds each month.
