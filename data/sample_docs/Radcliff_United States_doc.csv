Radcliff is a home rule-class city in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 21,692 at the 2010 census, and in 2019 the estimated population was 22,914. It is included in the Elizabethtown–Fort Knox Metropolitan Area.
Its economy is largely dominated by the adjacent U.S. Army base Fort Knox and by the nearby city of Elizabethtown. Radcliff's population previously fluctuated greatly depending on the deployments of the units at the base, but the BRAC reorganization of 2005, and the quartering of the U.S. Army's Human Resources Command to Fort Knox has created a larger and more stable population.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1956, Radcliff was first settled in 1919, when Horace McCullum subdivided lots along Wilson Avenue and sold them at auction to the highest bidder. McCullum named the new community after Major William Radcliffe, head of the Quartermaster Corps at the newly established Camp Henry Knox. After selling the general store he had opened in the new town, McCullum no longer played a role in its development.
The next significant step in Radcliff's history took place during the 1930s when Fort Knox expanded and dislocated the towns of Stithton and New Stithton, causing various residents and businesses of those communities to move to Radcliff. During World War II, thousands of soldiers trained at Fort Knox and spent their leisure hours at the USO in Radcliff.
Hardin Water District No. 1 was formed in 1953, and became a reality in 1955 with the sale of bonds to finance the project. Today, the water district is the principal source of fresh water to all Hardin County. Radcliff's fire department was established in 1955, with Joseph B. Hutcherson the first fire chief. The Radcliff Civic Club was also organized that year. The city incorporated in March 1956 as a 6th-class city. Radcliff Police Department was formed with officers paid on a fee basis. The population was estimated at 800. Radcliff's population growth over the last 50 years is due to the transient military population, and trends are showing a plateau and decline. At one time, Radcliff was larger than Elizabethtown, but that was short-lived after the 2000 census and more so after the BRAC transformation at the beginning of the 21st century. Starting with 800 in 1956, the Census Bureau reported populations of 3,381 in 1960, 8,281 in 1970, 14,519 in 1980, and 21,961 in 2000.
In 1988, a youth group from the First Assembly of God in Radcliff was involved in the worst drunk-driving accident in U.S. history, a bus accident in which a drunk driver going the wrong way on Interstate 71 hit the group's vehicle, killing 27 people.In mid-October 2011, the city voted to approve alcohol sales, which began in January 2012.
Former Kentucky state representative Mike Weaver was elected mayor in 2014 and took office in 2015 for a four-year term. City council members Barbara Baker, Stan Holmes, Edward L. Palmer, T. W. Shortt, Kim Thompson and Chris Yates were also elected in 2014 and took office in 2015, each for a two-year term.
The November 8, 2016, general election for Radcliff City Council ended with all current councilmembers reelected except Shortt, who had run for Kentucky State Representative. Radcliff community leader and businesswoman Tanya Seabrooks was elected to fill the seat Shortt vacated, defeating five other candidates. She took the oath of office in December 2016 for a two-year term. Shortt was defeated in his bid for state representative by the incumbent, Dean Schamore.
