Aranda de Duero is a town and municipality, capital of the Ribera del Duero comarca, in the south of the province of Burgos, in Castile and León, Spain. It has a population of roughly 33,000 people and lies on the River Douro. The closest international airport is Madrid Barajas.


== Description ==
The municipality of Aranda de Duero is made up of three towns: Aranda de Duero (seat or capital), La Aguilera and Sinovas.
Aranda de Duero is the capital of the Ribera del Duero wine region. The town is unique for having wine cellars that interconnect below the streets of the town centre. Wine clubs (peñas) celebrate special events in these cellars.


== Location ==
Aranda de Duero is at the junction of several transport routes across Spain. The N1 autovía (known as A-1) runs north / south by Aranda, along which visitors and import/export goods travel between Madrid and the south coast. Another important road running east to west connects Portugal with important cities on the way (e.g. Zamora, Valladolid, Soria) and the east coast. Its location at the juncture of these routes has led to Aranda de Duero acquiring a growing recognition and function as a business centre. Several multinational corporations, such as Michelin and GlaxoSmithKline have large facilities in the area.


== History ==
The Council of Aranda, an ecclesiastical synod, was held at Aranda de Duero in 1473 by Alfonso Carillo, Archbishop of Toledo, to overcome the ignorance and evil lives of ecclesiastics. Among the twenty-nine canons of the council is one which says that orders shall not be conferred on those who are ignorant of Latin. Several canons deal with clerical concubinage, simony, clandestine marriages, etc.


== Culture ==
A dish called "Lechazo" is a local speciality. This is roast baby lamb and is usually served with a basic salad and much "torta" bread for dipping in the meat juices.


=== Festivals and events ===
The Fiestas to honour la Virgen de las Viñas (Our Lady of the Vines) take place on the first Sunday after 8 September. They last for nine days from the eve of that Sunday (the Big Day) until the following Sunday when the Fiestas end with the traditional fireworks at midnight, followed by "the sardine burial".
The annual Sonorama music festival is held in the city in mid-August.
