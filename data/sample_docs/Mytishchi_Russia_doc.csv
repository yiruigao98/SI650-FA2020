The first settlement of ancient hunters and fishermen in this location is dated to the 6th–8th millennia BCE, i.e. in the late Stone Age.

In and around Mytishchinsky District about a dozen of such settlements from the 11th–13th centuries have been discovered.
The modern settlement has been known since 1460 and since the 19th century it has been known as Bolshiye Mytishchi (Большие Мытищи). Its history is closely linked to the Yauzsky port. Mytishchi was an important place on the trade ship route. Through this site commercial ships had been hauled across on wheels, rollers, or skids from the Yauza River to the Klyazma River. Merchants had to pay a duty for this. The settlement got its name thanks to the duty, which had been known as myt (мыт).
