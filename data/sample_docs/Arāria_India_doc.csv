Araria is a city and a municipality that is the headquarters of Araria district in the state of Bihar, India. Araria is situated in the northern part of Bihar.


== History ==
Araria, which was previously part of Purnia district, is part of the Mithila region. Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Mithila Kingdom (also called Kingdom of the Videhas).During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Kingdom of the Videhas became one of the major political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Kingdom of the Videhas were called Jankas.
The Mithila Kingdom was later incorporated into the Vajji confederacy, which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila.


== District statistics ==
Araria is primarily a rural district; 93% of the total population live in the rural areas (713 villages). Only two out of nine tehsils have urban population that is concentrated in Forbesganj and Araria(Census 2001).
In 2008 survey findings, Araria lagged behind the all India average in seven out of eight indicators and also lagged behind the all India level in terms of two more health related indicators. Most of the villages lack some basic infrastructure: 92 percent are without any medical facilities; 20 percent of the villages lack formal facilities of education of any type; 597 out of 713 villages are without electricity; and 50 percent of the villages are without all-weather road connectivity. The overall work participation rate is 40.3 percent, which is much less in case of the female population. Agriculture laborers dominate the labor force (64.7% of the total) that is almost double of the national average.
There is a substantial concentration of minority (mainly Muslims) population. Against the state average of 20.52%, Muslims constitutes 49.4 per cent of the total rural populations, but their percentages are 77.5% in Jokihat, 62.70% of Araria, and 46.8% in Palasi subdivisions. The number of minority groups - Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Jains - are negligible. The rural literacy rate is 33.2 percent, much below the state and national averages.
