The Caroli church is the oldest of Borås's buildings, and has withstood all fires.

== Climate ==
Borås has a cold oceanic climate, influenced by Atlantic trade winds travelling without major obstacles over the land, with low mean temperatures, compared to coastal areas and the more urban metropolis, Gothenburg, near to the west. Considering it being inland and quite far south, summer temperatures are rather subdued by Swedish standards, whilst winter average highs hover just above freezing. Being inland still enables severe extremes to sometimes occur, such as a 36 °C (97 °F) reading from July 1901, the warmest July temperature on record in Sweden, although not a national record (38 °C (100 °F) set on two different June dates and years on other stations). The coldest extreme was set in February 1966 with −34.1 °C (−29.4 °F), a severely cold temperature for southern Sweden.
By Swedish standards, the climate of Borås is very wet, with a precipitation average of 975 millimetres (38.4 in). This is also due to marine airflows coming from the Atlantic and easily being transported over lowland areas, where the precipitation eventually falls. This renders heavy solid or wet snowfall in winter and the freeze-thaw cycle is normally dominant, with irregular snow cover.
