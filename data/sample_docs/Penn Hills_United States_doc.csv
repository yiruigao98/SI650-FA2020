In 1788, when Allegheny County was formed, the area now known as Penn Hills was part of Pitt Township.

This new township was formed and named Adams, until August 1850 when the action of the court was reconsidered to change the name to McNair Township.  The name was again changed to Penn Township by Act of Assembly and approved on February 10, 1851.  In 1958 Penn Township became Penn Hills Township, and in 1976 Penn Hills became a home rule municipality.
