The Gubbi Gubbi people harvested bush food, fresh water mussels, oysters, fish, and some game animals, moving around the land to take best advantage of seasonally-available produce.
Each year in March, the Gubbi Gubbi people would hold Bunya Festivals to feast on the plentiful and nutritious annual nuts of the Bunya Pine.
