Koraput is a town and a Municipality in Koraput district in the Indian state of Odisha. Koraput town is the district headquarter of Koraput district.


== History ==
The district of Koraput derives its name from its headquarters the present town of Koraput. In ancient times when the Nalas were ruling over this tract, Pushkari near modern Umarkot was the capital city. In the medieval period Nandapur developed as a little kingdom under the Silavamsi kings that was later expanded by the Suryavanshi kings who arrived in the region in 13th century from Kashmir.  Later, Maharajah Veer Vikram Dev of shifted his capital to Jeypore and about the middle of the 17th century this town prospered under the British Administration. Koraput was chosen by the British in 1870 for better health prospects. The origin of the name of Koraput is obscure. There are several theories, none of which are convincing.
According to Mr. R.C.S.Bell the name of the town is ‘Kora-Putti’ or "the hamlet of the nux-vomica" and it is derived presumably from a tree or trees that must at one time have been prominent near the site. But today not a single tree of nux-vomica is to be found near about the town of Koraput and so the assumption or Mr. Bell is open to question.
According to second theory, Koraput is corrupted form of ‘Karaka pentho’ Karaka literally mans ‘hail-stone’. It is also believed that one ‘Khora Naiko’ laid foundation of the village during the time of Nandapur kings. He hailed probably from Ranpur and served under the Nandapur kings in the Militia, and for his faithful and meritorious services he has permitted to establish this village which was named after him as Khora Putu, and later on the name has been abbreviated to ‘Koraput’.
Koraput is also a Tourism Place. The town is surrounded by mountains, thick forests and waterfalls. This town also has many old temples. 
Marking a social success for others to emulate, the past two years, around 220 tribal villagers of the non-descript Bondaguda village under Similiguda block in the district has become totally free of open defecation with each of its 45 families constructing toilets in their homes.


== Adivasi communities ==

Koraput is a part of the tribal belt in southern Odisha. As the term 'tribal' often denotes a negative connotation, the indigenous people here prefer to be known as Adivasis, i.e. "original inhabitants". Many different Adivasi communities live in this district.
The traditional culture (including languages), knowledge and subsistence of the Adivasis are closely connected with local ecosystems.Most of the area was covered by thick forest until relatively recently. As a result of deforestation, industrialization and urbanization, many Adivasi communities have adopted new ways of life. However, many Adivasis maintain a tradition of selling produce (vegetables and fruit) in Sunday markets popularly known as Hat Poda (or haat).The Dongar Festival (or Parab) is held annually, ostensibly to showcase the way of life of Adivasis, in the first and second weeks of December, organised by the district administration. Many foreign tourists visit the festival. There has been criticism of the festival, with allegations that Adivasis are reluctant participants, who are paraded like "museum specimens" for the benefit of the tourism industry.
