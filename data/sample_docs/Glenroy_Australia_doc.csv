== History ==
The area was originally home to the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, before British colonisation and settlement of the Melbourne area started in 1835.
The Glenroy Estate bounded by the Moonee Ponds Creek, Camp Rd, the Northern Golf Club (inclusively) and Rhodes Parade, was purchased in Sydney in 1838 by speculators, Hughes and Hosking. The Camerons may have owned it as part of a Run before survey or just leased it from the speculators, and are credited with giving Glenroy its name. However, Donald Angus Kennedy, who bought the estate in the mid 1840s, bestowed the name according to his 1864 obituary in The Argus. Kennedy's mother was Grace (née Cameron).Initial development in the area started with a small settlement around the North East railway line at the end of the 19th Century, with the Glenroy Post Office opening on 22 October 1888.After World War II significant development occurred when organisations such as Australian National Airways, the War Services Homes Commission and the Housing Commission of Victoria developed large areas of Glenroy. Residential development continued rapidly through the 1950s, and a Glenroy East Post Office opened in 1958 (closing in 1977).
