== Etymology ==
Naic, Cavite is one of the former barrios of Maragondon, along with 1) Magallanes (named after the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan); 2) Bailen (named after a town in Spain wherefrom the Friar Baltazar Narváez came, but renamed and now, General Emilio Aguinaldo, after the first President of the First Philippine Republic; 3) Tagaytay City, a former part of Alfonso; 4) Alfonso, (named after the King Alfonso who ascended the throne as a youngster, after his mother, a child Queen abdicated—after being enthroned by a General -later Count- Narváez); and 5) Ternate (a town with three names, Ternate, Wawa, Barra. Ternate was the name of the home in Mollucas of the settlers who were sent by the Dutch and Portuguese to the Philippines to fight the Chinese Pirates; Wawa was the name for this Shores-rich little site; Barra was the name given for this "Docking Place or Site" of Maragondon.)
Better spelled NAIC as an acronym-for Nuestra Adorada (or Amable or Amante) Inmaculada Concepción, Spanish for Our Adorable (or Amiable or Loving) Immaculate Conception, referring to the Patroness of the then barrio, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, whose feast the barrio celebrated (and the town continues to celebrate) on December 8.Naic has several histories when it comes to the origin of its name. One theory suggests that it originated when a Spaniard asked a native about what the pig is doing and he said "na-igik" (crying sound of pigs), thus later on developed as Naic. Another one suggests that it came from a Spanish word "Ca - Naic" meaning "neighboring place" by which its mother town was the present Maragondon. Another theory put forward is that Naic is an acronym for Nuestra Adorada Immaculada Concepcion.  The town's name is the Spanish translation of the town's patron saint, Our Lady of Immaculate Concepcion. As an honor and reverence to Our Lady of Immaculate Conception, the town folks celebrate annually their town fiesta on every 8th day of December.


== History ==
Thousands of years ago, Naic was a part of the towering Mt. Taal. Naic was the western slope of the volcano until its internal eruption which led to the sinking of its apex in its present condition.
When the Jesuits discovered Maragondon in 1627, its total land area covers the whole of Naic, Ternate, and Magallanes (Vance; Saulo and De Ocampo, 1990; Medina, 1992). In 1758, the Jesuits founded a community in the western bank of the river (present Barangay Muzon) and made it into a "sitio" with a visita still under Maragondon.
In 1791, the community was finally made into a town with its population still in the western bank. The town was named Naic after the old archaic word "can(ia)ayic" meaning "town near one another" or "the other side" (Medina, 1992), while Alfredo B. Saulo contends that Naic is a highly cultured Tagalog word meaning "suburbs" or "countryside". Also in Malaysia, Naic means "overboard".
Moreover, due to the closeness of Naic to the population in Maragondon, Naic transferred its center in 1798 to the eastern bank of the river (the present poblacion)(Medina, 1992). Also during this time, the town was already a flourishing fishing and agricultural village (Villanueva, 1982). On the other hand, the church, since 1797, was under the secular clergy who were mostly Filipinos (Jose, 1997; Medina, 1992). Upon the "Royal Audiencia" issued in 1849, the church was transferred to the Dominican Friars in 1865. The Dominicans upon finding out that the land in Naic was fertile, built the Casa Hacienda de Naic (the present Naic Elementary School) to be the administration building for the overseer of the larger friar lands in Naic (Jose, 1996).
In the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1898, all the names of the towns in Cavite were filipinized, thus, the name of Naic was changed to "Maguagi". Furthermore, five events significant to the revolution took place in Naic. These were as follows:
1. The designing of the first official flag of the country which took place in Sulok, Naic, Cavite (the present Velamart).
2. The creation of the Naic Military Agreement, a document by which Andres Bonifacio sought to assert his authority as leader of the Philippine revolutionary government in defiance of Emilio Aguinaldo's government initiated in Tejeros (Casa Hacienda de Naic).
3. The appointment of the first cabinet ministers including the Departments of Interior, Justice, Finance, and Defence (Casa Hacienda de Naic).
4. The Battle of Timalan where the Filipino revolutionists won overwhelmingly against the Spanish troops (Timalan, Naic Cavite).
5. The Battle of Naic where Aguinaldo declared the town to be his last defense (Poblation) (Medina, 1996, de Achutegui, 1972; Aguinaldo, 1964; T.A. Agoncillo, 1963).
The prominent people who paved the way for the revolution in Naic included former gobernadorcillos and capitanes municipal; namely, Cirilo Arenas, Gregorio (Goyo) Jocson, in whose house General Aguinaldo recuperated from illness, Benito Poblete, and Tobal Bustamante.A sprinkling of upperclassmen could also be found in other towns of Cavite whose wealth came from rural landholdings, urban properties, and/or successful business ventures. The Cuencas of Bacoor, the Papa, De Castro, Valentin, and Arenas families of Naic, the Darwins of Indang, who were/are Spanish nobilities and margraves with ranks of Duques, Marquis, Condes and Vizcondes, pertained to this class.Naic is also the very first town in the country to pass an ordinance banning pigs from the street. It had been a perennial problem of the country. It is one of the greatest achievement of Naic because the other towns followed suit.

It is the 9th most populous and the 14th most densely populated municipality/city in the province. The massive increase can be observed in the year 1990 when industrialization was introduced in the Province of Cavite (including Naic). Investors established their businesses in different industrial estates that magnetized people to migrate to Cavite due to job opportunities the province offers. Another factor attributed to the increase of population is the mushrooming of housing subdivisions (such as Belmont Homes in Palangue and Dorothea Homes in both Halang and Calubcob). Natural increase also contributes to the increase in population. The population density of the municipality based on the 2015 census was 1,500 inhabitants per square kilometre or 3,800 inhabitants per square mile.
