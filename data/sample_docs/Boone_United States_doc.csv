== History ==

Coal mining played an important part in the early history of the Boone area. Local blacksmiths were already mining coal from the banks of Honey Creek south of what became Boone in 1849.
Boone was platted as a town in 1865 by John Insley Blair. It was incorporated the following year, when the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company railroad station was built there. The town was originally named "Montana"; it was renamed to Boone in 1871. The nearby town of Boonesboro was also chartered in 1866; Boonesboro was annexed to Boone in 1887. The present name is a tribute to Nathan Boone, son of explorer Daniel Boone.Commercial mining was spurred by the arrival of the railroad. In 1867, Canfield and Taylor opened a mine just west of town.  Their mine shaft was 242 feet deep, and they hauled coal to the railroad by wagon. In 1874, a railroad spur was built to the mine.  This mine was taken over by the railroad, and operated for 30 years.
There were coal seams in the Boone area; the upper vein, about 3 feet thick, was always worked using longwall mining, while the lower vein was always mined using room and pillar mining. In 1912, United Mine Workers Local 869 in Boone had 554 members, close to 10% of the population at the time.The grocery chain Fareway originated in Boone. The company maintains their business offices in town also.The first Casey's General Store was founded in Boone, Iowa in 1968.Other larger businesses that have had or still maintain facilities in Boone include Gates Rubber, Heinrich Envelope, Archway Bakery, Lowe-Berry Seeds, Coca-Cola Bottling, Quinn Iron & Wire Works (now Besser Quinn Machine & Foundry), Mid-States Steel, Sunoco Products, Specialty Leather Productions, Randy's Frozen Meats, PDM Distribution, ProLiant Biologicals, APC, Thermomass Composite Tech, CDS Global, Patterson Logistics and Stoll Bottling.

== Transportation ==
Boone is located on U.S. Route 30. The original Lincoln Highway ran through the center of town, but a new four-lane highway was built in the late 1960s that bypassed the center of Boone to the south. There is also a network of paved country roads radiating out in all directions.
Boone is served by the mainline of the Union Pacific, which purchased the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad (C&NW) in 1995. Boone was a division and crew change point on the railroad under the Chicago & Northwestern and some of that business remains today. There is a moderate-sized rail yard to the east of the downtown area. The locomotives no longer sound their horns in the town proper due to modifications to the various points where streets intersect with the rail line.
Boone was also the exact midpoint on the Fort Dodge, Des Moines & Southern Railroad, an electric interurban line converted to diesel in 1955 after a flood on the Des Moines River devastated the Fraser hydroelectric power plant that supplied power to the railroad. It connected with the C&NW downtown. It was purchased by the C&NW in 1968 and subsequently abandoned. The western part of the line to Fraser has been resurrected as the Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad, a tourist line.
The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad also ran a branch line into Boone from the southeast. It likewise connected with the C&NW. The line was trimmed back to Luther in the late 1960s and completely abandoned a few years later.

=== Tourist attractions ===
Vincenzo Miserendino's final and largest statue of Theodore Roosevelt, which was eight times life-size was commissioned in 1941, and was scheduled to arrive in Boone, Iowa, in 1943.  However, before casting, its 4,000 pounds of bronze was appropriated for World War II.  Miserendino commented that Theodore Roosevelt himself would have approved of that decision to put the service of the country first.  Later, in 1946, the Roman Bronze Corporation of Corona, New York City, produced the casting in Miserendino's original mold.  On January 6, 1948, it was placed in McHose Park.  Residing on three large granite blocks, the 6' 3" statue depicts Roosevelt rising out of a mountainous landscape with his hand outstretched as if addressing a crowd. Below the statue are ten bas reliefs of Roosevelt's outdoor accomplishments.Boone & Scenic Valley Railroad & James H. Andrew Railroad Museum is another point of interest. The B&SVRR allows you to view Boone and the Boone river valley area via train, riding behind various historic train equipment. Thomas the Tank Engine makes annual visits to B&SVRR, the Day Out with Thomas event, usually in September. The railroad also hosts several "dinner" trains, a regular weekly train excursion as well as a special Christmas themed event. The James H. Andrew museum, located on site, highlights railroad history with a variety of exhibits and actual railroad related artifacts.
