Watertown is a city in the U.S. state of New York and the county seat of Jefferson County. It is situated approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of the Thousand Islands, and along the Black River about 5 miles (8.0 km) east of its mouth at Lake Ontario. It lies 180 miles (290 km) northwest of Albany, the state capital, and 328 miles (530 km) northwest of New York City.  As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 27,023, an increase of 1.2% since 2000. The U.S. Army post Fort Drum is near the city.
Named after the many falls on the Black River, the city developed early in the 19th century as an industrial and manufacturing center. From years of generating industrial wealth, by the early 20th century the city was said to have more millionaires per capita than any other city in the nation.
Geographically, Watertown is located in the central part of Jefferson County. It lies 70 miles (110 km) north of Syracuse and 31 miles (50 km) south of the Ontario border. The city is served by Watertown International Airport.
The city claims to be the origin of the five and dime store and the safety pin, and it is the home of Little Trees air fresheners. It manufactured the first portable steam engine. It has the longest continually operating county fair in the United States. It holds the Red and Black football franchise, the oldest surviving semi-professional team in the United States.


== History ==

This was long part of the territory of the Iroquois Confederacy. In historic times, the Onondaga and the Mohawk had occupied this area. After the American Revolutionary War, they and other Iroquois nations were forced to cede most of their land to the United States under the terms of peace mediated by Great Britain. The US sold the land for development, mostly to migrants from New England.
The city of Watertown was settled in 1800 by pioneers from New Hampshire, most notably Hart Massey, Henry Coffeen, and Zachariah Butterfield, part of a large migration into New York from New England after the Revolutionary War. These pioneers chose the area due to the Black River, which flowed west into Lake Ontario about five miles away.
The pioneers' vision was for an industrial center that would draw power from the river. All the land was rough and forested. Elevation was also a problem. The western end of the town was 12 to 15 feet (3.7 to 4.6 m) higher than the eastern end, with a large depression in the middle. A small stream also passed through the town.
Within a few years, settlers cleared the center of town to create the ambitious Public Square. During the nineteenth century, several significant buildings were constructed around it. Together these have been designated as a historic district and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
In 1805 Watertown was designated by the legislature as the county seat of Jefferson County. It was incorporated as a village in 1816.As industry and businesses flourished, successful residents built substantial retail buildings, churches, and private residences close to the square. The Paddock Arcade, built in 1850 according to European and US models, is the oldest continuously operating enclosed mall in the United States. It is also listed on the NRHP, as are several significant churches and private mansions.
The drop in the Black River at Watertown's location—40 feet (12 m) in the center of town, and 120 feet (37 m) over 2.5 miles (4.0 km)—provided abundant water power for early industry. By the mid-19th century, entrepreneurs had built paper mills and major industries, including one to manufacture the first portable steam engine in 1847. In 1851, the city was joined to Albany and other major cities of the state by the railroad. Other mills were added to the business base, generating revenue to support the city's early public works projects, such as the water system and illuminating gas works in 1853, and a telephone system in 1879.
Watertown claims that Rodman native Frank W. Woolworth conceived the idea of his eponymous mercantile chain while working here in 1878. Woolworth, then employed as a clerk in Moore's Store, set up a successful clearance display of low-priced items. This led to his idea of a store specializing in fixed-price, cut-rate merchandise. Woolworth left Watertown and opened his first store in 1879 in Utica, New York, located to the southeast in the state.
Among the many manufacturing businesses was the Davis Sewing Machine Company, which originated in Watertown. It was predecessor to George P. Huffman's Huffy Corporation (NYSE: HUF), now a maker of bicycles and other sporting goods. Little Trees air fresheners were developed in Watertown in 1951; the Car-Freshner Corporation headquarters and manufacturing plant is located here.
In 1869, Watertown was incorporated as a city. In 1920, the city adopted a city manager-style of government. The Jefferson County Courthouse Complex is an example of the substantial architecture of the city, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. An early industrial city that earned great wealth for many of its citizens by the turn of the 20th century, Watertown also developed an educated professional class of doctors and lawyers.
A number of factors affected Watertown's progress. The economic center of the country kept moving west following development of the frontier and a shift of population into the Midwest. As Chicago boomed, it attracted many of the younger people from upstate New York for its  business and professional opportunities. In the mid-20th century, industrial technology shifted and jobs changed. In the restructuring of railroads and deindustrialization that took place in the mid- and late 20th century, Watertown suffered economic and population declines.
Today the city serves as the commercial and financial center for a large rural area. It is the closest major community to Fort Drum and the post's large population of 13,000. Since the city is located just 30 miles (48 km) from the international boundary with Canada via the Thousand Islands Bridge, shopping by Canadian visitors is an important part of the local economy. It also is part of an area receiving numerous tourists and summer residents annually.
Watertown, South Dakota, was named in the city's honor.

The Black River flows westward through the city toward Lake Ontario. The Black River is a world-renowned kayaking destination. Competition-level kayaking events, such as the Blackwater Challenge, have been held on the river.
By tradition, the city's name was derived from the abundant water power available from the river. Businesses harnessed water power to create one of the early industrial centers in New York, beginning with paper mills processing lumber.
Thompson Park, a creation of John Charles Olmsted, is located with entrances off Park Circle, Gotham Street, and Franklin Street.
Jefferson Community College (JCC) is located in the western part of the city near the county fairgrounds.

== Infrastructure and transportation ==


=== Rail ===
Watertown was the nexus of the Rome, Watertown & Ogdensburg Railroad, which was later absorbed into the New York Central Railroad  (NYC) network. Watertown sat at the junction of five different lines, as trains from Syracuse, Rome, Oswego, and Utica passed through Watertown on their way to points along the St. Lawrence River (principally, Ogdensburg and Massena) and to Canada. The Watertown passenger station, situated along the Black River behind Public Square at what is now J.B. Wise Place, was described as among the finest in the system. With the decline in travel by rail after World War II, however, the last named passenger train with a sleeper section to the town was the Iroquois in 1961; the train carrying sleepers south from Watertown was the Fifth Avenue / Cleveland Limited, also ending in 1961. Passenger service to Watertown finally ended in 1964. The station itself was demolished and replaced with a parking lot. Although the rail network is greatly attenuated compared to its peak in the early 20th century, CSX Transportation still transports freight by rail through Watertown.

It is a north-south route that runs from near Dandridge, Tennessee north to Hill Island, Ontario, connecting via the Thousand Islands Bridge and a short connecting road to Highway 401 across the Canada–US border.

NY 3 heads east into Watertown, overlapping with both US 11 and NY 12 through downtown prior to leaving the city to the northeast to head through the Adirondacks to Plattsburgh.
New York State Route 12 is a north-south route through the city, extending northward to Clayton then following the St. Lawrence Seaway to Morristown. A spur, NY 12E, takes a slightly-longer path through Cape Vincent before rejoining NY 12.
