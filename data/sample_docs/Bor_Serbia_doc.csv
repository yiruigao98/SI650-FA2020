In 1835, Miloš Obrenović invited August von Herder (son of J.G. Herder) to the Bor region to carry out geological investigations.
In 1903, the area with the copper deposits was bought by George Weifert and in June 1904 the copper mine with the co-operation of French companies opened.On 27 March 1941, Nazi Germany's leader Hitler ordered the attack on Yugoslavia.  in accordance with Führer’s directive No. 25 which mentioned that the possession of the industrial site of the Bor copper mines was very important for military purposes. In 1943, Hungarian-Jewish forced laborers were stationed at nearby mines which covered 50 percent of the copper requirement of Nazi Germany's war industry. In the period from July 1943 to September 1944, at least 6,000 Hungarians were used. In May 1943, the total number of inmates (excluding Kapos) came to about 23,000 forced laborers from Serbia.On 17 September 1944 (front)), a column of about 3,000 prisoners including Kapos left the camp under the supreme command of the German armed forces which were about 1000 strong were force marched to a pontoon bridge in Smederovo and then further on to Baja (via the eastern route).  
On 19 September, a second column of about 3,000 prisoners left the camp under the supreme command of the SS-Polizei-Gebirgsjäger-Regiment Nr. 18 and were force marched via Pančevo (the western route) to Baja. From Pančevo to Baja, the column was under the supreme command of a paramilitary operation echelon Deutsche Mannschaft „Hermann Göring“.
All prisoners were either used to build the south-east wall or transported by train to concentration camps such as Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau, Flossenbürg, Mauthausen, Oranienburg, Sachsenhausen, and Auschwitz. And last but not least, some national socialist Danube Swabian Officials including family members also took the opportunity to escape by train to Baja.During both forced marches, there were several attacks carried out by Yugoslav partisans.
