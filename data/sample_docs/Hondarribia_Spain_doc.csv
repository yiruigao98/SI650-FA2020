Hondarribia (Basque: Hondarribia; Spanish: Fuenterrabía; French: Fontarrabie) is a town situated on the west shore of Bidasoa river's mouth, in Gipuzkoa, in Basque Country, Spain.
The border town is situated on a little promontory facing Hendaye (France) over the Txingudi bay. A service boat makes the trip between the two cities. The town holds an ancient old quarter with walls and a castle. In addition, Hondarribia features a beach across the Bidasoa from the touristy housing estate Sokoburu in Hendaye, alongside a mountain called Jaizkibel providing a hilly backdrop to the town. A road leads north-east from the beach area to the Cape Higuer, located in this municipality.
The town harbours the San Sebastian Airport, which serves domestic flights. The population as of 2005 is 15,700 inhabitants.

The battles fought for possession of this fortified stronghold are generally known by the Spanish name for the place (Fuenterrabía).

Battle of Fuenterrabía (1521), in which Claude, Duke of Guise distinguished himself, was instigated by Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet, in command of the army of Navarre; he occupied the stronghold after the renewal of hostilities. The city was finally reoccupied by Charles V's forces in 1524 after the first Siege of Fuenterrabía.
Siege of Fuenterrabía (1638) was the outcome of a siege by the invading forces of Louis XIII, led by Condé.  27,000 French soldiers besieged the city for two months, firing 16,000 shells into the walled city, leaving only 300 survivors, most of them women and children. The city was virtually destroyed, but nevertheless did not surrender. The Spanish soldiers were successful, and the raising of the siege is celebrated annually on 8 September in a parade, known as Alarde.
Battle of Fuenterrabía (1719), during the War of the Quadruple Alliance.

The construction of a jetty and other ancillary works by the engineer Iribarren, created the beach (hondartza) of Hondarribia that provides a place to enjoy the waters of the bay. In the late twentieth century the beach was partially modified, building on its surroundings a recreational port and a sports center.
