== History ==


=== Etymology ===
The Municipality of Nabua traces the historical origin of its name way back during the Spanish Colonization. It was said that in 1571, an Augustinian Friar named Fray Alonzo Gimenez reached one of the rancherias called "Lupa" which was then under Datu Panga from Borneo.  The good friar found persons inside the said rancheria cutting coconuts.  He was offered to partake the inside shoot of coconut which the natives called “boa." Immediately, Fray Alonzo tagged the place as “Nabua” pronounced with his Spanish Accent. From that time onward, this place become popularly known as "Nabua."
In another version, a historian named Fray Felix Huerta claimed that the name came from the story that the original sitio of the town is in the shape a young coconut embryo which was surrounded by five rancherias named Lupa, Antacodos, Sabang, Caobnan, and Binoyoan. Other believed otherwise and said it was centrally located in the middle of said rancherias, thus closely resembling "boa."  For a time, the town was called “Nabobowa" but years of long usage shortened and corrupted it to the present name.


=== Early history ===

In 1578, a group of Franciscan missionaries led by Fray Pablo de Jesus and Fray Bartolome Ruiz put up a church in Antacodos where they placed a big cross.  These missionaries soon merged the villages of Lupa, Antacodos, Sabang, and Binoyoan into one place.
In a research mission to Spain funded by the municipality, it was learned that Nabua was officially established as a municipality on July 25, 1569.
Based on the 1734 Murillo-Velarde map, one of the earliest cartographic maps of the Philippine archipelago, the town is identified as "Nava" - a Spanish name indicating a "level piece of ground." This is probably the apt description of the place at that time, and until the present time, a flat terrain stretching from the shores of the lakes of Bato and Baao and nestled in the plains between Mt. Asog and the mountains of Bula and the then Pantao.

The municipality’s total population accounts for 4.3% of the total provincial population of Camarines Sur, ranking fifth behind much larger population sizes of Naga City, Iriga City, Libmanan and Pili.
Historically, the municipal population has experienced positive growth rate, beginning in Censal Year 1903 up to 1999.

This population shift in number can be attributed to migration patterns due to socio-economic reasons.

=== Religion ===

Many Nabueños are followers of Catholicism which is very apparent to the names of several barangays which bear the names of Catholic patron saints. However, culture, festivals and practices are of mixed Catholic and local beliefs of Bicolanos of pre-Spanish period. Iglesia ni Cristo on the other hand is the largest minority religion with several local congregations in the municipality and is growing rapidly.


=== Language ===
The Nabua-Balatan variant under lowland dialect (sinaranəw) of Rinconada Bikol can be considered having its base from the Bikol languages. However, there are other smaller social groups within the Bicol region where Nabua derives the foundation of its variant. The Rinconada area composed of Baao, Buhi, Bula, Balatan, Bato, Nabua and Iriga shares the same Rinconada Bikol language that the local folks are still enriching up to this day. The Nabua-Balatan variant can be easily recognized by the way they enunciate words or phrases when they talk or use the language. For being the mother town of all the municipalities and city in Rinconada area, the Nabua-Balatan variant is considered by linguistics as one of the foundation variants of Rinconada Bikol language.
Additionally, Spanish influences are frequently encountered in the languages of Nabuenos.  Some examples of Spanish words embedded in the local dialect are: “Abreyā raw iton puertan.” This is a command statement, meaning “Open the door” in English or “Buksan ang pintuan” in the Filipino language. The word “abreyā” is an inflection of the Spanish verb “abrir” (to open), and “puertan” is a shorten word of "puertāhan" which is from the Spanish word “puerta”.
Other variations of Spanish words being used in the Nabua-Balatan variant can be found, but many of these words or terms due to usage over time do not follow proper Spanish language conjugations and grammar.


== Customs and practices ==
Nabua has a rich array of customs and colorful practices that are found up to the present day.


=== Pangarana ===
This is the Nabua version of “serenading”.  When a man wants to show his intent to court a woman, the man (sometimes accompanied by his friends) armed with a guitar or possibly a karaoke machine shows up on the woman’s doorsteps unannounced late at night.  The woman or her family have either the option to turn on the lights and acknowledge the serenaders or just ignore them.  In some cases, the event turns into an unforgettable event as the woman’s family may come up with some unique ways to get the serenaders out of their property, such as throwing a bucketful of hot water or unleashing “bantay”, the household watch dog.


=== Pa-aurora ===
The local folks are religious in nature so it is common for them to make a religious promise or ‘panata’ expressing their exultation to God because of a bountiful harvest or they have a petition that they wish would be granted.  This is manifested through the local practice of “Aurora”.  On nine consecutive nights, they would decorate an improvised "carroza" for their local patron saint and then visit the households in the neighborhood with singing and prayers.


=== Pista sa mga Kalag ===
On November 1, nearly all citizens take a trip down to the cemetery.  This is their practice of honoring and remembering departed loved ones. They would offer flowers and light candles in their tombstones, sarcophagus, or decorate the family mausoleum with flowers and food.  The local cemetery comes alive the night of November 1 to commemorate All Saints Day until the early morning of November 2 for All Souls Day.  Masses at the cemetery are often offered on both days.


=== Tang-gal kin Cuaresma ===
During the season of Lent, some of the prominent families in Nabua will sponsor a “Tang-gal”. Tang-gal is the re-enactment of Jesus Christ’s Passion and Death on the cross.  After the passion of Christ is re-enacted, the “tang-gal” is concluded with “Ire-Helena”, the story of Helene and Constantine in search of the True Cross.


=== Pag-li-li ===
When a family member or loved one dies, the family, friends and relatives of the dead offer nine days of prayers. This is the nine days of mourning where they go to the local church to attend Mass and then continue their novena prayers at the house of the deceased.  Prayers are offered to help the soul of the deceased rest in peace and at the same time to console the grieving family.


=== Katapusan ===
After forty days of mourning, the family, friends and relatives of the dead celebrate the passage by hosting a feast and invite all those who consoled them in their time of grief.  Once everyone invited are gathered, they say the litanies and pray the Rosary of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.  Local folks believe that the soul of their dead have now passed the stage of “roaming” and ready to rest in eternal peace.  This is the time to let go and as a symbolism, they can now wear other colors of clothing instead of the traditional all black or all white.


=== Dotoc ===
Before the baranggay fiesta, "Dotoc" is a custom of Nabueños in honoring their patron saint through nine nights of thanksgiving.


=== Segunda Dia ===
The day after fiesta. It is a dance extravaganza played with folk, country, and novelty songs that the married couples, widows, widower and senior citizens dance in a dance floor. This make more fun and recreation for them especially for the balikbayans, or overseas locals, that will remember the steps of Codot-codotan.

Most of the families of these servicemen reside in Southern California, particularly in the San Diego area.  During religious and special holidays, these U.S. based Nabueños plus a growing number of Nabua natives now residing in other parts of the world would unfailingly return to their beloved Nabua, tagging along their friends, and freely spending their hard-earned foreign currency which definitely boosts the local economy and tourism.


=== Boa-Boahan Festival ===
Nabua celebrates its fiesta with the now-famous annual Boa-Boahan Festival on the third of May. The highlight of the festival is the reenactment of the traditional "Boa Feast," a 13th-century rite where ancient Bicolanos offered chains of coconut embryos called boa to their pagan deities, in the belief that this would give them ample harvests, favorable weather, and make their lives more prosperous and happy throughout the year. The feast is enlivened with frenzied street theater, heart-pounding street dances and spectacles, and a riveting display of colorful and dazzling ethnic costumes. This annual festival was initiated and given unprecedented impetus and funding by then Mayor Ulpiano Duran and the town's first lady then, Mrs. Delia Duran, in tandem with the late District Supervisor Mrs. Patricia Romano and the principals, teachers, and pupils from both public and private schools.
The first-ever festival was held in 1974, a street pageantry that was graced in the evening by a memorable dramatic revue performed by the legendary U.P. Mobile Theater under Professor and National Artist Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero, with the help of the touring company's long-time national coordinator, Mr. Timothy O. Albano (incidentally, he and his staff volunteered to research extensively the legend and authentic lore behind the festival's underlying mythology).
The late U.S. Engr. Cleto Descalso, a Nabueño philanthropist who chose to retire in Nabua after the decades he spent working in the United States, generously funded the creation of the Descalso Garden Park near the Municipal Hall. This exquisitely-designed garden became the staging point for this first festival.  A poetry-reading featured during the first Miss Boa-Boahan/Alinsangan beauty pageant was delivered by National Artist Mr. Riyoh Alma (Virgilio Almario). The guests of honor who helped crown the first Miss Boa-boahan Festival had included the commanding generals and commodores from both the Subic Bay Naval and Clark Air bases.
