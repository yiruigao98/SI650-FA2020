== History ==
Tagalog literatures in Balayan were lost and destroyed at the coming of the Spaniards. Jesuit Father Chirino testified they found (300) three hundred pre-colonial manuscripts in Balayan but to facilitate them the propagation of the Roman Catholic faith, early Jesuit missionaries destroyed the records.Scholars and historians believed that Tagalog songs: Kumintang and Kundiman originated from Balayan. Spanish writer and historian Wenceslao E. Retana recorded the lyrics of a popular Kundiman when he visited Batangas in 1888.Balayan has a close affinity to early history. The towns position on the basin of a good harbour was one of the reasons it became the first lands for local settlements in the Philippines, with existing records of local indigenous residents exchanging barter goods with Chinese traders dating back to the mid-14th century.It was once the capital of a Moro Sultanate named Bon-bon whose area includes Mindoro to Cavite and even some parts of Metro Manila. The indigenous inhabitants of Balayan has close ties with the Brunei Sultanate of Maynilad under the leadership of Rajah Sulayman I and his uncle Rajah Matanda. There are historical accounts that Rajah Sulayman I stayed on this area when he tried to battle the Spaniards around Intramuros.Despite the presence of Spanish forces protected by the newly built stonefort in nearby Maynilad or Manila, Fort Santiago and Fort Intramuros Philippines, due to its natural harbor, a number of areas around the archipelago were often become launching grounds of counterattacks from the seafaring Moro people.
These events prompted local Spanish officials to set up a fort to prevent yearly Moro counterattacks.
