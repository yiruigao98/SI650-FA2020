== History ==
Present-day Talavera was formerly a barrio of Cabanatuan City. It was called “Katugian” which means a place abundant in “Tugue,” an edible root crop.
The distance between Cabanatuan's town center and Katugian was critical during the early phase of its development although it was only 15 kilometres (9.3 mi). The parish-curate at that time recommended to the Spanish administrators a separate and independent administration of Katugian.
By a royal decree issued on November 12, 1852, the plan making Katugian a town was approved. There was no formal inauguration of the new town in accordance with the royal decree. However, the Augustinian parish-curate of Cabanatuan, Fr. Gregorio Crisostomo, appointed the first officials of the town by sending his co-adjutor, a certain Pedro Estanislao Pascual, to handle the religious phase of the administration of the new town during Sundays and Holidays only.
The first barrios that composed the new town were La Torre, Pulong Buli (Now Santo Domingo), Concepcion and Valle. Based on the petition presented to the Alcalde Mayor (governor) of Nueva Ecija, forwarded to the governor general in Manila, the “Talavera of the Crown of the Princess” was approved on February 17, 1853, by the Governor General.
In 1954, Talavera lost some territory when the barrios of General Luna, Morcon, Mabini, Ricarte, Casili, and Picon, together with sitios Plaridel and Bosque were separated to form the town of Llanera along with some territory from Rizal and San Jose.
