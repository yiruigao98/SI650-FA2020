Eagan () is a city in Dakota County, Minnesota, United States. The city is south of Saint Paul and lies on the south bank of the Minnesota River, upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River. Eagan and nearby suburbs form the southern portion of Minneapolis–St. Paul. Eagan's population was 64,206 at the 2010 census, making it Minnesota's 11th-largest city. The sixth-largest suburb in the metro area, Eagan is predominantly a commuter town for Minneapolis and Saint Paul.Eagan was settled as an Irish farming community and "Onion Capital of the United States". Its largest growth took place after Highway 77 was relocated and expanded and a six-lane bridge (with three northbound and three southbound lanes) was constructed over the Minnesota River in 1980 and the final Interstate 35E freeway section southbound from Minnesota State Highway 110 in Mendota Heights to the area where it joins 35W in Burnsville was completed in the mid-1980s. Eagan's northern border is mostly along Interstate 494. Its southern border is about a mile south of Cliff Road. Its eastern border runs mostly along Minnesota State Highway 3. The western border runs mostly along the Minnesota River's south bank. The city's influence in the region grew when Northwest Airlines (now Delta Air Lines) and Thomson West (now Thomson Reuters) established their headquarters there.

Eagan's municipal government is a Type B Statutory City, which provides for a council size of five members, one of whom is the mayor. Eagan's mayor since 2007 has been Mike Maguire (4th term as mayor, councilmember since 2003, seat up again in 2022).
The other councilmembers are:
Paul Bakken (5th non-consecutive term, 1997 and since 2007, seat up again in 2022)

Cyndee Fields (4th term, since 2001, seat up again in 2020)
Meg Tilley (4th term, since 2001, seat up again in 2020)In general, city government is nonpartisan. Candidates need not be (and usually aren't) selected or endorsed by political parties, and no such endorsement appears on the ballot by state law. All five council seats including the mayor are elected at-large in a general election every four years. Terms are staggered with two councilmembers elected one election cycle and the other two and the mayor two years later. The non-mayoral seats are elected in pairs, giving voters the chance to vote for up to two candidates. If necessary, races are narrowed down during a primary election.
As a part of Dakota County, Eagan's northern and western precincts (1-7, 9-12) join with regions northward to form the Third District on the County Commission. It has been represented by former Eagan Mayor Thomas Egan since 2005. The southern and eastern portions of the city (precincts 8, 13-17) are joined by regions south and east to form the Fourth District of the County Commission, which has been represented by Nancy Schouweiler since 1999. County commissioners serve four-year terms.
Eagan is in Minnesota's 2nd congressional district, represented by Angie Craig since 2019.
Since redistricting last occurred in 2012, Eagan straddles two Minnesota State Senate districts. Sixteen of Eagan's 17 precincts are joined with five precincts in neighboring Burnsville to form Senate District 51, represented by Senator Jim Carlson (DFL). Eagan's northernmost precinct is part of Senate District 52, represented by Senator Matt Klein (DFL).
In the Minnesota House of Representatives, each Senate District is divided into an "A" and a "B" side. The western half of District 51 makes up House District 51A, represented by Sandra Masin (DFL). The eastern half of District 51 makes up House District 51B, represented by Laurie Halverson (DFL). Regina Barr (R) represents precinct one as part of House District 52B.

Recently there have been two city questions that have gone to the ballot for city residents to vote for. In 2008, the citizens voted 53% to 47% to allow for private development of a defunct golf course instead of having the City purchase the land for future public development or open space. In 2004 and in 2007, voters were presented with plans drafted by an established Charter Commission calling for the city to scrap its current governing structure as a statutory city and adopt a new home-rule city charter. The measure failed 80% to 20% in 2004 and 91% to 9% in 2007. The Charter Commission was dissolved on June 18, 2008.
