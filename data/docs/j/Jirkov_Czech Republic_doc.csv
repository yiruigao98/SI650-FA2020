Jirkov (Czech pronunciation: [ˈjɪrkof]; German: Görkau) is a town in Chomutov District in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 19,000 inhabitants.


== Geography ==
Jirkov is situated between Most and Chomutov, on the Chomutov – Ústí nad Labem railway line. Although geographically close to the German border, the presence of hills along the border hinders land travel to Germany.


== History ==
Until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the Komotau (Chomutov) district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.
From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. After the surrender of Germany, nearly all of the town's hitherto inhabitants were expelled, and new Czech settlers found a new home in the depopulated city.

Červený Hrádek (formerly Borek Castle) was founded by the Kraa family prior to 1415. The castle was sacked by the Hussites in 1421 and, after renovation later in the 15th century, the façade was painted red – hence the name Červený Hrádek (or Red Castle). In 1687 and 1688, the baroque sculptor Jan Brokoff carved statues, fountains and other works at the castle. His son Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff, also a sculptor, was born there. The last aristocratic family to own the castle were the Hohenlohe-Langeburgs, Accessible areas of the castle include the castle's chapel, the hall of mirrors, the gallery and the study of Max Hohenlohe, the last owner.
