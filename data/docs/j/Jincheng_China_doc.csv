Jincheng is a prefecture-level city in the southeast of Shanxi province, China, bordering Henan province to the south and southeast. It is an industrial city in an area where coal mining is an important industry. The entire city has a population of 2.2 million.The presence of such a large coal industry has given Jincheng a reputation for air pollution and in recent years the local government has invested heavily to promote better air quality in the city. This includes tree-planting, establishing and maintaining large parks and ecological reserves, shutting down or relocating some of the worst-polluting factories, and the generalized use of coalbed methane which burns much cleaner than coal.


== History ==
Jincheng has a long history. During the Warring States period, Zhao, Wei and han divided the land of Jinguo and settled the Late Jin monarch in Qinshui County of Jincheng. At the end of the Warring States period, the famous battle of Changping broke out between Qin and Zhao, which was in Gaoping City of Jincheng. After the first emperor of Qin unified the six countries, China was divided into 36  Shire , and most of Jincheng and Southeast Shanxi belonged to ShangdangShire . After the Han Dynasty and the Wei Dynasty, Jincheng has always belonged to Shangdang Shire  and Pingyang Shire . To the Sixteen States, West Yan Murong Yong set up JianxingShire  in the south of ShangdangShire , which is also the beginning of Jincheng becoming a Shire today. After that, Jianxing Shire changed its name several times. It was changed to Jianzhou in the Northern Wei Dynasty, and then to Zezhou in the Sui Dynasty, until it was upgraded to Zezhoufu in the Qing Dynasty. They are basically consistent with the five counties under the jurisdiction of Jincheng today. Until the period of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai issued a policy to change all Chinese State into counties.
