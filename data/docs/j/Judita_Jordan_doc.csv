This is a list of fictional characters appearing in the stories set in the Honor Harrington universe or Honorverse, a best-selling series of over twenty military science fiction novels and anthologies invented and written by David Weber.
The stories in the five existing  anthologies serve to introduce characters, provide a deeper and more complete backstory, and flesh out the universe, so they claim the same canonical relevance as exposition in the main series. Universe creator David Weber serves as editor for the anthologies, maintaining fidelity to the series canons.
