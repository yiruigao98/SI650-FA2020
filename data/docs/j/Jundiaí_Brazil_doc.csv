== History and Geography ==
The municipality was officially founded on December 14, 1655, when it was elevated to the category of village. Its first urbanization was carried out in 1657. Jundiaí has borders with Várzea Paulista, Campo Limpo Paulista, Franco da Rocha, Cajamar, Pirapora do Bom Jesus, Cabreúva, Itupeva, Louveira, Vinhedo, Itatiba and Jarinu.

The name of the town comes from the Tupi language, and it means the place of the jundiá ("fish with barbs", the Rhamdia quelen species).
The city received massive numbers of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and early 20th century, making most of the city's inhabitants of Italian descent.
Amongst other immigrant groups, there are: Portuguese, Spanish, German and small amounts of Hungarian and Slavic peoples.
Recently, Jundiaí has enjoyed a steep population growth, in large part fueled by a shift of residents from the megalopolis of São Paulo, seeking better living conditions.


== Tourism ==
The Serra do Japi (Japi mountain range), situated southeast of the city, is a state park that has a natural reserve with one of the largest forested areas in the state of São Paulo, with beautiful landscapes and many opportunities for ecotourism, large hotel-farms and extreme sports.
The Jundiahy section is a historical area amongst the rivers Jundiai, Guapeva and Mato. It is an affluent neighborhood with fancy houses, gardens and a traditional small community business.


== Sports ==
Paulista is the city's football (soccer) club. The team, which plays at Jayme Cintra Stadium, was the champion of Copa do Brasil 2005 (Cup of Brazil).


== Transportation ==
The Jundiaí Airport serves the city and region for small airplanes.
Jundiaí has a connection in the Jundiaí station with Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM).
It has a system of public transportation that currently costs R$3,00 (USD 1,45) for one way [1]. Most of the buses have wheelchair lifts and a few have monitors that broadcast videos about the city and education. The lines are all connected by terminais (terminals), what makes the users' traffic faster and cheaper since there is free circulation in the terminals to the linhas alimentadoras (feeding lines), which carry the passengers from the terminals to their respective destinations [2]. Yellow and reloadable electronic cards that replace cash may be used by regular users that perform a register; students have a blue card that charges only half instead of the ticket's full price; the elderly or disabled own a grey or green card which allows free admittance.
