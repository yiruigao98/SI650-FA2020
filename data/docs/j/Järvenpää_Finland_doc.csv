Järvenpää (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈjærʋemˌpæː]; Swedish: Träskända) is a town and municipality in Finland.


== History ==
Järvenpää was separated from its parent community Tuusula in 1951. Järvenpää was granted the status of a market town (kauppala) after the separation. Neighbouring districts Kellokoski and Nummenkylä were not added to the municipality of Järvenpää and the controversy over the issue still raises blood pressure fifty years later. In the event, Kellokoski remained part of the municipality of Tuusula.
Järvenpää was granted full legal town (kaupunki) status in 1967.


== Geography ==
Järvenpää is located on the Helsinki–Riihimäki railway track, some 37 kilometres (23 mi) north of Helsinki. Neighbouring cities are Tuusula, Sipoo and Mäntsälä. People also refer to Kerava as Järvenpää's neighbour, even though they do not technically share a border, thanks to the one kilometre-wide land area that belongs to Tuusula.


== Traffic ==
The railroad goes through the city centre. In addition to the main railway station, there are the stations of Ainola, Saunakallio and Haarajoki.
The trip to Helsinki takes about half an hour, whether by rail or road, and to the airport of Helsinki-Vantaa about 20 minutes. Train connections to the capital are good. Uusimaa's trains leave the main station twice an hour, and from other stations once an hour.


== Culture ==

Järvenpää had, in the early 20th century, a large artist community, including: Jean Sibelius, Juhani Aho and Eero Järnefelt. This was partly true because of a railway connection to Helsinki.
Järvenpää is widely known as the location of Ainola, the home of the composer Jean Sibelius. It is situated about two kilometers south of the city centre. The composer moved with his family to the cottage designed by Lars Sonck on September 24, 1904, and he lived there until his death in 1957. Ainola is open for visitors in the summer months as the "museum of Sibelius".Juhani Aho moved with his wife Venny Soldan-Brofeldt to Järvenpää in 1897. They lived there for fourteen years in a villa, called Vårbacka, next to the shore of Lake Tuusula. The villa was later called Ahola.The K-Citymarket of Järvenpää was awarded the Grocery Store of the Year title in 2019 by the IGD of the United Kingdom.
