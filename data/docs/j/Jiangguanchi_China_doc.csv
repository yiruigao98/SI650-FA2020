This is a list of township-level divisions of the province of Henan, People's Republic of China (PRC). After province, prefecture, and county-level divisions, township-level divisions constitute the formal fourth-level administrative divisions of the PRC. However, this is not the case with Jiyuan City, which, as a sub-prefecture-level city, is also a county-level city under the direct administration of the provincial government; there township-level divisions form the third-level administrative division. There are a total of 2,341 such divisions in Henan, divided into 452 subdistricts, 855 towns, 6 ethnic towns, 1,016 townships, and 12 ethnic townships.
