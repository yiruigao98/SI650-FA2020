Jiagedaqi or Jagdaqi (Oroqen: Jagdaqi, meaning "area with Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litvin"; simplified Chinese: 加格达奇区; traditional Chinese: 加格達奇區; pinyin: Jiāgédáqí Qū) is a district and the de facto seat of Daxing'anling Prefecture, Northeast China. Its physical location is in Inner Mongolia; however, it is de facto under the jurisdiction of Heilongjiang Province due to no suitable location of seat in Daxing'anling itself. The government of Inner Mongolia disputes this arrangement.
