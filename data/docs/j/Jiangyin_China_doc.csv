== History ==

Jiangyin was a township of Yanling (延陵; later known as Piling, 毗陵) county initially. Since the township was located in the north of Ji Lake, it was given the name "Jiyang" (暨陽). In 281, it was promoted as a county of Piling commandery. In 558,  the north-west part was taken away from then Lanling county (Wujin and its around areas) to create Jiangyin county. It was served as the seat of Jiangyin commandery, of which jurisdiction equating to the modern city's, until the commandery was dissolved in 589. It was elevated to jun (military prefecture) status during Southern Tang, until being restored as a county of Changzhou in 1071. It developed as an important port for overseas trades, and a Maritime Trade Supervisorate (市舶提擧司) was established to manage in 1145. The county became a zhou (smaller prefecture) during Yuan dynasty, but was reduced to county status again in 1367.In 1472, the sandbank in the Yangtze River was independent from the county to establish Jingjiang county. In 1645, the draconian enforcement of the decree adopting the Manchu hair style and dress inflamed the local Han Chinese people's spirit to resist. Since the ultimatum "either lose your hair or lose your head" was given, they held the walled city against Qing sieges under a magistrate Yan Yingyuan (閻應元) 's leadership.On 23 April 1987, Jiangyin was approved by the State Council of China to become a county-level city.
