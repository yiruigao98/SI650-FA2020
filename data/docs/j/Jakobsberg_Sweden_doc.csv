Järfälla Municipality (Swedish: Järfälla kommun) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden, and is considered a suburb of Stockholm. Its seat is located in Jakobsberg, part of the Stockholm urban area.
Järfälla has not been amalgamated with other municipalities in the two local government reforms carried out during the 20th century. The Stäket area in the north was, however, added in 1952.
It is located about 20 km north of Stockholm, with a part situated by the shore of Lake Mälaren. It takes about 20 minutes to reach downtown Stockholm by Stockholm commuter rail.


== History ==
Järfälla traces its history to the Stone Age and has some ruins from that time. After being Christianized in the 11th century, a church was built around the year 1200 that still stands today. Järfälla continued to be of some importance in the Middle Ages as several important roads went through it. Furthermore, the centre of the hundred was located within the boundaries of the municipality from 1675 to 1905
Its coat of arms, which depicts a golden lamb carrying an archbishop's cross, can be traced from 1568, but was created in 1955. They may symbolize that Järfälla is situated on the road from the capital Stockholm to the seat of the archbishop in the nearby city of Uppsala.
The main population expansion came in the 1930s and 1940s, when many residential houses were built in the seat Jakobsberg for middle-class families commuting to Stockholm.


== Public transportation ==
The municipality is served by the Stockholm public transport system. There are three Stockholm commuter rail stations, Barkarby, Jakobsberg and Kallhäll, as well as a bus network. As part of a larger plan for the Stockholm region, Barkarby station and Barkarbystaden will get metro stations, scheduled to open in 2026. The representatives for the municipalities signed the deal in January 2014, and on 3 March 2014 Järfälla municipal council made the formal decision to fulfill their part of the deal.
