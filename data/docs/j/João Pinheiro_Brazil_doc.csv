== History ==
The process of colonization of the region, now occupied by the city of João Pinheiro began probably in the half of the 18th century, the period preceding the discovery of gold mines in the regions with the movement of inputs and flags bearing the lands of Paracatu.
Prior to occupancy by the white man, the territory was inhabited only by Amerinds (the tribe of Cataguá) and fugitive blacks of Paracatu and Goiás mines
By 1818, near the banks of the Vereda Extreme came a small town founded by pioneers and drovers who sought the captaincy of Goiás, this was the first landing of the white man in these parts. However, some of these adventurers settled animated by livestock and the diamond mines in the Rio Santo Antônio. It was a fever and this became the main activity of the camp nascent.
The town was named Santana Cheerful, this was the first name of the primitive camp belonging to the bishopric of Pernambuco - which gave the municipality current.
According to oral tradition, a very brave Curraleiro ox that lived in the vicinity of the site, often in the evening, went to the camp and remained there throughout the night mooing. The habit of that animal, called Alegre, intrigued everyone. It is said that this was the reason for the name of settlement.
