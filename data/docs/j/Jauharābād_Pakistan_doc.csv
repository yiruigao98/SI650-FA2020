Jauharabad (Urdu: جَوہرآباد‎) is the district headquarters of Khushab District, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Jauharabad was established in 1953 as a planned city. Jauharabad is named after Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar, a prominent figure from the Pakistan independence movement. It is included in the Khushab district of Punjab, located in the Northern part of the country. Key locations near Jauharabad include the Salt range to the north and Khushab, the Jhelum River, and the Mianwali District to the west.


== Etymology ==
The Urdu word Jauharabad also means "atomic city" in English.  Although it would seem to be related to the nearby Khushab Nuclear Complex, which lies 30 km south of Jauharabad, it is purely coincidental as the town was planned and constructed 33 years prior.


== History ==
Jauharabad was developed in 1953 under a master plan. Because of its planned design including open spaces and wide avenues, the district headquarters of Khushab District was shifted from Khushab city to Jauharabad. It was planned to be the capital city of Pakistan before Islamabad. Jauharabad is one of the few planned urban settlements in Pakistan (others being Faisalabad, Sargodha, Islamabad, and Gwadar), developed from scratch under an urban master plan.

The famous Islamic thinker, scholar and Jewish convert to Islam, Muhammad Asad (formerly Leopold Weiss) — author of The Road to Mecca, The Message of the Qur'an and Principles of State and Government in Islam, stayed at Jauharabad in the 1950s. He resided at the bungalow of the town's prominent resident, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan; who on the advice of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, had established the Dar ul Islam Trust Institutes first in Pathankot, India, after Pakistan's independence, in Jauharabad.


== Geography ==
