Joinville-le-Pont is a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 9.4 km (5.8 mi) from the center of Paris.


== History ==
The commune was created in 1791 under the name La Branche-du-Pont-de-Saint-Maur (literally "The Branch of Saint-Maur's Bridge") by detaching its territory from the commune of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés. The commune was renamed Joinville-le-Pont (literally "Joinville the Bridge") on 29 August 1831.  Under Louis-Philippe of France, the Redoute de Gravelle was built in the commune.
In 1929, the commune of Joinville-le-Pont lost more than a third of its territory when the city of Paris annexed the Bois de Vincennes, a part of which belonged to Joinville-le-Pont.
