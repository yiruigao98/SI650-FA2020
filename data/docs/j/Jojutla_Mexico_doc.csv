Jojutla is a municipality in the state of Morelos, Mexico. Its municipal seat is the city of Jojutla de Juárez. The name Jojutla comes from Nahuatl Xoxōuhtlān (pronounced [ʃoˈʃoːʍtɬaːn]) and means, Place of abundant blue skies. Another interpretation is Jojutla should be written Xo-Xoutla and its etymological roots come from: xoxou-ki, (dye called indigo) and Tla-ntli, (teeth) to indicate abundance, so the name means: Place abundant in blue paint. This meaning is corroborated by Father José Agapito Mateo Minos in Nohualco Tlalpixtican (1722), about how he saw the maceration and decanting tanks of the xoxouki plant, when it still existed in the plaza Zacate. Ángela Peralta mentions a unique pyramid consisting of three parts: the momozok, the turret and the campanile (tower), demolished by the colonial government. Remnants of this can be seen in the staircase of the municipal palace.Jojutla has an area of 143 km2 (55.2 miles2), representing 2.88% of the state. It is located at 890 meters (2,920 ft.) above sea level. The municipality reported 57,121 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.Lake Tequesquitengo and part of the Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve are located in the municipality of Jojutla.


== History ==


=== Prehispanic History ===
The area that is Jojutla today was covered by the internal Sea of Plancarte in the Paleozoic Era. The first inhabitants are believed to have arrived 22,000 years ago. Although fragments of obsidian, ceramic, and pottery have been found in the atriums of the chapels of Teocalzingo, Guadalupe, and Tlatenchi, no serious archaeological studies have been undertaken in the area. The Codex Mendoza tells us that people lived in Jojutla from 1425-1436 CE, when they were conquered by the troops of Izcóatl and Nezahualcóyotl, and submitted to the Calpixca Acolhua of Tlaquiltenango and the lordship of Cuauhnáhuac.


=== Colonial Era ===
The exact date when the Spanish arrived is unclear, but the establishment of the town of San Miguel Xoxutla suggests they arrived on September 29 of 1522 or 1523, considering that in 1524 they inaugurated the bridge and dam of Cuernavaquita in Tlaquiltenango under orders from Hernan Cortes. The area was governed by Tlaquiltenango, particularly after the arrival of the religious orders in 1549 and 1604.The area around Xoxutla was quite swampy, so agriculture was not very profitable. The principal economic activities were fishing, production of indigo dye, and basketry.As the population increased, a Sunday market developed in the Plaza de Arriba (atrium the church of San Miguel). The opening of the Acapulco-México trade route in the 17th century and the bridge of Our Lady of Guadalupe over the Apatlaco River on July 16, 1616, encouraged the growth of the market.One confusing fact as to the date of foundation of Jojutla is that 18 families headed by Ignacio de la Luz fled from Chimalacatlan because of an epidemic. The Dominican friars of the Villa de Tlaquiltenango accepted them in the town of San Jerónimo Metl, on April 14, 1695. Incidentally, this confusion in part comes from Dr. Santos Amador Espinoza, who wrote Notes on the history of the City of Jojutla de Juárez in 1895, but whose information was later contradicted by Father José Agapito Mateo Minos Campuzano. The town of San Jerónimo Metl itself was devastated by a cholera epidemic in May 1770.On September 14, 1722, in hacienda of San Gabriel, the muleteer José Cerón found an image of the crucified Christ, which was taken to the chapel of the hacienda, only to mysteriously disappear three times. The Dominican friars then took it their monastery in Tlaquiltenango  on January 1, 1723, when it again disappeared, only to reappear on the main altar of the chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe, of the town of Archangel San Miguel Xoxutla. Since that time, there has been a festival in Xoxutla (Jojutla).


=== Independence & 19th century ===
During the War of Mexican Independence Juan Antonio Tlaxcoapan of Tlaquiltenango led a group of citizens to meet Generals Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo in Chimalacatlan on September 8, 1813. The citizens of Jojutla did not join the Insurgents in Chilpancingo, and once their army withdrew Tlaxcoapan was taken prisoner and shot by Spanish authorities on November 6, 1813. Today he is recognized as a local hero.Ricardo Sánchez moved to Jojutla on March 15, 1830, and in 1836 he introduced the cultivation of brown rice. Sánchez lobbied for the municipalization of the town of the Archangel San Miguel Xoxutla, which was granted by the government of the State of Mexico on March 29, 1847. Sánchez became the first municipal president and he rescheduled the feast of the Lord of Tula from September 14 to January 1.The Jojutla Railway began on September 21, 1890.On April 14, 1895, at the initiative of a group led by the priest Agapito Mateo Minos Campuzano, Jojutla celebrated its bicentennial.


=== Revolution & 20th century ===

There are hotels around the lake in all price categories.Teques is a popular weekend destination for Mexicans from the capital and the State of Morelos.The lake has a tragic history. The general belief is that the village of Tequesquitengo was flooded by the Mosso brothers, who—according to Alfonso Toussaint—owned the San José Vista Hermosa hacienda in the mid-19th century, which was erected during the colonial era in the upper part of the valley. Newspapers of the nineteenth century pointed out that in the northern part of the valley there was a small lagoon, which was sustenance for the colonial town of Tequesquitengo, in addition to the tequesquite, a mineral from which the settlement took its name. Until a difference between the peasants and the hacendados caused the latter to divert the flow of surplus water from the irrigation channels of the hacienda to the valley, flooding it and forcing its settlers to settle on the shores of the lake that formed covering the town and its church, San Juan Bautista.Scholars differ about when the flooding began, suggesting dates between 1820 and 1880, with some blaming the earthquake of 1845.
