== Etymology ==
The county took its name because it is located to the east of Rugao County and was once part of it. The ancient name of it was Fuhaizhou, which meant a small sand island in the ocean.


== Demographics and languages ==
The county has many extraneous people from the south of the Yangtse River (Changjiang River), so there are two main dialects: Rudonghua which is a branch of Jianghuai Mandarin and Shadihua (Wu: Sodiwo [so di ɯo]), which is a branch of the Wu language.


== Economy ==
Rudong is located on the bank of the Yellow Sea. As a result, there is a sizable fishing industry and the county was named "the place of seafood in China" by the Chinese Cooking Association in 2007. Rudong also contains a harbor for commercial cargo. Yankou Harbor was launched in May 2011 and includes a facility for unloading liquified natural gas. In addition, there is a wind farm near Rudong's sea bank. The farm contained 217 turbines as of 2009, making it the largest in the country in its grade.
