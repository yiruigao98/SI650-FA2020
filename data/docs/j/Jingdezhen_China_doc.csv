Jingdezhen is a prefecture-level city, in northeastern Jiangxi province, with a total population of 1,669,057 (2018), bordering Anhui to the north. It is known as the "Porcelain Capital" because it has been producing Chinese ceramics for at least 1,000 years, and for much of that period Jingdezhen porcelain was the most important and finest quality in China.  The city has a well-documented history that stretches back over 2,000 years.


== History ==
Throughout both the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the area of present-day Jingdezhen belonged to the Chu State. After the fall of the Chu, the area was incorporated into the Qin Dynasty as part of Fan County (番县) in Jiujiang Commandery. Under the Han Dynasty, the area belonged to Poyang County (鄱阳县) in Yuzhang Commandery. Under the Han Dynasty, the particular area of future Jingdezhen was known as Xinping (新平). Historical records show that it was during this time that it began to make porcelain.The town was established during the Jin Dynasty under the name Changnan (昌南), due to its location on the south bank of the Chang river. The town's name would be changed twice, first in 742 CE to Fuliang (浮梁), and then in 1004 to Jingdezhen, its current name, after the era name of the Emperor Zhenzong during whose reign its porcelain production first rose to fame. The town was placed under the jurisdiction of Fuliang County.In the Ming and Qing dynasties, Jingdezhen was considered one of China's four great towns in terms of commercial and industrial importance. The others were Foshan in Guangdong, Hankou in Hubei, and Zhuxian in Henan.In 1855 during the Taiping Rebellion, Taiping forces destroyed all 9,000 kilns in Jingdezhen. They would be rebuilt after the war in 1866.In the 19th century, Jingdezhen became a county.On April 29, 1949, Communist forces took the city. During the period of the People's Republic of China it became a provincial city but retained the Jingdezhen name.  Usually when a town is upgraded to a city, the designation of "city" replaces that of "town", but Jingdezhen retained its name to honor its history.In 1960, Fuliang County was merged into the city.Jingdezhen was named one of top 24 national historical and cultural cities of the People's Republic of China on February 28, 1982.In July 1983, Leping County was also merged into the city. In October 1988, Fuliang County was re-established, and in September 1992, Leping County was re-established as a county-level city.In 2004, Jingdezhen celebrated the millennium of its becoming the porcelain capital and its assuming its present name.

== Porcelain ==

Jingdezhen may have produced pottery as early as the sixth century CE, though it is named after the reign name of Emperor Zhenzong, in whose reign it became a major kiln site, around 1004. By the 14th century it had become the largest centre of production of Chinese porcelain, which it has remained, increasing its dominance in subsequent centuries.  For several centuries, almost all top quality Chinese porcelain has come from the town.  From the Ming period onwards, official kilns in Jingdezhen were controlled by the emperor, making "imperial porcelain" in large quantity for the court and the emperor to give as gifts.
Although apparently an unpromising location for potteries, being a remote town in a hilly region, Jingdezhen is close to the best quality deposits of petuntse, or porcelain stone, in China, as well as being surrounded by forests, mostly of pine, providing wood for the kilns. It also has a river leading to river systems flowing north and south, facilitating transport of fragile wares.  The imperial kilns were in the centre of the city at Zhushan (Pearl Hill), with many other kilns four kilometres away at Hutian.It has produced a great variety of pottery and porcelain, for the Chinese market and as Chinese export porcelain, but its best-known high quality porcelain wares have been successively Qingbai ware in the Song and Yuan dynasties, blue and white porcelain from the 1330s, and the "famille rose" and other "famille" colours under the Qing dynasty.  The town continues to produce cheaper tablewares in great quantity, as well as more expensive decorative pieces.  During the Cultural Revolution, Jingdezhen produced a large number of porcelain Mao badges and statues of a seated Mao Zedong.
Jingdezhen porcelain has fetched record prices at auctions, with a blue and white porcelain jar produced during the Yuan Dynasty auctioning for $27.7 million in London in 2005, and a porcelain cup produced during the Ming Dynasty auctioning for $36.3 million in 2014.
