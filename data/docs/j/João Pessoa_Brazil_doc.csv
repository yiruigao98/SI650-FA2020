Alvarenga Shipwreck : It is a type of vessel that was used to transport supplies to ships and wrecked 6 miles from the tip of Bessa's beach, 20 meters deep. It remains whole measuring 20 meters in length by 5 meters in the mouth. It is possible to penetrate the small bow and stern compartments safely. On the prow we can still see the winch that picked up the anchor. It is also common to find large stingrays and large shoals of fish, such as the top cock and the hook.
Burnt Shipwreck : The Erie J.N.Y is an American steam of 2,000 tons. He had left Rio de Janeiro with 24,900 bags of coffee destined for the United States. On January 2, 1873, at 2 am, it caught fire and sank (so it was known as "Burned"). Passengers and crew were saved.
Wreck Alice: Alice is a Brazilian steam which was built in 1866 and measured 53 meters long by 6.6 meters. He was chartered by the government to transport Brazilian troops in the Paraguayan war. On March 30, 1869, Prince Emperor Gaston d'Orleans (Count d'Eu) took his place to take command of the Brazilian Army; Alice was shipwrecked in 1911.Today it is 3.5 miles from the tip of Bessa beach and is 12 meters deep.
