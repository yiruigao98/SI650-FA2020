== Etymology ==
Jaynagar is an ancient settlement. The name of Jaynagar comes from the name of the local goddess Joychandi, from which the town derived the name, Joychanditala. Over time it became Joychandinagar and then Joynagar or Jaynagar.Another ancient settlement is Majilpur. The etymology of the name is an interesting one. Originally the Ganges would flow over where the town is, but slowly it started silting down. This silting is called Moje Jaoa in Bengali language, from which the town derived the name, Mojapur. Over time it became Mojpur, Mojipur and then Mojilpur or Majilpur.


== History ==
Many janapadas grew up along the old Bhagirathi channel from the ancient times till around the 16th century: Kalighat, Boral, Rajpur, Harinavi, Mahinagar, Baruipur, Baharu, Jaynagar, Majilpur, Chhatrabhog etc. Bipradas Pipilai's Manasavijaya, composed in 1495, mentions many places in this region. "Chand Sadagar, a merchant character of the Manasavijaya, reached Baruipur, from Kalighat, through the old Bhagirathi channel. From there he proceeded towards Chhatrabhog, and then traveling through Hatiagarh pargana reached the open sea". Chaitanyadeva (1486–1534) also went through this route. Travelling by boat to Puri he halted at the village of Atisara, near Baruipur. "His last stoppage in 24 Parganas was at Chhatrabhog, now a village within the jurisdiction of the Mathurapur police station. Chhatrabhog seems to have been an important river-port on the old Bhagirathi channel". Rama Chandra Khan, the zamindar of Chhatrabhog, helped Chaitanyadeva to continue with his journey.The city of Jaynagar Majilpur carries the memory of a very significant incident in the history of the Bengal. When Raja Pratapaditya Roy, the last independent Hindu king of Bengal at Jessore was defeated by the Mughal forces, the State Diwan's (Grand vizier) family and the State Priest's family were forced to flee to avoid persecution and conversion. They settled down in the city to form the estate of the Duttas, and the Brahmin priest, Sree Krishna Udgata, who came over, settled down in what is today the Bhattacharya Para. All the Bhattacharyas in the city are his scions, with the current 13th generation being settled out of the city.The city is famous for the ancient Dhanwantary Kali Temple, believed to be very benevolent, who listens to the prayers of her devotees promptly. An annual event is held, called the Besher Mela, where the goddess Kali is dressed up as Radha Krishna and other goddesses. It attracts thousands of devotees, and is one of the most iconic yearly events in the city. Also, by the express direction of the Dhanwantary Kali, every year, during Kali Puja, it is mandatory to host a Kali Puja in every Brahmin household of the city. It used to be a big annual festival, with hundreds of houses performing Kali Puja on the night of the Diwali, and going out on the next day in a beautifully orchestrated procession, going around the city, before the immersion or the Bisarjan. However, over the past few years, the number of houses performing Kali Puja has fallen drastically, now performed in only twenty odd houses. This has been mainly due to the gradual outward immigration of people from the hamlet, the reluctancy of the younger generation, and their inability to get hold of funds considering the deteriorating economic condition of Bengal, the rise of public subscription or locally called Barowari Puja and also the rise of Muslim immigrants and converts, who have posed problems while the peaceful immersion procession was on its way.The city was also called Half-Calcutta owing to the development it had seen before independence, with stalwarts like Sivanath Sastri and Umesh Chandra Dutta emerging. It was also a centre for active freedom fighting, with names like Kanailal Bhattacharya and Rajaram Bhattacharya to name a few.
