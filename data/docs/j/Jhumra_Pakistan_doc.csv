Chak Jhumra  (Urdu: چک جُھمرہ‎), is a town, railway junction, and tehsil in Punjab, Pakistan. The town is situated about 21 kilometres (13 mi) Northeast of Faisalabad on Faisalabad-Sangla Hill Road. The Khanewal–Wazirabad Branch and Sangla Hill–Kundian Branch intersect in the town and connect it to Faisalabad and Sargodha respectively.
Prior to the establishment of Pakistan, the town was known as a hub of the cotton trade. At the time, three cotton grinding factories operated within the town. Following the Partition of India, the town's Hindu population, of which the majority of traders were a part of, immigrated to India, causing business to decline significantly.
Beginning in the 1960s, the town began to again experience economic growth and development of infrastructure. At this time a number of schools, hospitals, and textile factories were constructed within the town.
Today, textile manufacturing is the dominant industry within Chak Jhumra.
