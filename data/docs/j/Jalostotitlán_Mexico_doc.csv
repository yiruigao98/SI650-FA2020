== Etymology ==

The name "Jalostotitlán" is a Spanish rendering of the Nahuatl toponym Xālōztōtitlān, a locative which can be loosely translated as "place of sandy caves", or more accurately, "in the place of caves of sand" (from xālli "sand" and ōztōtl "cave"), referring to caves with sandy deposits from which sand was extracted.


== History ==
In 1164, the residents of the area (mostly from the Tecuexe and Caxcan tribes) resisted Aztec advances, who had just settled in nearby Teocaltiche for a period of 40 years before moving on to Tenochtitlán.
The Spaniards first arrived in the area during the conquest of Tonalá under Captain Pedro Almíndez Chirino with the 350 Spaniards and 500 Purépecha and Tlaxcaltecs under his control.
After a series of rebellions, the area was placed under the Spanish crown in 1541. The town of Jalostotitlán was founded by Fray Miguel de Bologna in 1544.
After the Mexican War of Independence, Jalostotitlán gained the status of a town in 1838. The municipality of Jalostotitlán was created on 21 May 1872.
Jalostotitlan is the location of sites associated with canonized Mexican Catholic priests Toribio Romo Gonzalez and Pedro Esqueda Ramírez, who were murdered by federal troops during the Cristero War or La Cristiada
Jalostotitlán was elevated to city status on 1 September 1970 and made the seat of the municipality.
Jalostotitlán is the birthplace of famed General José María González de Hermosillo, who fought in the Mexican War of Independence. The city of Hermosillo, Sonora is named in his honor.
It is also the birthplace of famed poet Alfredo R. Plascencia Jáuregui.
