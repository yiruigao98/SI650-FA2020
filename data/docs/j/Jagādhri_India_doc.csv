Jagadhri is a city and a municipal council in the Yamunanagar district of the Indian state of Haryana. This town lies adjacent to the city of Yamunanagar. The demarcation line between the two is difficult to discern. Jagadhri is around 100 km away from Chandigarh, the capital city of Haryana state. 


== Etymology ==
Jagadhri, corrupted form of its old name Yugandhari, was  named after the king of the Yugandharas. Yugandharas find mention in Mahabharata as well as Buddhist texts as region with warriors or mountains. Yugandhara likely was used for a region  inhabited by a tribe of that name and it comprised some mountainous tracts also which were given the same name.


== History ==
Excavations have found the punch marked square coins, a Greek hemidrachm coin of Indo-Greek king Apollodotus I or Apollodotus II (1st and 2nd century BCE ) and one of Antimachus I/Antimachus II (2nd century BCE), a gold coin  of Samudragupta (ruled 336-380 CE) and other coins of the period up to the Prithviraj Chauhan and Tomara dynasty kings of Delhi. It was likely the capital city of a Janapada.
There are few places which have signs of Ashoka like Topra kalan, Chaneti, Sugh and Lohgarh. Topra kalan is the place where the Ashoka pillar having Pali inscriptions was originally installed by Ashoka. This pillar was uprooted by Mughal invader Ferozeshah Tughlaq and was moved to Delhi and reinstalled. Chaneti has one full size Buddhist stupa excavated similar to those found in saanchi and sarnath. Sugh also had signs of Buddhism which have been razed by local natives. Lohgarh is the place where Banda Singh Bahadur established the first Sikh capital of the world and the Sikh kingdom coins were also minted here.
The town was known historically for its metal work and brass ware including utensils. Nowadays production of brass ware has fallen off, due to high costs and the city has successfully transitioned to the manufacture of aluminium and stainless steel products. Moreover, Jagadhri has also witnessed the growth of a new timber trade in the last decade.There are many old temples, such as LathMar Mandir, Khera Mandir, Gauri Shankar Mandir and Guga Madi Mandir, Devi Mandir (Mansa Devi).
