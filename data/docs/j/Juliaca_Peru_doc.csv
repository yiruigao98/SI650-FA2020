Juliaca's citizens rely on cars, trains, and bicycles. It is a major transit point in the region and has strong ties with Peru's southern cities, including Arequipa, Puno, Tacna, Cuzco, Ilo, and with La Rinconada and Bolivia.
Like Chicago, Illinois, it is nicknamed "The Windy City", because of the city's location on the windy Collao Plateau. It is also called the "Sock City" or "Knitting City" because Juliaca was a major center of sock, sweater, and handicraft production. Now the production of clothes, wool and fabrics are industrial processes.

It is also home to Inca Manco Capac Airport, the region's main airport.


== Etymology ==
The historian Ramon Rios argues that Juliaca comes from the Quechua words Xullaskca kaipi (it had drizzled) in allusion that when the Inca troops arrived at this part of the Altiplano chasing the collas, they noticed that in the Huaynarroque hill it had drizzled.
However, Justo Ruelas affirms that Juliaca comes from the Quechua word Shulla Qaqa (roquedal dew), due to the fact that in the vicinity of the Huaynarroque and Santa Cruz hills, small quartz particles can be seen, which resembles the morning dew that falls on rocks.


== History ==


=== Pre-Spanish arrival ===
The Altiplano was inhabited from around 4,000 BC by sedentary communities dedicated to agriculture and livestock (llamas and guinea pigs).
The Uros settled in the river towns, taking advantage of the benefits of the totora and the fish of Lake Titicaca, settled in the surrounding lakes: Chacas, Qoriwata, Cochapampa, and the Juliaca River, today Coata River.

"The Indians who are called Uros...live on the banks where they fish, with which they support themselves...they are strong Indians and of good disposition and there are many who are in the lakes without making sementeras or clothes, eating from roots that they call totora."
The constitution of these settlers were registered as Uros de Coata and Uros de Desaguadero, from where the Uros of Coata would be better communicated and related to Juliaca, by the river that linked them, also these riverine settlers developed a sailing technique, on rafts made of totora, fastened with yarned ropes based on the ichus, which would serve as support for fishing, and at times, of transport from Lake Titicaca to the smaller lakes that were between the territories of Juliaca.

"As a testimony of the ancient presence of the Uros, in the balsero partiality, and later in the rafts of Juliaca, there have been some names of places: Totoral, Torococha..."
Between the years 1000 to 500 BC, Juliaca flourished under the influence of Qaluyo (ancient settlement), in the place of Qomer Moqo (Taparachi). Archaeologists discovered a small village dating back to this time, whose settlers were fed with potatoes, quinoa, kañiwa, carachi, guinea pig, among others. They were the first builders of waruwarus and developed a special textile industry.
In the years 200 BC to 200 AD, the domain of the Pukara culture expanded in this region of the highlands. Between the third and fourth centuries, the Huaynarroque tribe flourished. Subsequently, the hegemony of Tiahuanaco, Colla and Inka arises consecutively. The kollas and Inka were ruthless rivals and only under the military command of Pachacútec and his son Mayta Capac were able to subdue the brave Sapana, Chuchicápac and Huaynarroque tribes after bloody wars of conquest.
