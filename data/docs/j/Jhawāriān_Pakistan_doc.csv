The M-2 was conceived by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his first term(1990–1993) and later inaugurated on November 26, 1997, during his second term. In late 2006, upgrades were made to the portion of the M-2 passing through the Salt Ranges due to increasing complaints of drivers. The upgrades included better marking of the road lines and increased size of road signs for easy visibility.
In 2016 M2 got completely new carpeting for a smooth and safer drive.
