In ancient times Jalore was known as Jabalipura - named after the Hindu saint Jabali. The town was also known as Suvarngiri or Songir, the Golden Mount, on which the fort stands. It was a flourishing town in the 8th century, and, according to some historical sources, in the 8th-9th centuries, one branch of the Gurjara-Pratihara ruled at Jablipur (Jalore).In the 10th century, Jalore was ruled by the Paramaras. In 1181, Kirtipala, the youngest son of Alhana, the Chahamana ruler of Nadol, captured Jalore from the Paramaras and founded the Jalore line of Chauhans. His son Samarasimha succeeded him in 1182. Samarasimha was succeeded by Udayasimha, who expanded the kingdom by recapturing Nadol and Mandor from the Turks. During Udayasimha's reign, Jalore was a tributary of the Delhi Sultanate.. Udayasimha was succeeded by Chachigadeva and Samantasimha. Samantasimha was succeeded by his son Kanhadadeva.
During the reign of Kanhadadeva, Jalor was attacked and captured in 1311 by the Delhi's Turkic Sultan Alauddin Khalji. Kanhadadeva and his son Viramadeva died defending Jalore.
