Jhang  (Punjabi and Urdu: جھنگ‎) is the capital city of Jhang District, in the central portion of the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Situated on the east bank of the Chenab river, it is the 18th largest city of Pakistan by population.The historical name of the city and district is Jhang Sial. The word Jhang is derived from the Sanskrit word jāṅgala which means rough or arid terrain, the word Jungle also sharing the same root. In context, Jhang was therefore known after its chief inhabitants and rulers, the Sials. The name Jhang Sial literally meaning, 'the terrain of the Sials'.The locality also includes the Shrine (Darbar) of Pir Abdul Rehman (R.A) shrine of Sultan Bahu and Heer and Ranjha's Tomb.


== History ==

The history of Jhang is the history of the Sial tribe.Jhang was built in 1288 by Maharaja Rai Sial, a Rajput chief and founder of the Sial Tribe. The Sial tribe, his kin, ruled this district ever since until the last Sial ruler of Jhang, Ahmad Khan (1812 to 1822) was defeated by Ranjit Singh after fierce fighting.Under the collective rule of the Sial Khans of Jhang and other Sial Sub-Tribes such as the Rajbana and Bharwana, in the zenith of their power, the Sial country of Jhang extended up to the Muzafargarh boundary in the south, and the entirety of Chiniot, Kamalia and Kabirwala ilakas.  The territory extended to parts of Bhakkar and Sargodha. The Garh Mahraja and Ahmadpur Sial ilakas were added to the possessions of the Rajbana Sial tribe who drove out the Baloch tribes to the Thal and defeated the Nawab of Multan by the mid 17th century.Under the British Raj, the towns of Jhang and Mighiana, lying two miles (3.2 km) apart, became a joint municipality, then known as Jhang-Maghiana.Maghiana lies on the edge of the highlands, overlooking the alluvial valley of the Chenab, while the older town of Jhang occupies the lowlands at its foot.
