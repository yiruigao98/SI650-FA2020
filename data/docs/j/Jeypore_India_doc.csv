King Veer Vikram Dev left Nandapur and settled in a valley lying south of their kingdom and named it 'Jeypore' or 'city of victory'. Later, his grandson Vishwambhar Dev established a feudal system and expanded his kingdom till Srikakulam in the east and introduced many feudatories that paid homage to his seat. He stopped the slave trade of the Dutch East India Company and was popular as 'Sumber Deo' among the Dutch which was a mispronounced form of his name.
In 1710, Maharajah Ram Chandra Deo and his younger brother Balaram Dev (III) had a personal feud that led to the downfall of the kingdom. The problems arose because of minister Viziaram Raz who was planning to usurp the throne from the weak ruler. Although Balaram remonstrated Viziaram Raz in the court he was favored by Ram Chandra who heavily relied on him.
In 2013, Vishweshvar Dev was crowned as the titular ruler of Jeypore becoming the twenty-seventh ruler on the 570th anniversary of his dynasty.
