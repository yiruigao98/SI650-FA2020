== History ==
Under the names "Makr Harsin" and "al-Hudeidah", Makr and Jadeidi, respectively, were mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders during the hudna (truce agreement) of 1283 between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur Qalawun.  However, it is also possible that Makr Harsin in the original text referred to separate locations Makr and Harsini, the latter unidentified.

He further noted that "In and about El Mekr are broken columns, the fragment of an ancient bas-relief, a little sarcophagus in terra cotta, and several sepulchral caves." He found Jadeidi to have 350 inhabitants.In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Jadeidi as "a village, built of stone, containing about eighty Moslems and twenty Christians, surrounded by olives and arable land, situated near the plain, .....with many cisterns for rain water to drink from." Makr was described as "a village, built of stone, containing 100 Moslems and eighty Christians, situated at the edge of the plain, surrounded by olives and arable land; there are many cisterns for rain-water in the village."A population list from about 1887 showed that Jadeidi had about 245 inhabitants; half Muslim and half Greek Christians, while Makr had 280 inhabitants; one third Catholic and Greek Christians, two thirds Muslim.
