Jarabacoa is a town and the second largest municipality in La Vega Province, Dominican Republic.


== History ==
The natives of the island inhabited the valley of Jarabacoa. It is assumed that the city's name was formed out of the words 'Jaraba' and 'Coa', meaning "Land of Waters" in the native language. Some say that the Spanish conquistadors actually made it to Jarabacoa in their search for gold, but later abandoned the expedition. Some reasons include, resistance by the natives or as some say, because no large finds were ever made, although to this day gold can be washed from some of the many rivers.Jarabacoa most likely belonged to the Chiefdom of Maguana making it part of the kingdom of Cibao. Necessary archaeological work has yet to take place, but it can be assumed that the natives lived in the area long before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. It wasn't until 1805 that the area began being re-populated, during the Haitian invasion of the Cibao, when survivors from the massacres of Santiago de los Caballeros and La Vega escaped to the mountains of the Central Range and settled in the valley of Jarabacoa. In 1854, a military post was established and the town was formally founded. On September 27, 1858 the town was incorporated as a municipality.
