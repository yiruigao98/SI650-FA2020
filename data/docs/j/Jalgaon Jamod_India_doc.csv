Jalgaon Jamod is a town in Buldhana district, in the Indian state of Maharashtra.


== History ==
The name Jalgaon is a combination of two Marathi words, Jal and Gaon, that mean village of water. This name came because of heavy water resources around the town. The name 'Jalgaon Jamod' developed because of a small village called 'Jamod' near to Jalgaon. The name 'Jamod' was given by Mughal emperors after 1630 AD, when Mughal emperor Shahjahan's wife Mumtaz Mahal was traveling with Shah Jahan's earlier military campaigns. She started facing pregnancy complications in Jamod which led to death in the city of Burhanpur near Jalgaon Jamod. After this incident Mughals started calling the village Ja-e-Maut (Place of Death). Ja-e-Maut was a Persian word later called Ja-maut, Ja-mod or Jamod by locals.
