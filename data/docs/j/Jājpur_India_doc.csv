Jajpur (also known as Jajapur) is a city and a municipality in Jajpur district in the Indian state of Odisha. It was the capital of the Kesari dynasty, later supplanted by Cuttack. Now, it is the headquarter of Jajpur district.


== Etymology and names ==
Jajpur, the place of the ancient Biraja Temple, was originally known as Biraja. Other names of the city in the ancient texts include Viranja, Varanja-nagara, Varaha-tirtha. The Bhauma-Kara kings established their capital city of Guhadevapataka (or Guheshvarapataka), identified with modern Gohiratikar (or Gohiratikra) near Jajpur. The later Somavanshi kings moved their capital from Yayatinagara (modern Binka) to Guheshvarapataka, and renamed the city Abhinava-Yayatinagara ("the new city of Yayati").Later, the Jajpur city came to be known as Yajanagara. According to one theory, this name is a corruption of "Yayatinagara". Another theory is that it derives from the Brahmanical sacrifices (Yajna) that became popular during the Ganga-Gajapati period (11th-16th century). In the Muslim chronicles such as Tabaqat-i-Nasiri and Tarikh-i-Firuzshahi, the city's name was mentioned as "Jajnagar". Later, the suffix "-nagar" ("city") was replaced with the equivalent "-pur", and the city's name became "Jajpur".
