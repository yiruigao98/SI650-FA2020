== Toponymy ==
The name of Joué-lès-Tours appears in its form "Gaudiacus" in the 6th Century. It corresponds to a toponymic type frequently found in Christian Gaule, that gave different variants depending on the region: Joué (west of France), Jouy (center and north), Jouey (east), Gouy (Normandy/Picardy), Gaugeac, Jaujac (south). It is composed of the Christian name "Gaudius", meaning "fortunate", "blessed" (gaudia > joy, in Latin) and with the Gallo-Roman suffix -ACU, meaning "place of", "property of".


== History ==
Joué-lès-Tours was the site of the 20 December 2014 Tours police station stabbing.


== Controversy ==
In February 2010 the mayor, Philippe Le Breton, added the word laïcité underneath the French national motto on the town hall's façade. The Muslim community of Joué-lès-Tours felt they were being "caricatured".
