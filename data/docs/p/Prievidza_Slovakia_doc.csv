Prievidza (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈpɾɪ̯ɛʋidza] (listen); Hungarian: Privigye, German: Priwitz) is a city in the central-western Slovakia. With approximately 46,000 inhabitants it is the second biggest municipality in the Trenčín Region and 11th largest city in Slovakia generally.


== Name ==
The name is probably deduced from a personal name Previd with possessive sufix -ja (Previd's village). An alternative and less probable is a derivation from vid- (Slovak: vidieť – to see, "previdieť" – to see through), thus "the village which can be seen from all directions", "the village in the thin stand".


== Features ==
As a central city of Prievidza District and Upper Nitra Basin (Horná Nitra in Slovak) Prievidza is a seat for many institutions of regional importance – governmental as well as commercial. Because of relatively high percentage of planted trees, Prievidza is commonly called as the "green city".
Prievidza has 6 boroughs: Staré mesto (Old Town in English), Píly, Necpaly, Kopanice, Zápotôčky and Žabník  and there are three adjoining villages that are an administrative part of Prievidza: Hradec, Malá Lehôtka and Veľká Lehôtka.


== History ==


=== The oldest settlement ===
The Upper Nitra Basin was inhabited as early as the middle of the Paleolithic period, as evidenced by the rich paleontological findings in Bojnice and Prievidza. Thousands of artifacts have been discovered, including stone tools, animal bone fossils and fireplace remnants.


=== The Middle Ages ===
The first written mention of Prievidza was in 1113, as ‘'Preuigan'’. It was promoted to a royal free town in 1383, on 26 January. This meant that the town obtained privileges such as paying benefits to hold markets, choice of pastor and mayor, building mills, catching fish, the free development of crafts and sale of produce. From the 16th to the first third of the 17th century, the Thurzó family controlled the town. Ottomans approached Prievidza from the south and burned it in 1599, along with other towns in the upper Nitra river valley. In 1666, the Piarists built the baroque church (now known as the Piarist Church) and Monastery, which became a centre of culture and education. During the Kuruc uprising in 1673, Prievidza was burned down again, with fire burning a part of town's archives. In 1870, it had 2,719 inhabitants. Since the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, industry started to grow, as the railways to Prievidza were constructed. During World War II, the city was one of the centres of partisans. On 4 April 1945, Prievidza was captured by troops of the Soviet 40th Army. Since the end of the war, the population has grown enormously from 5,000 inhabitants to around 53,000 inhabitants, as industry grew.
