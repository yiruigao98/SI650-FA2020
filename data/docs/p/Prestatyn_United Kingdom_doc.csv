== History ==


=== Prehistory ===
There is evidence that the current town location has been occupied since prehistoric times. Prehistoric tools found in the caves of Graig Fawr, in the nearby village of Meliden, have revealed the existence of early human habitation in the area.


=== Roman ===
The Roman bathhouse is believed to be part of a fort on the road from Chester to Caernarfon. However, much of "Roman Prestatyn" has been destroyed as houses have been built over unexcavated land.


=== Medieval ===
The name Prestatyn derives from the Old English preosta ("priest") and tun ("town"), and was recorded in the Domesday Book as Prestetone. Unlike similarly derived names in England, which generally lost their penultimate syllable and became Preston, this village's name developed a typically Welsh emphasis on the penultimate syllable and a modification of "ton" to "tyn", as also happened at Mostyn.
Although the Domesday Book only extended to demesnes in England, Prestatyn was included since it was at that time under English control.
An earth mound, visible in fields to the east of the railway station, beyond Nant Hall, marks the site of an early wooden Prestatyn castle, probably built by the Norman Robert de Banastre about 1157, which was destroyed by the Welsh under Owain Gwynedd in 1167. The Banastre family then moved to Bank Hall in Lancashire.
The town appears to have been primarily a fishing village for hundreds of years. The beginning and end of High Street today mark the location of two 'maenolau' (or manor houses) called Pendre (translated as "end of" or "top of town") and Penisadre ("lower end of town").


=== 19th century to present ===
The town's population remained at less than 1,000 until the arrival of the railways and the holidaymakers in the 19th and 20th centuries. "Sunny Prestatyn" became famous for its beach, clean seas and promenade entertainers, and visiting for a bathe was considered very healthy by city-dwelling Victorians. During the Second World War the holiday camps were used as billets for British soldiers, many of whom were also sent to live with locals.
Prestatyn was the home of the first UK Kwik Save supermarket in 1965; Prestatyn was also the home of the firm's business headquarters. The Kwik Save store was renamed Somerfield following a takeover in 2007, and was finally demolished in 2008 when surrounding land was bought by Tesco.
The North Hoyle Offshore Wind Farm was opened in 2003. Situated in Liverpool Bay, 5 miles (8 km) off the coast of Prestatyn, it was the UK's first major offshore wind farm. It has 30 wind turbines with a combined maximum capacity of 60 megawatts - enough to power 40,000 homes.


== Facilities and attractions ==
Although Prestatyn remains a tourist destination and resort town, the town is diversifying in response to the decline of the British seaside holiday.
The town is at the northern end of the Offa's Dyke Path, although not on Offa's Dyke itself. It also marks the eastern end of the North Wales Path, a long-distance coastal route to Bangor, and the western end of the Clwydian Way. Other attractions include the remains of Roman baths and the nearby Neolithic mound, the Gop.
Pontin's Holiday Centre was the location for a 1973 film of the popular British TV series, On the Buses.


== Politics ==
The town was in the Delyn parliamentary constituency from 1983 to 1997, since when it has been in Vale of Clwyd.
For elections to Denbighshire County Council the town is divided into five electoral wards, namely Prestatyn Central, Prestatyn East, Prestatyn Meliden, Prestatyn North and Prestatyn South West.For elections to Prestatyn Town Council the town is divided into six wards (with Prestatyn North county ward being subdivided into North and North West). Eighteen town councillors are elected.

The traditional Carnival Parade takes place on the Saturday, and is followed by a Carnival Baby Competition later in the day. In 2008 the carnival became a two-day event, with the Sunday designated "Fun on the Field" day, with many events including a talent show and dance competition. In 2011 the event reverted to its original oneâ€“day format.In 2008, Prestatyn Carnival Association revived the Miss Prestatyn title.

Philip Larkin wrote a poem entitled Sunny Prestatyn. In it he describes a poster advertising the resort that is progressively defaced by vulgar graffiti. Roddy Frame and Jeremy Stacey wrote most of Aztec Camera's 1995 album Frestonia during a three-week retreat at the Sands Hotel in Prestatyn. Frame later blamed the overcast and grim weather conditions there for the album's melancholy and gloomy tone.The town also appears in The Royle Family 2009 Christmas special "The Golden Egg Cup", in which the family visits Prestatyn to celebrate Jim and Barb's fiftieth wedding anniversary.
