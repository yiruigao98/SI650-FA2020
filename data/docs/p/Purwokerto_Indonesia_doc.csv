== History ==
The history of Purwokerto as the capital of the Banyumas Regency is intertwined with the history of Banyumas itself.  Banyumas was established in 1582 by Raden Joko Kahiman. He later became the first regent, Duke Mrapat.


=== The Sultanate of Pajang ===
Following the unintentional killing of Adipati Wirasaba VI in District Lowano (now Purworejo), Sultan Hadiwijaya summoned Joko Kahiman, the dead man's son in law. The Sultan made Kahiman "Adipati Wirasaba VII" (Regent of Wirasaba) and divided the Wirasaba regency into four parts. The Banjar region was given to Kyai Ngabei Wirayuda. The Meden territory was given to Kyai Ngabei Wirakusuma. The Wirasaba territory given to Kyai Ngabei Wargawijaya and the Kejawar territory was controlled by the Sultan himself. There, he cleared the Mangli forest and named the area "Banyumas". At that time, the capital of the Kejawar territory was in Banyumas. After the flood of 1861, the capital was moved to Purwokerto, which was located about 18 km further north.

Purwokerto's nearest airport is the Tunggul Wulung airport in Cilacap township, approximately 40 km south of Purwokerto. Tunggul Wulung has direct flights (three times per week) from Halim Perdana Kusuma airport in Jakarta.  The travel time from Jakarta to Cilacap is 45 minutes. Lately in 2016 Wirasaba (PWL) is planned for commercial flight service. The distance to the town is about 15 km only. Many news states which this airport will be developed for commercial flight even Garuda Indonesia and Susi Air will be serving this route to Jakarta. Additionally, there's a new bridge has been built by 2 regencies between Banyumas and Purbalingga called Linggamas which supports it.

All classes of the ticket, from economy to first class, are available for trips on trains from Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, and Surabaya. The total journey from Jakarta is 6 hrs (first class) and 10 hrs (economy class). Soon in 2016, is being built double track between Purwokerto and Kroya for about 25 km the distance. It will be easier also faster the trip between two station above. Double track from Jakarta to Purwokerto now is fully serviced and it takes 5 hours only for single trip.

The Bulupitu's bus station services the passengers across the mainland to Bali/Lombok in the eastern also Banda Aceh (Sumatera) in the western. In 2016 will planned BRT system (Bus Rapid Transportation) serving between Purbalingga to Purwokerto.

This could be one of a little amount of additional bus station facilities in Indonesia. There is the first in Indonesia "Sleeper bus" serving Purbalingga/Purwokerto to Jakarta, which is a new facility where the beds are available inside and look just like a hotel's facility.
Cruising the roads in Purwokerto is challenging. The roads are not quite wide enough as ones in bigger city, and there are still Becaks (rickshaw-like tricycles) using the same roads with motor vehicles. We will hardly ever see traffic jam here, but we will frequently bump into another car cruising the road very slowly or motorcyclers who ride in the middle of the road with low speed. It will need quite an effort for people coming from big city to adjust life on the road of Purwokerto. It is advisable to use bicycles instead.
