The Argo Bromo executive train had 336 passengers on board, while the Senja Utama Semarang business train was bound for Semarang and carrying 663 passengers. The location of the crash was at track 4 of Petarukan station. The Argo Bromo Anggrek train was supposed to pass the slower Senja Utama Semarang train (which was waiting to be passed at track 4), on track 3, but it passed a danger signal and eventually rear-ended the waiting train. Three carriages derailed and overturned, 36 people were reported to have been killed and 50 injured, with the death toll expected to rise. The accident was the deadliest in Indonesia since the Bintaro train crash on 19 October 1987, which killed 156 people.Because of this crash, rear-end buffer cars (a baggage car, power car, or an empty passenger coach) were made mandatory for every locomotive-drawn passenger train in Indonesia.
