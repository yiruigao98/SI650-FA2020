== History ==

In 1971, a large Golden Pectoral was discovered on the site of Tovsta Mohyla near Pokrov by the Ukrainian archaeologist Boris Mozolevski. It probably belonged to a Scythian chieftain of the 3rd century BC, but was likely made by Greek artisans of the Crimean peninsula.
The city was established in 1956 when several miner settlements of the Ordzhonikidze Mine were merged into a city. Previously, in 1883 a Russian engineer-geologist Valerian Domger discovered rich deposits of manganese ore in a basin of the Solona River. Since that time, mining towns such as Prychepylivka (today – Hirnytske) started to appear in the area. In 1886 in place of the modern city were created Pokrovski quarries. Pokrov is located on the site of the 17th century Chortomlyk Sich.
On 15 May 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements with a name related to Communism. Since 2 April 2016, after it was officially renamed by the Ukrainian parliament, the city is officially named Pokrov.
