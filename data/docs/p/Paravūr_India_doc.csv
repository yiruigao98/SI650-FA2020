Paravur was under the administration of the Paravur king. Vypin was also in Parur. The Paravur king joined with Kochi country, but later Parur transferred to the Travancore area (1864) as part of an agreement. The taluk was divided into Paravur and Alangad. Alangad comprised most parts of present-day Aluva taluk. At that period Paravur area included Puthenchira, Mala area of Chalakudy taluk. Muziris was the centre of Indian spice trade for many centuries, and was known to the Yavanas (Greeks) as well as Romans, Jews, Arabs, and Chinese since ancient times.
