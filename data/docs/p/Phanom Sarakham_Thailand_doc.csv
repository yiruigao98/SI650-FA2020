Phanom Sarakham District (Thai: พนมสารคาม, pronounced [pʰā.nōm sǎː.rā.kʰāːm]) is a district (amphoe) in the central part of Chachoengsao Province, central Thailand.


== History ==
Mueang Phanom Sarakham was a city of Ayutthaya Kingdom, contemporaneous with Mueang Phanat Nikhom and Sanam Chai Khet. It became Phanom Sarakham District in 1894. In 1937 the district office was moved from Ban Mueang Mai, Phanom Sarakham Subdistrict to Ban Nong Ri, Mueang Kao Subdistrict.


== Geography ==
Neighbouring districts are (from the east clockwise): Sanam Chai Khet, Plaeng Yao, Ratchasan of Chachoengsao Province; Si Mahosot and Si Maha Phot of Prachinburi Province.
The important water resource is the Khlong Tha Lat.


== Economy ==
Ko Khanun Subdistrict has become a centre for recycling potentially hazardous electronic waste (e-waste), despite a June 2018 ban on imports of foreign e-waste to Thailand. China banned the import of foreign e-waste in 2018 also. Since the e-waste ban, 28 new recycling factories, most dealing with e-waste, have started in Chachoengsao Province, where Ko Khanun is located. In 2019, 14 businesses in Chachoengsao were granted licenses to process electronic waste, six of them in Ko Khanun in Phanom Sarakham District. An official of the Basel Action Network, which campaigns against dumping waste in poor countries, said, "E-waste has to go somewhere, and the Chinese are simply moving their entire operations to Southeast Asia. The only way to make money is to get huge volume with cheap, illegal labour and pollute the hell out of the environment," he added.
