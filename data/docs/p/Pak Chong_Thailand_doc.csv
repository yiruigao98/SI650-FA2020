Pak Chong District (Thai: ปากช่อง, pronounced [pàːk t͡ɕʰɔ̂ŋ]) is the westernmost district (amphoe) of Nakhon Ratchasima Province, northeastern Thailand.


== History ==
In the past this area was a part of Tambon Khanong Phra, Chan Thuek District (which is now Sikhio District).
In 1949 Ban Pak Chong was upgraded to Tambon Pak Chong. It was upgraded to a minor district (king amphoe) effective 1 January 1957, consisting of the four sub-districts Pak Chong, Chanthuek, Klong Dan, and Mu Si. It was upgraded to a full district in July 1958.


== Etymology ==
In the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) during the construction of the northeastern railway through the area, the Nok Yung and Noi mountains were blasted through to make a cut (chong in Thai) for the railway. The people named the village Pak Chong, meaning "mouth of the channel".

The district is the gateway to the northeast (Isan) of Thailand from the central region, as the main pass through the Sankamphaeng Range mountainous area is in the southern section of the district.
