The Pagani Huayra (Italian pronunciation: [ˈwai̯ra]) is a mid-engine sports car produced by Italian sports car manufacturer Pagani, succeeding the company's previous offering, the Zonda. It is named after Huayra-tata, a Quechua wind god. The Huayra was named "The Hypercar of the Year 2012" by Top Gear magazine. On 11 February 2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra has been sold out. The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG.The Pagani Huayra was officially debuted online with several pictures in a press release on 25 January 2011. The official world debut was at the headquarters of Pirelli in Milan in February 2011.


== Specifications ==

The Huayra has a top speed of about 383 km/h (238 mph) and it has a 0-97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds. Using Pirelli tyres, the Pagani Huayra is capable of withstanding 1.66 g of lateral acceleration
The Pagani Huayra uses a seven-speed sequential gearbox and a single disc clutch. The choice not to use a dual-clutch was due to the increase in weight of over 70 kg (154 lb), thus negating any advantage of the faster gear changes in a double-clutch transmission. As a result, the transmission weighs 96 kg (212 lb).The car is equipped with Brembo brake calipers, rotors and pads. The calipers have four pistons in front and four in the rear. The rotors are drilled carbon ceramic, 380 mm (15.0 in) in diameter and 34 mm (1.3 in) thick.The Huayra uses a 6.0 L (5,980 cc) twin-turbocharged M158 60° V12 engine developed by Mercedes-AMG specially for the Huayra, which has a power output of 730 PS (537 kW; 720 hp) at 5,800 rpm and 1,000 N⋅m (738 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 2,250-4,500 rpm. The engine has been designed at the request of Pagani to reduce turbo lag and improve response, achieved with smaller turbochargers, a different intercooler configuration and re-programmed ECU settings.
Like many high-performance cars, the Huayra uses dry sump lubrication. This has several key benefits including guaranteeing oil flow even when the car is subjected to extreme lateral acceleration, preventing "oil surge" which allows the engine to operate more efficiently while the lack of an oil pan allows mounting the engine lower, lowering the car's center of gravity and improving handling. The fuel consumption of the Huayra is 10 mpg‑US (23.5 L/100 km; 12.0 mpg‑imp) in city and 14 mpg‑US (16.8 L/100 km; 16.8 mpg‑imp) in highway (EPA testing).
A water / oil heat exchanger reduces engine warm-up times on cold days and helps maintain a stable temperature for refrigerants and lubricants.
To minimise the use of pipes and fittings (and the overall weight of the vehicle), the expansion tank is mounted directly on the engine. Intercooler fins act as an expansion tank circuit at low temperatures.
The titanium exhaust system was designed and built by MHG-Fahrzeugtechnik. Hydroformed joints were developed to reduce back pressure and ensure a free flow exhaust. Titanium reduces the weight of the exhaust system while the Inconel silencers improve reliability in the most exposed parts of the exhaust at high temperatures. The entire system weighs less than 10 kg (22 lb).


== Aerodynamics ==

The Pagani Huayra is different from its predecessor in that it incorporates active aerodynamics. It is capable of changing the height of the front from the ground and independently operating four flaps placed at the rear and front of the car. The behavior of the flaps is managed by a dedicated control unit that is fed information from systems such as the ABS and ECU, which pass on information about the car's speed, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, steering angle and throttle position. This is intended to achieve minimal drag coefficient or maximum downforce depending on the situation. The Huayra's designer Horacio Pagani states that it has a variable drag coefficient of between .31 and .37. The system also prevents excess body roll in the corners by raising the "inside" flaps (i.e. the left ones in a left-handed corner and vice versa), increasing the downforce on that side of the car. The rear flaps also act as an airbrake. Under hard braking, both the front suspension and the two rear flaps are raised to counter-act weight transfer to the front wheels and keep the whole car stable, for instance when entering a corner. Air from the radiator is extracted through an arch in the bonnet at an angle that is designed not to affect the streamline around the body. The side air intakes behind the front wheels create a low pressure zone, resulting in downforce.


== Variants ==


=== Huayra Roadster ===

After 2 years of development, the Huayra Roadster was officially unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.The over-all appearance of the car has changed, with the most obvious being the removable top (hence the Roadster name). This part of the vehicle is also its key element. The design of the rear is also different, with new eyelid-like fixed flaps that continue with the design and eventually end on the rear lights. The rear engine cover also has a new shape to adapt to the roadster form and now has vents for efficient cooling. The wheels are unique and specifically constructed for the car. The car has conventional doors instead of the Gull-wing doors of the coupé as they are impossible to fit on an open top car without maintaining the low weight
The vehicle utilises the same twin-turbocharged M158 V12 engine as the coupé, but it now has a total power output of 764 PS (562 kW; 754 hp) at 6,200 rpm and 1,000 N⋅m (738 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 2,400 rpm. All of this power is delivered to the rear wheels via an all-new 7-speed automated manual transmission by Xtrac. The car now uses a hydraulic and electronic activation system with carbon synchronizers. Bosch has also contributed in the construction of the car and the car uses their ECU system. The weight is now 70 kg (154 lb) lighter, for a total of 1,280 kg (2,820 lb), making it the first roadster lighter than the coupe version. Only 100 will be made, all of which have already been sold. The tyre supplier is Pirelli, with P-Zero tyres. The tyre have a white narrow outline, resembling those of an F1 race car. Pagani has also used a new material for the Roadster called carbon triax, which is a tri-axis fiberglass meshed with carbon-fibre power bands.
Pagani states that the car produces 816 kg (1,800 lb) of downforce or 1.8 lateral G-force. However, this figure is unproven, but if true, Pagani will have set a new record.


=== Huayra BC and BC roadster ===

The Huayra BC is a track focused version of the Huayra which was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The Huayra BC is named after the late Benny Caiola, a friend of Horacio Pagani, and the first Pagani customer. The Huayra BC has an improved version of the standard Huayra's 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine having a power output of 755 PS (555 kW; 745 hp) as well as 1,100 N⋅m (811 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The dry weight is reduced by 132 kg (291 lb) to just 1,218 kg (2,685 lb), thanks to the use of a new material called 'carbon triax' which Pagani claims is 50% lighter and 20% stronger than regular carbon fibre, giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 1.62 kg (3.57 lb) per horsepower. The Huayra BC comes with a lighter titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped out interior. The tires are Pirelli P-Zero Corsas that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an air diffuser that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper with a large rear wing. All of the exterior components in the car are used to optimize downforce and drag. The Huayra BC uses an all-new Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double-clutch gearboxes. All 20 units of the Huayra BC coupé have been sold out.Introduced in June 2019 on the CSR Racing 2 app, the Huayra BC Roadster is an open top variant of the Huarya BC. It shares the same aerodynamic parts as present on the BC but has a more powerful 6.0-litre twin-turbocharged V12 engine rated at 800 PS (588 kW; 789 hp) and 1,001 N⋅m (738 lb⋅ft) of torque. The 7-speed Xtrac sequential gearbox with single clutch used on the roadster is 35% lighter than a contemporary dual-clutch gearbox. The Huayra BC roadster is slightly heavier than the coupe and has a dry weight of 1,217 kg (2,683 lb) but is 30 kg (66 lb) lighter than the Huayra roadster. The monocoque of the roadster is constructed of carbon-titanium HP62 material to keep weight low and make the construction rigid. The BC roadster is claimed to generate 500 kg (1,102 lb) of downforce at 280 km/h (174 mph) due to its large fixed rear wing and aerodynamic elements. In addition to movable active Aero elements, the titanium exhaust incorporates flaps in the catalytic converters to divert exhaust gases over the underfloor elements like a Formula 1 car's blown diffuser. Production of the roadster will be limited to 40 units only.


== Special editions ==
Pagani has developed several special editions of the Huayra upon customer request.


=== Carbon Edition ===

The first special edition was the Pagani Huayra Carbon Edition, unveiled in 2012, along with the White Edition. It features a full carbon fibre body, wheels and interior trim, hence the "carbon" part of the name. The interior features red leather upholstery and carbon fibre inserts. The specifications are the same as the standard Huayra.


=== White Edition ===

The White Edition was unveiled in 2012, along with the Carbon Edition. The car features a white and black carbon fibre exterior, a white and black interior, and aluminum wheels.


=== La Monza Lisa ===
This special edition Huayra, called "La Monza Lisa" was built for well known car collector Kris Singh. It features tricolore racing stripes and side stripes inspired by the Zonda Revolucion, and a bright red interior with white stitching inspired by a Zonda F Roadster. At the customer's request, Pagani also reengineered the firewall behind the occupants to be finished in a mixture of matte and gloss fully exposed carbon fibre for visual effect as well as to pass more engine vibration through to the carbon fibre seats, per the customer's request. La Monza Lisa also features a one-off exhaust system and bespoke turbochargers built by Michael Kübler and Mercedes-AMG.


=== 730S "Da Vinci" ===

The 730S special edition was unveiled at the AutoGallery of Beverly Hills in February 2015. Most of the car's specifications are heavily inspired from the Zonda Tricolore. The car was specially built for Alejandro Salomon (a.k.a. Salomondrin), a Mexican-American entrepreneur, former film producer and YouTube personality.
The car was later sold to David Lee, a jewelry and watch tycoon and a well known Ferrari collector, due to Salomondrin's complaints after driving it for a year. The car was later renamed "Da Vinci" by Lee after his purchase and was upgraded with the Tempesta package.


=== Huayra BC Kingtasma ===
A Pagani Huayra BC, finished in red carbon fibre, was delivered to the United States and is dubbed "Kingtasma" by the owner. The Kingtasma is one of only four Pagani Huayra BC models equipped with a roof scoop, it is also the only Huayra BC fitted with a cup holder from the factory. It also features gold carbon fibre crowns on the underside of both of the rear flaps. The Huayra BC Kingtasma is owned by an American real estate tycoon from the east coast of the United States. The owner, same father-son duo, also own the Pagani Huayra called "The King".


=== Huayra BC Macchina Volante ===

Collector Kris Singh had commissioned a special BC called "Macchina Volante" (the Flying Machine) built in 2017, with extra amounts of blue carbon fiber and a few Italian flags adorning it. It also has additional rear air intakes and blue brake calipers.


=== Pearl ===

The Huayra Pearl, unveiled in May 2016, is a special edition of the Huayra. It features the split rear wing inspired by the Zonda C12, and the roof air scoop inspired by the Zonda Cinque. Like the Carbon Edition and Da Vinci, the car has an exposed carbon fibre body finished in a dark blue colour. It was involved in an accident in Paris in July 2016 but was rebuilt again by the factory in 2017 with an upgraded engine now having a power output of 1,350 PS (1,332 hp; 993 kW), making it the most powerful Huayra ever made. It can accelerate from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) in 2.2 seconds and has a claimed top speed in excess of 380 km/h (236 mph). It shares many components with the Huayra BC and the Zonda R including the suspension, gearbox, top mounted air intake and the motorsport derived carbo-titanium monocoque which reduces weight by 132 kg (291 lb) less than before. The rebuild took 24 months to complete.


=== Dinastia ===
The Huayra Dinastia was a special edition of three Huayra coupés revealed to the public in 2016. Horacio Pagani's inspiration for this car came from the Nine-Dragon Wall in China. Three cars were initially planned to be built and sold, but after October 2016, based on the request of customers and after the research proving that the purple and red are in the same colour family (shades of magenta), the Red has been replaced with the Purple. Each unit also has a certain livery. The design of the car reflects Horacio's visit with each unit's livery design resembling one of the dragons on the wall, and it also has an aerodynamic fin on the rear, mostly likely to resemble a dragon's tail.
The liveries of the cars are:

Blue carbon livery (Baxia, the water dragon)
Purple carbon livery (Yazi, the warrior dragon)
Gold carbon livery (Chiwen, the protective dragon of fire and rain)Mechanically, the Dinastia is identical to the normal Pagani Huayra however, Pagani has installed a lighter titanium exhaust system, new 21-inch forged aluminium alloy wheels, a new front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an additional rear fin to help the air stream to minimize drag.


=== Hermes Edition ===
The Huayra Hermès Edition, unveiled in 2016, is a special edition Huayra owned by Iranian-American millionaire Manny Khoshbin. It features the Tempesta package as well as coffee brown colored exposed carbon fiber bodywork and a matching custom caramel leather interior designed by Hermès, and handmade and stitched at their factory in Paris. Other changes include a custom Hermès shift knob, intake grates with laser cut  "H" pattern reminiscent of their logo, and a set of matching Huayra luggage bags.


=== L'Ultimo ===
The L'Ultimo is the final Huayra coupé built for a US based customer. It features the same mechanical components as a normal Huayra coupé but features many bespoke parts unique to the car, such as the Pacchetto Tempesta aerodynamics package, a roof scoop inspired by the Zonda R and a bespoke rear wing. The paint work is also unique and takes inspiration from Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton's F1 car. The interior is also in contrast with the exterior colour and features white leather seats with turquoise floor mats and centre console.


=== Imola ===
Named after the famous Italian racing track, the Imola is a special variant of the Huayra featuring aggressive aerodynamic parts. The Imola was unveiled in September 2019 at a private ceremony held in Switzerland and will be limited to only 5 examples. The first customer of the Imola is Oleg Egorov, founder and owner of TopCar Design. 
The Imola is the most powerful variant of the Huayra to date, using the same Mercedes-AMG V12 tuned to 838 PS (827 hp; 616 kW) and 1,100 N⋅m (811 lb⋅ft). Weight saving measures such as new a new carbon fibre blend and lightweight paint application have reduced the Imola's dry weight to 1,246 kg (2,747 lb). Exterior changes from the standard Huayra include a large seven-section diffuser with orange accents, a large roof scoop, a shark fin, more pronounced side skirts and a wide fixed rear wing with an integrated stoplight.
