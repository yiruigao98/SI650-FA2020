It lies in the Great Plains and is Terai area, very close to piedmont plains of Himalayas, and is very close to borders of Nepal and Bihar. It is located on the bank of river Bansi, a Ganges tributary originating in Nepal. The town presents characteristics distinct from natural features of the western districts of Uttar Pradesh. This difference is due primarily to the relative proximity of the Himalayas, the outermost foothills of which are only a few kilometres from the northern borders. The peak of Dhaulagiri, some 8,230 meters above sea-level, is visible under favourable climatic conditions as far south as Padrauna itself. Below the outer hills is a dry boulder-strewn tract, corresponding to the Bhabar of Kumaun and Garhwal and here the bulk of the moisture contributed by the rainfall and the small streams is absorbed by the soil, to reappear through seepage in the damp and unhealthy tract, known as the terai. The climate is extreme temperate climate, with soaring temperatures in summer crossing 40 degrees and in winters temperatures as low as 3 to 4 degrees.
There are a number of cinemas and malls and supermarkets in Kanhaiya Takij, Krishna Takij, Sahu Palace, Padrauna such as Unik Bazar, V2, Super Market, City Cart, and V Mart. A city mall has also been proposed. It is currently under construction.
