Pematangsiantar (sometimes written as Pematang Siantar, acronym PS or P. Siantar, colloquially just Siantar), is an independent city in North Sumatra, Indonesia, surrounded by, but not part of, the Simalungun Regency, making Pematangsiantar an enclave within Simalungun Regency. Pematangsiantar formerly had the status of a second level district (daerah tingkat dua) and was the administrative centre of the surrounding Regency, but it has recently been elevated to Kota (City) and separated from the Regency.

== History ==
Before 1907, Pematangsiantar was a Kingdom led by the Damanik. Damanik is one of the clans of the Simalungun ethnic group of the Batak people. The last king of the dynasty was Tuan Sangnawaluh Damanik. In 1907, the Dutch took control, turning Pematangsiantar into their colony. The city remained under Dutch control until 1942 when the Japanese invaded and ruled over Indonesia.
After Indonesia proclaimed its freedom in 1945, Pematangsiantar was granted autonomous status. In 1974, Pematangsiantar became a second level district, and was appointed as the capital of Simalungun Regency.

Pematangsiantar is 50 kilometres from Lake Toba on the Trans-Sumatran Highway. Lake Toba is one of the largest volcanic calderas in the world, and a major tourism destination.  It is common to see tourists stopping over in Pt. Siantar. Siantar is famous for Batak culture, 'Batik' and 'Ulos' fabric, and Batak foods. There is a zoo worth visiting that is aptly named Taman Hewan
Pematangsiantar - animal garden of
Pematangsiantar (Kebun
Binatang Pemetangsiantar in Indonesian).
It has a good collection of Indonesian native
animals, most notably birds, tigers and apes.
The zoo itself boasts abundant tropical trees
and plants, some of which are quite old. The
location is close to the main roads
of the city (within walking distance).

kind in Indonesia. The temple complex is
accessible from Jl. Pane. It is part of a new
temple complex. Adjacent to the new complex and connected by a bridge across the
river of Bah Bolon, the old building of the
temple was burned completely in an inferno
in May, 2008.

Foods such as saksang (pork cooked in its own blood) and roasted pork, or drinks like tuak (an alcoholic beverage made from sugar palm and sometimes from coconut) prepared by the Batak people are very popular.
Chinese restaurants can also be found across the city. One of the very popular local delicacies inherited from Chinese food is "Mie Pangsit" (Wonton noodles). Minangkabau cuisine is also quite popular, especially Nasi Padang (various dishes with rice) and Sate Padang (spicy satay, usually eaten with rice-cake).
