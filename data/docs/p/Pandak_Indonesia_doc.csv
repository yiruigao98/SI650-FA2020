Bantul (Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈbantʊl]) is a regency located in the Yogyakarta Special Region, Indonesia. It is located on the island of Java. The regency's population was 911,503 at the 2010 Census, but has risen to 947,568 according to the latest (January 2014) official estimate. Like many regencies on the island of Java, it is densely populated with roughly 1,865 people per square kilometre, although this is largely because the north of the regency partly surrounds the city of Yogyakarta and contains many suburban communities.
The regency is bordered by the city of Yogyakarta and Sleman regency to the north, the regency of Kulon Progo to the west, the Gunung Kidul Regency to the east and the Indian Ocean to the south. The town of Bantul is the administrative centre.
The village Kemusuk in the Sedayu district in the regency is the birthplace of former Indonesian President, Suharto.
