== Geography ==

The Nan and Yom Rivers flow through Phichit Province, joining shortly before the Chao Phraya is formed. The province mainly consists of low fertile river plains, making rice and lotus the main crops.


== History ==
The town of Phichit was established in 1058 by Phraya Kotabongthevaraja (พระยาโคตระบอง), and was first part of the Sukhothai Kingdom, and later of Ayutthaya. An old temple in Pho Prathap Chang District is Wat Pho Prathap Chang (วัดโพธิ์ประทับช้าง). It was built by Phra Chao Suea, an Ayutthaya king, in 1701 at a site reputed to be his birthplace. The site is surrounded by double-walls and huge trees, some of which are over 200 years old.The name of the main city changed several times. At first it was called Sa Luang ('city of the royal pond'). In Ayutthaya times it was called Okhaburi ('city in the swamp'), and then finally Phichit ('beautiful city').


== Symbols ==
The provincial seal shows a pond, which refers to the old name of Phichit, Mueang Sa Luang ("city of the royal pond"). The banyan tree in front refers to Wat Pho Prathap Chang. The temple was built in 1669-1671 by King Luang Sorasak, who was born in the village of Pho Prathap Chang, between a banyan and a sacred fig.
The flag of Phichit shows the circular provincial seal in the middle. It has three green bars and two white horizontal bars, with the middle bar being interrupted by the seal.
The provincial tree is the ironwood. The provincial flower is the lotus.
