== History ==
Puente de Ixtla belonged to the seigniory of Cuauhnahuac and was thus tributary of the Aztecs. Prehispanic ruins have been found near the Church of San Mateo Apostol.A stone bridge was constructed over the Rio Chalma and the village became a place of required passage for the caravans from Acapulco to Mexico City.
A strong earthquake on April 7, 1845, did considerable damage in Puente de Ixtla and may have been responsible for the flooding of the village of Tequesquitengo, Jojutla.With the creation of the Morelos in 1869, Puente de Ixtla was one of the already existing municipalities.
July 12, 1871: annexation of the villages of Xoxocotla, Tehuixtla and of the hacienda of San Jose Vista Hermosa; later, Xoxocotla was attached to the municipality of Jojutla. The town Xoxocotla is scheduled to become an independent municipality on January 1, 2019.Between 1913 and 1914 the population of Puente de Ixtla was evacuated because of the Revolution. One of the marks of the revolution is missing in the belfry of the Church of San Mateo, which was collapsed by a cannonball.On Monday, April 26, 1920, President Álvaro Obregón, traveling from Iguala, met Francisco Cossio Robelo from Cuernavaca in Puente de Ixtla. This essentially ended the Mexican Revolution in the south of Mexico.
The Puente Chalma over the Chalma River along the Cuernavaca-Iguala tollway collapsed on July 26, 2014. Two cars fell into the river and three people were injured.While Morelos did not suffer significant damage in the September 7, 2017 earthquake, seventy-four people were killed in the September 19 earthquake. 23,000 buildings were damaged in the state, including 293 homes destroyed and 816 damaged in Puente de Ixtla.Mario Ocampo Ocampo of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018. When City Hall failed to pay MXN $1,3000,000 (US $66,540) to a disabled police officer in September 2019, an administrative court judge (Tribunal de Justicia Administrativa) ordered the mayor, trustee, and councilors to all step down for three years.The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; four cases were reported in Puente de Ixtla.

=== Hacienda de San José Vista Hermosa ===
This 16th-century hacienda founded by Hernan Cortes is now a luxury restaurant/hotel with 105 rooms.
Established in the 16th century, the hacienda was sold by Pedro Cortés Ramírez de Arellano, grandson of the conqueror, in 1621, to Fray de Dios Guerrero. In the early 18th century, the hacienda was sold to Gabriel Yermo who in 1820 sold it to Manuel Vicente Vidal, being owned by this family until 1910, when the Mexican Revolution broke out. Emiliano Zapata took over the hacienda, burned alcohol, and distributed sugar among the peasants. The hacienda was restored and the hotel opened in 1945.
