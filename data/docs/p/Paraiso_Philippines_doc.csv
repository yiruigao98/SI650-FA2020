In the Philippines, a ZIP code is used by the Philippine Postal Corporation (PhlPost) to simplify the distribution of mail. While its function similar with the ZIP Codes used in the United States, its form and usage are quite different. The use of ZIP codes in the Philippines is not mandatory, however it is highly recommended by the PhlPost. Also, unlike American ZIP Codes, the Philippine code is a four-digit number representing two things: in Metro Manila, a barangay within a city or city district (as in the case for Manila), and outside Metro Manila, a municipality or city. Usually, more than one code is issued for areas within Metro Manila, and provincial areas are issued one code for each municipality and city, with some rare exceptions such as Dasmariñas in Cavite, which has three ZIP codes (4114, 4115, and 4126), Los Baños in Laguna, which has two ZIP codes (4030 and 4031 for the University of the Philippines Los Baños), and Angeles, which has two ZIP codes (2009 and 2024 for Barangay Balibago).This article provides a list of Philippine ZIP codes. Cities that have become independent of a province are listed under their former province (as is the practice for statistical purposes).
