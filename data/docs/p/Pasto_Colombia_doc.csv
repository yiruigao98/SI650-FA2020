Pasto, officially San Juan de Pasto (Spanish pronunciation: [saŋ ˈxwan de ˈpasto]; "Saint John of Pasto"), is the capital of the department of Nariño, in southern Colombia. The city has approximately 392,930 inhabitants and is located in the Atriz Valley on the Andes cordillera, at the foot of the Galeras volcano.


== History ==
Pasto refers to the indigenous people who inhabited the region at the arrival of the Spanish conquerors, the Pastos. However, the Atriz Valley was inhabited by the Quillacingas.
Pasto was founded in 1537 by the Spanish conquistador Sebastián de Belalcázar. In 1539 another Spanish conquistador Lorenzo de Aldana moved the city to its current location, and established it under the name "San Juan de Pasto". A major contributor to the economy and expansion of Pasto was a man of Italian origin named Guido Bucheli.
It has been an administrative, cultural and religious center of the region since colonial times. Because of this, the city is known as the theological city of Colombia. During the Independence Wars against Spain Pasto was a royalist city. Partly due to this political stance, and because of its geographical location, after independence, Pasto remained isolated for a long time from the rest of Colombia.
