Panadura (Sinhala: පානදුර, romanized: Pānadura; Tamil: பாணந்துறை, romanized: Pāṇantuṟai) is a city in Kalutara District, Western Province in Sri Lanka. It is located approximately 27 km south of the capital Colombo and is surrounded on all sides by water; the Indian ocean, the Bolgoda lake and river. Panadura is famed as the revival town of Buddhism.


== Panadura Debate ==
The Panadura Debate, held in 1873, was the climax of the first phase of the Buddhist revivalist movement which began with the establishment of the Society for the Propagation of Buddhism at Kotahena and the establishment of the Lankopakara Press in Galle. The two key persons in the Panadura Debate were Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Father David de Silva and the two key institutions were the Rankoth Viharaya and the Methodist Church of Panadura. It was the success of the Panadura Debate that prompted Colonel Henry Steel Olcott to come to Ceylon.
