Portici (Italian pronunciation: [ˈpɔrtitʃi]) is a town and comune of the Metropolitan City of Naples in Italy. It is the site of the Portici Royal Palace.


== Geography ==
Portici lies at the foot of Mount Vesuvius on the Bay of Naples, about 8 km (5.0 mi) southeast of Naples itself. There is a small port. To the south east is Ercolano, formerly Resina, which occupies the site of ancient Herculaneum. San Giorgio a Cremano is another town nearby.


== History ==
The city was completely destroyed by the Eruption of Vesuvius in 1631, but was rebuilt. Charles III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily, built a royal palace in the town between 1738–1748. After Garibaldi defeated the Bourbons in 1860, the palace was turned into the Portici botanic gardens and the Royal Higher School of Agriculture.  It once contained the antiquities from Herculaneum, which have since been moved to Naples.

Later a more diversified economy emerged, with industry and trade as main pillars.Vincenzo Cuomo is the mayor.
