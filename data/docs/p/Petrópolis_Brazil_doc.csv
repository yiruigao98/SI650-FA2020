Petrópolis (Portuguese pronunciation: [peˈtɾɔpolis], [pɛˈtɾɔpolis], [pɛˈtɾɔpɔliɕ], [pɛˈtɾɔpuliɕ]), also known as The Imperial City, is a municipality in the Southeast Region of Brazil, inside the Rio de Janeiro state located 68 kilometres (42 mi) northeast of the Rio de Janeiro city. According to the 2010 National Brazilian Census, Petrópolis municipality had 305,917 inhabitants that year, up from 286,537 inhabitants at the last census.

The town's name ("city of Peter") honors Pedro II, the last Emperor of Brazil, who is entombed there at the Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara. The city was the summer residence of the Brazilian Emperors and aristocrats in the 19th century, and was the official capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro during the First Brazilian Republic, between 1894 and 1902.There are projects to annex Petrópolis again to the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, because it is linked to the capital by political and economic ties, and contains one of the state's largest HDIs.


== History ==


=== Colonial period ===

Until the 18th century, the region was inhabited by the índios coroados (crowned Indians), which earned it the Portuguese name of "Sertão dos Índios Coroados". It was only with the discovery of gold in Minas Gerais and the consequent opening of the new way of the mines that passed through Petrópolis in that century that the region began to be occupied by non-Indians. The town's origins can be traced to Bernardo Soares de Proença, who between 1722 and 1725 opened an alternative route between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, across the Serra da Estrela called "Caminho Novo das Minas" (New Road to Mines).


=== Imperial period ===

While traveling to Minas Gerais along this route in 1822, Emperor Pedro I found the region's climate pleasant, while staying at the farm of Correia, a Catholic priest. As the priest's sister and heiress refused to sell his property, the Emperor bought in 1830 the neighboring one, the Córrego Seco Farm. He had his Summer Palace built there, but never saw it finished, because he stepped down from the throne, on April 7, 1831. Other Brazilian aristocrats eventually followed suit.
His son, Emperor Pedro II, on March 16, 1843, signed an imperial decree ordering the construction of a settlement (to be formed with the arrival of German immigrants) and the construction of the dreamy summer palace on his outlying lands, the cornerstone of which was settled by the Emperor in May 1845, and that was ready in 1847. Conceived by Major Julius Friedrich Koeler, it is considered as the second projected city of Brazil (after Recife, designed during the Dutch period), being composed of an urban nucleus – the city (now the center), where the Imperial Palace, Public buildings, commerce and services.
From then on, during the summer, the city became the de facto capital of the Empire of Brazil, with the change of the whole court. Large numbers of inhabitants of the city of Rio de Janeiro also moved during the summer to Petrópolis to escape the outbreaks of yellow fever. Emperor Pedro II ruled for 49 years and, in at least forty summers, remained in Petrópolis, possibly for up to five months. On 29 September 1857, the town was elevated to the status of a city. In 1861, the first Macadamized Highway in Brazil, Estrada União e Indústria, was inaugurated, connecting the city to the city of Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais. In 1883, the railroad arrived at the city on the initiative of the Baron of Mauá. Also in 1877 the first telephone line of Brazil connecting his Summer Palace to his farm headquarters, which was also the first line outside the United States, was installed in the city.
Regardless of the time of year, it was in Petrópolis that foreign diplomatic representatives lived for most of the imperial period.


=== Republican period ===

Even after the establishment of the Republic and the exile of the Imperial family in 1889, the city continued to play a significant role in Brazilian history. It was a frequent choice as summer residence for Presidents of the republic, who lodged at the Palácio Rio Negro (Black River Palace). The most frequent of them was Getúlio Vargas, whose stays, during Estado Novo, lasted up to three months. In the premises of the Quitandinha Palace, the declaration of war of the American countries to the Axis Powers was signed during World War II (1939–1945).
Between 1894 and 1902, the city was capital of the State of Rio de Janeiro, replacing Niterói, due to the two Navy Revolts. Also in this period, was chosen Hermogênio Silva, the only Deputy Governor of Rio de Janeiro whose political base was in Petrópolis. In 1897, the first cinema session took place in the city, with cinematographer showing of the Lumière brothers' first films. In 1903, the Treaty of Petrópolis, which gave Brazil the Acre territory, was signed between Brazil and Bolivia, at the residence of the Baron of Rio Branco. The sanitarian Oswaldo Cruz was named its first mayor in 1916.
During the Brazilian military government in 1970s, there was a centre for torture, called the House of Death.

In 1973 the remains of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921) and her husband, the Count of Eu, were brought to be buried in the Imperial Mausoleum. The Princess received a funeral of Head of State with the presence of the most important leaders of the Republic and the Brazilian Imperial Family and was declared a public holiday.
