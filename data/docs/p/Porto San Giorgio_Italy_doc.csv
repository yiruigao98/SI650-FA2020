== History ==
Already famous at the times of Pliny the Elder as Navale Firmanorum and cited by Strabo and in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Castrum Firmanorum (Citadel of Fermo), it was bound to the development of the port of Fermo, probably situated to the estuary of the Ete river and connected to the city of Fermo by the Pompeiana road.


== Railways ==
The Porto San Giorgio-Fermo station is on the Ancona-Pescara railway line of the Ferrovie dello Stato.
Porto San Giorgio was connected to Amandola through a 56-kilometre (35 mi) narrow gauge railway with 950-millimetre (37 in) track, the so-called "Italian gauge", which was disabled in 1956.
