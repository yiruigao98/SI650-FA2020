He pointed out past mistakes in naming the Jakarta-Cikampek toll road. The location of interchanges are geographically is located in Cikopo, Bungursari, Purwakarta. There is also the distance between the interchanges and the toll gate to the boundary of Cikopo with Cikampek, still 3 kilometers away. Finally, at the inauguration in June 2015 the name of this toll road changed from the Cikampek-Palimanan Toll Road (Cikapali) to the Cikopo-Palimanan Toll Road (Cipali).


== Opening ==
On 13 June 2015, Cikopo–Palimanan toll road was opened by Indonesian president, Joko Widodo. Since then, Jakarta and Cirebon are now directly connected by toll road.


=== Accidents after opening ===
Within 10 days of being inaugurated by President Jokowi, there have been 30 accidents in this Cikopo-Palimanan toll causing a number of people killed and injured. This concerns the public. The accident was caused by various things, the most dominating factor being due to  human error  as the road is straight and long, causing driver drowsiness. Furthermore, not all of the rest areas along the toll road are in operation, causing drivers to drive continuously with no rest. Another cause of the accident was due to the absence of lighting facilities.
