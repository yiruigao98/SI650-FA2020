In 1770, agriculture and business were disrupted by a major drought that hit the Krishna and Godavari deltas. The drought has had an adverse effect on the textile industry, which is home to the palakollu industry. The Dutch industry reports that the textile industry in the palakollu in region had slowed down in the late 18th century. The rise of textile imports from England in the 19th century, along with other Coromandel coastal textile centers, has also severely damaged Palakollu textile.

This has caused the palakollu industry to become the center of the textile industry.
