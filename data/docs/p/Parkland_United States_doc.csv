Parkland is known for its zoning laws, which are designed to protect the "park-like" character of the city. There were no stores or traffic lights in Parkland until the mid-1990s and early 2000s when large neighborhood developments (Heron Bay and Parkland Isles) were built.
On February 14, 2018, a gunman killed 17 people and injured 17 others in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the deadliest shooting at an American high school.
