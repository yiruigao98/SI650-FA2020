Abortion statistics in the United States vary by source because reporting is not mandatory. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Guttmacher Institute regularly report these statistics using different methodologies. Abortion statistics are commonly presented as the number of abortions, the abortion rate (the number of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to  44) or the abortion ratio (the number of abortions per 1,000 live births to women ages 15 to 44). 


== CDC surveillance reports ==
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began abortion surveillance reports in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. CDC compiles the information that most states, the District of Columbia and New York City collect to produce national estimates. The CDC numbers, published annually, are derived from actual counts of every abortion reported to state health departments. Reporting to the CDC is not mandatory, and some states choose not to report abortions to the CDC. CDCâ€™s surveillance system compiles information on legal induced abortions only. Because reporting is voluntary, CDC surveillance reports undercount the actual number of abortions in the United States.
For 2016, CDC reported 623,471 abortions from 48 of the 52 reporting areas. The abortion rate was 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 years, and the abortion ratio was 186 abortions per 1,000 live births.Note that there is a large decrease in reported abortions between 1997 and 1998. This is because CDC's reporting areas were reduced from 52 in 1997 to 47 in 1998.  The actual decline from 1997 to 1998 in those 47 reporting areas was only 2%.
Table of Abortion Totals Reported by the CDCNote: From 2006-2015, CDC estimates are based on 49 reporting areas (the health departments of 47 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City). In 2016, CDC estimates are based on 48 reporting areas. California, Maryland, New Hampshire, and the District of Columbia did not report to the CDC on abortion surveillance for that year. The abortion rates in 1970-2005 are retrieved from, 2006 from, and 2007-2016 from.


== Guttmacher Institute estimates ==
Unlike the CDC, the abortion rights research and policy organization Guttmacher Institute does not rely only on state reports but instead periodically surveys abortion providers in all states to estimate the number of abortions in the United States.For 2014, the Guttmacher Institute reported 926,200 abortions, an abortion rate of 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 years. For 2017, the Guttmacher Institute reported 862,320 abortions, an abortion rate of 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 years.
