Puli Township (Chinese: 埔里鎮; pinyin: Pǔlǐ zhèn; Wade–Giles: P'u3-li3 chen4; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Po͘-lí-tìn) is an urban township in Nantou County, Taiwan. The township is located within the Puli Basin. It is the geographic center of Taiwan.


== Name ==
In the 19th century the city was known as Posia (Chinese: 埔社; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Po͘-siā) or Po-li-sia (埔裏社). The Atayal name of the settlement was Sabaha Bakalas, meaning "house of stars". From 1920, during the Japanese era, the town was administered as Hori Town (埔里街), Nōkō District (能高郡), Taichū Prefecture.


== History ==


=== Spread of Christianity ===
In 1870, a native of Po-li-sia named Khai-san received treatment for a medical issue in a missionary hospital in Taiwan-fu (present-day Tainan) and learned about Christianity. When he returned home, he spread information about Christianity to the people of the area. In July 1871, two native preachers were sent to the area after reports concerning the spread of Christianity in Po-li-sia were heard of in Taiwan-fu. They reported back that "a movement, favourable to Christianity, had really taken place" in the area. Members of the Canada Presbyterian Mission visited the area in March 1872. In late 1872, William Campbell was part of an armed party that traversed the jungle, mountains and streams between Toa-sia and Po-li-sia to participate in examining candidates for baptism who lived in Po-li-sia.


=== Chi Chi earthquake ===
In 1999, this town was damaged by the 921 earthquake. The damage was especially severe in Taomi Village a small rural village located within Puli Township. 10 years on, the village has since re-invented itself to be the pride of Taiwan's eco-tourism industry. Especially after the opening of the Paper Dome, now a major attraction in Puli Township, Taomi Village was transformed from a sleepy agricultural village to one that is busting with activities related to community redevelopment and eco-tourism. Since then, Taomi Village has seen vibrancy unprecedented since its glory days in the 1970s as an agricultural hub.
