Perungudi is a neighbourhood of Chennai in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is situated about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of Adyar. It is bordered on two sides by the Old Mahabalipuram Road and the Perungudi lake. It is situated on the Old Mahabalipuram IT Expressway right in middle of an Information Technology (IT) Estate. It is between Taramani and Thoraipakkam and parallel to Kottivakkam and Palavakkam in the East Coast Road (ECR Highway).
The suburb is inhabited by an equal mix of new migrants and descendants of some early clans who migrated to the area approximately 300 years ago. Perungudi is seeing heightened activities in recent years due to its strategic location. The population of Perungudi was approximately 8,000 in 2000 but has grown significantly in the years since then. Being in the IT Corridor of Chennai, Perungudi is increasingly being preferred as a residential locality by software engineers. Despite this significant growth, Perungudi lacks basic civic amenities such as underground storm and waste drainage system, piped potable water and good roads.. This region has gained more importance owing to its location on the IT highway and proximity to city neighbourhoods like Thiruvanmiyur, Adyar and Velachery.
