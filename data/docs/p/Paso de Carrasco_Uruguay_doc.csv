== History ==
The original passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1947.
In 2003 the Uruguayan government transferred the administration, operation and maintenance of the airport to the private investment group Puerta del Sur S.A, which since then invested in several upgrades of the airport.
On 3 February 2007, construction began on a new and modern terminal that is located parallel to Runway 06/24.  The new terminal, designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly, has the capacity to handle 3 million passengers a year, including a much larger parking area built for over 1200 vehicles.  This new terminal building has four jetways, separate floors for arrivals and departures and a large viewing area on the top floor.  The terminal has room for expansion for two additional jetways and a maximum capacity of 6 million passengers per year before the building would need actual enlargement. The new terminal was inaugurated on 5 October 2009 with official operations beginning on 29 December 2009.
A new US$15 million cargo terminal was also constructed.
There is also a GA zone, with a Cessna Maintenance Facility (Sofitech) and several LAR 141 Flight Schools which operate in this Airport as homebase.
Regular passenger flights were suspended in mid March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular flights to Spain were resumed in July, and to São Paulo and Santiago in August.


== Facilities ==
Runway 06/24 has been strengthened and lengthened to 3,200 metres (10,499 ft), which allows airlines to operate non-stop flights to the United States and Europe. Runway 01/19 was lengthened to 2,250 metres (7,382 ft) and the former Runway 10/28 is permanently closed because the new terminal cuts across it.
The Runway 06/24 length includes a 412 metres (1,352 ft) displaced threshold on Runway 06, and a 207 metres (679 ft) displaced threshold on Runway 24.

The Carrasco VOR-DME (Ident: CRR) is located on the field. There are several non-directional beacons around the airport associated with instrument approach procedures.
