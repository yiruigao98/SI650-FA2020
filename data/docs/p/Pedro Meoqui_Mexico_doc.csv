== History ==
The community of Meoqui was founded as a Franciscan mission town in the mid-seventeenth century. In 1709, Fray Andrés Ramírez, a missionary of San Francisco de Asís and the recognized founder of Meoqui, arrived from San Antonio de Julimes as part of a larger effort to Christianize the Indians along the San Pedro River and began the development and colonization of the area along the San Pablo River, then inhabited by indigenous Conchos, Julimes, Navichames and Mezquites. The region was subject to the rule of the regional military presidios from the end of the 17th Century until 1773, when the Military Presidio of San Pablo was established.
In 1771, Irish soldier and commander Hugo O'Conor, who had served in the Spanish Royal Army since 1750 and had distinguished himself as a military strategist in several of the Spanish colonies, was appointed Captain and assigned to the northern frontier of New Spain. On January 20, 1773 he was promoted to Colonel and appointed Commandant Inspector of Presidios for all of Nueva Viscaya. In 1773, Colonel O'Conor established the home base of his garrison, the 4th Flying Company, in the area, establishing the Presidio of San Pablo. From there, he led multiple campaigns further north in 1775 and 1776 to establish Spanish control over the area and pushing the Apaches further west. O’Conor and the Presidio commanders who followed him ruled the area politically until 1826, when the Presidio came under the political jurisdiction of San Jerónimo and began to function as an Ayuntamiento (town). In 1837 the town became part of the Rosales Subprefecture, ten years after the Rosales Canton was established. In 1886, the town was integrated into the Canton of Meoqui, and from 1887 to 1911 was part of the Camargo District.
The name of the community and the surrounding municipality, adopted in 1866, is in honor of General Pedro Meoqui Mañon, a military leader from the city of Mexico. He participated in the Puebla campaign in Nueva México with Ignacio Comonfort; during the War of Reform he was active in the conservative ranks and participated in their Intervention. In 1864, when Meoqui Mañon was a colonel, he escorted Benito Juárez from Monterrey to Chihuahua, passing through the community en route. In 1866, Juárez returned to the community and decided to consecrate the community - a town located about an hour from the state capital of Chihuahua - as the Villa of General Pedro Meoqui Mañón (colloquially referred to as "Meoqui") on December 11 as a tribute to his faithful friend who was cruelly murdered on August 8, 1865 in Hidalgo del Parral in the Battle of Parral against the French.
In 1966, the town of Meoqui acquired the designation of City.
