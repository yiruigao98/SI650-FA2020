== General information ==

The area has been settled since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by excavations at places such as the artificial caves of Casal do Pardo and the Castro of Chibanes. The town's name comes from its Roman founder, Cornelius Palma (Palmella). Palmela, once a fortress, was conquered by the Portuguese in the 12th century. A semi-rural town, it is located up a hill in the Arrábida area, right in the middle of Portugal's biggest urban area. Many people are moving in from big cities like Lisbon. Wild fires in the region are a threat to the environment.
The castle, Castelo de Palmela, offers a unique view over the whole region of the Setúbal Peninsula, Lisbon, and the Atlantic Coast. It was a strategic place in past centuries, and today it is still a main juncture of Portugal's road and rail networks.
Palmela is home to many multinational industrial plants like Volkswagen and Coca-Cola, and a significant number of foreign families live in the area. The local radio often broadcasts in Ukrainian.
Palmela's traditional products are the wine, which has achieved international awards in several festivals like Bordeaux's, and the Queijo de Azeitão (Azeitão's cheese). There are several festivals dedicated to these products, the most famous being the Festa das Vindimas (Vines' Festival) and the Festival do Queijo, Pão e Vinho (Festival of Cheese, Bread and Wine).
Palmela is the birthplace of the Portuguese explorer Hermenegildo Capelo. Some other famous individuals such as Hans Christian Andersen were briefly hosted there.
