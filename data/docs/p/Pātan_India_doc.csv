== History ==
Patan was established by the Chavda ruler Vanaraja in 8th century as "Anahilapataka". During 10th-13th century, the city served as the capital of the Chaulukyas, who supplanted the Chavdas. Historian Tertius Chandler estimates that Anhilwara (Patan is built on this ancient city)  was the tenth-largest city in the world in the year 1000, with a population of approximately 100,000.

Muhammed's general and later Sultan of Delhi Qutb-ud-din Aybak sacked the city between 1200 and 1210, and it was destroyed by the Allauddin Khilji in 1298. The modern town of Patan later sprung up near the ruins of Anhilwara. During 1304 to 1411, first Patan was the Suba headquarter of Delhi Sultanate and capital city of the Gujarat Sultanate after the collapse of the Delhi Sultanate at the end of the 14th century. A new fort was built by these Subas, a large portion of which (along with a few of the gates) is still intact. The old fort of the Hindu kingdom is nearly vanished and only a wall can be seen on the way from Kalka to Rani ki vav. In 1411, Sultan Ahmed Shah moved the capital to Ahmedabad.
Patan was part of the Baroda state from the mid-18th century until India's independence in 1947, when Baroda became part of Bombay state, which in 1960 was separated into Gujarat and Maharashtra.
The braveness of the Vanaraja Sinh is visible from the fact that he built the state capital on planes of north Gujarat. No hill tops, no huge fortifying. It was said that during his tenure western and northern India has no similar power axis.


== Rani ki vav ==

During the period of the Chaulukya dynasty or Solanki's of Patan, the stepwell called the Rani ki vav or Ran-ki vav (Queen's step well) was constructed. It is a richly sculptured monument, built by Udaymati in memory of her husband, Bhima I (1022-1063).It was probably completed by Udaymati and Karna after his death. A reference to Udaymati building the monument is in the 'Prabandha-Chintamani' composed by Merutunga Suri in 1304 AD.

It was one of the largest and the most sumptuous structures of its type. It became silted up and much of it is not visible, except for some rows of sculptured panels in the circular part of the well. Among its ruins one pillar still stands which is proof of the elegance of its design and an excellent example of this period. A part of the west well is extant from which it appears that the wall had been built of brick and faced with stone. From this wall project vertical bracket in pairs, this supported the galleries of the well shaft proper. This bracketing is arranged in tiers and is richly carved.
There is a small gate below the last step of the step well which has a 30 km tunnel (now it has been blocked by stones and mud) which leads to the town of Sidhpur near Patan. It was used as an escape gateway for king who built the step well in the times of defeat.
This stepwell is the oldest and the deepest among the 120 other stepwell in Gujarat. The sculpture of Rani ki vav depicting Lord Vishnu's avatars, Hindu Goddesses, Jain idols and their ancestors. Most of the sculpture is in devotion to Vishnu, in the forms of his avatars (Krishna, Rama and others), representing their return to the world.
Around 50â€“60 years back there used to be ayurvedic plants around this areas which causes the water accumulated in Rani ni vav to be helpful for viral disease, fever.
It was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites on 22 June 2014.
