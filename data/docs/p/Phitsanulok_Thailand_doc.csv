Phitsanulok (Thai: พิษณุโลก, pronounced [pʰít.sā.nú.lôːk] listen ) is an important, historic city in lower northern Thailand and is the capital of Phitsanulok Province, which stretches all the way to the Laotian border. Phitsanulok is one of the oldest cities in Thailand, founded over 600 years ago. It is best known as the birthplace of King Naresuan, who freed the country from Burmese domination in the late 16th century, and that of his brother and successor King Ekathosarot (Sanphet III). As the crossroad between the northern and central regions of the country, it has long been important both for political and strategic reasons, and was fought over many times in centuries past. Phitsanulok was the capital of Thailand for 25 years during the reign of King Boromma Trailokanat of Ayutthaya. On the banks of the Nan River, the city was originally a small Khmer outpost known as Song Kwae, before the Khwae Noi River changed its course in the 11th century CE.  Phitsanulok was also a provincial center of the Angkorian Empire during the Angkorian period. Phitsanulok is home to Naresuan University and Pibulsongkram Rajabhat University, as well as to a major Royal Thai Army base.


== Etymology ==

Song Khwae: The first element, song, means the number 'two'.  The second element, khwae, means 'tributary', hence 'two rivers'.
Phitsanulok: The first element, Phitsanu (Thai:  พิษณุ; Sanskrit: viṣṇu विष्णु "Vishnu"), is a cognate of 'Vishnu', a Hindu god (see, e.g., Witnu, Thai:  วิษณุ).  Lack of a v sound in the Thai language accounts for the two forms. The second element, lok (Thai:  โลก; Sanskrit: loka लोक 'world') means 'globe' or 'world'.  A loose translation of the entire name would be 'Vishnu's heaven'.

== History ==


=== Khmer Empire ===
During the 11th century, the city of Phitsanulok was only a small Khmer outpost called Song Khwae, meaning two rivers. At that time, the Nan and Khwae Noi Rivers both flowed through the city, making it a strategic gateway to northern Thailand. The Thais were the majority in the area, however, and would soon establish their independence and form the Kingdom of Sukhothai.

Wat Ratchaburana and Wat Nang Phaya were all built during the reign of King Borommatrailokanat.
King Borommatrailokanat's successor, Boromma Ratchathirat III, returned the capital of the Ayutthaya kingdom to Ayutthaya.
In 1555, King Naresuan the Great was born in the city.
Phitsanulok was a major place of recruitment during Ayutthaya's wars with Burma.
Mother-of-pearl inlaid doors were made in 1756 for the entrance to Wat Phra Sri Rattana Mahathat at the order of King Boromakot.
After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767 and the death of its last ruler, a mad monk proclaimed himself king and seized control of Phitsanulok from its royal governor. King Taksin the Great was himself wounded by a musket ball during an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city from the monk. The monk later fled to the north.

In 1990, the regional campuses became independent universities, and the Phitsanuloke campus was named after Phitsanulok-born King Naresuan the Great.
Naresuan Dam was constructed from 1976 to 1985 on the Nan River as part of the Phitsanulok Irrigation Project. The dam was designed to help prevent flooding of the city.
