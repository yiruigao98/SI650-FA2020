Protaras (Greek: Πρωταράς; Turkish: Protaras) is a predominantly tourist resort which comes under the administrative jurisdiction of Paralimni Municipality in Cyprus. In ancient times, where Protaras is now located, stood the old city-state of Leukolla. The city possessed a small safe harbour where Demetrius Poliorketes sought refuge in the year 306 BC, lying in wait for Ptolemy, one of the successors of Alexander the Great. In the ensuing battle, Ptolemy was defeated and fled to Egypt, leaving Cyprus in the hands of Demetrius for a short time. Protaras is also referred to as "the land of windmills", maintaining the nostalgic quality of the past.
Protaras has clear sky-blue waters and sandy beaches, the most well-known of which is Fig Tree Bay. Building on the success of Ayia Napa, located about 10 km (6 mi) southwest, it has expanded into a modern holiday resort of considerable size with tens of high capacity hotels, hotel apartments, villas, restaurants, pubs and associated facilities. Being quieter than Ayia Napa and having less of a club scene, it has a reputation of catering more for family and Cypriot tourism.
