Pontedera  (Italian: [ponteˈdɛːra]; Latin: Pons Herae) is an industrial town in the province of Pisa, Tuscany, central Italy. It houses the headquarters of the Piaggio company, of the  wine company Castellani  and of chocolate factory Amedei.
Pontedera is in the Arno valley at the confluence of the Era River and the Arno River. Its territory is also crossed by the Scolmatore dell'Arno canal, and by the Roglio, a tributary of the Era. There is also a small lake, in the frazione of La Rotta, known as Braccini lake.
Pontedera was the seat of several historical battles. In 1369, the Milanese army of Barnabò Visconti, led by John Hawkwood, was defeated here by the Florentine troops. On 11 June 1554, Pontedera was the scene of a pyrrhic victory in the last effort by the Republic of Siena to retain its independence, when Piero Strozzi won against the Florentines. Two months later he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Marciano, an event which marked the end of the Senese independence. The football team in the town is called U.S. Città di Pontedera, and they are currently placed in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
