== History ==
The French were the first Europeans to assert any territorial rights over the Poplar Bluff area. The French held the area until 1770 when it was ceded by treaty to Spain. Spain held the area until 1802 when it was returned to France. During this time the area of Poplar Bluff, as well as all of Butler County, held almost no European settlements until 1819, when the first white settler family moved into the Poplar Bluff area. It was reported that about 300 Native Americans resided in the area at that time.
The earliest permanent settlements in what is now Butler County occurred in the early 19th century along the Natchitoches Trail, an old Native American Trail west of what is now Poplar Bluff on Ten Mile Creek and Cane Creek. Butler County was organized in 1849 and Poplar Bluff was chosen as the county seat. In 1855 the first courthouse was built and the town grew.
In 1927 a tornado leveled most of the city, especially the original business district along Main and Broadway streets. The tornado killed 98 people, tying it as the seventheenth deadliest tornado in U.S. history.Several buildings in Poplar Bluff are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Butler County Courthouse, Cynthia-Kinzer Historic District, Alfred W.
