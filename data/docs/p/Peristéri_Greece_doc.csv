== History ==


=== Early years and rise ===
The club began play in the 1971–72 season. In the 1982–83 season, Peristeri Athens won the second level of pro Greek basketball, which was at that time, the Greek B League. In the 1988–89 season, Peristeri won the new Greek 2nd Division championship. In the following season, of 1989–90, Peristeri played games for the first time, in the top-tier level Greek League.
In the subsequent years in that era, the team was very successful, and many well-known basketball players played for the club. During this era, Peristeri competed in the European 3rd-tier level FIBA Korać Cup 7 times (in the seasons 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 1996–97, 1997–98, and 1999–00). Well-known players such as Marko Jarić, Milan Gurović, Angelos Koronios, Michalis Pelekanos, Kostas Tsartsaris, and Alphonso Ford played for the club in that era.
In the 2000–01 season, led by the great scorer Ford, Peristeri finished in second place in the Greek League, in the regular season. The club also competed in the European 1st-tier level EuroLeague competition, during the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons. In the 2002–03 season, Peristeri competed in the European 4th-tier level FIBA EuroCup Challenge. In the 2003–04 season, the club played in the European 3rd-tier level FIBA EuroChallenge.


=== Decline ===
Following the 2003–04 season, Peristeri was downgraded to the Greek B League, due to great financial troubles within the Peristeri Sports Club. For the 2007–08 season, Peristeri Athens returned to the A2 Division, after finishing in second place in the Greek B League, in the 2006–07 season. Cezary Trybański signed with the team for the 2007–08 season. After the 2012–13 Greek Basket League season, Peristeri was again relegated to the Greek A2 League. Due to economic issues, the club did not take part in the A2 League in the following season, and instead competed in the Greek B League (the 3rd division of the Greek basketball league system).In the 2014–15 season, Peristeri finished in 4th place, in the 1st group of the Greek B League. Nevertheless, due to the withdrawal of Panionios from the Greek A2 League, Peristeri was promoted back to the A2 League, as they replaced Panionios in the competition.


=== On the rise again ===
In the 2017–18 season, Peristeri won its third A2 League championship. The team broke the league's win/loss record during the season, and finished with a record of 29 wins and just 1 loss. Thus, the club was promoted to the Greek Basket League for the 2018–19 season. The club joined one of the two European-wide secondary leagues, the FIBA Champions League, for the 2019–20 season. The team had a successful season, managing to progress in the round of 16 of Basketball Champions League, where the team was eliminated by powerhouse Hapoel Jerusalem B.C. Peristeri stands in third position of the Greek Basket League
