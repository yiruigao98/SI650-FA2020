Praga-North (Polish: Praga-Północ, Polish pronunciation: [ˈpraɡa ˈpuwnɔt͡s]) is a district in Warsaw located in the central part of the city.


== History ==
Praga is one of the oldest districts in Warsaw. Through the centuries, Warsaw's right-bank was an independent town. In 1648 it was granted municipal rights by the king Władysław IV Vasa. It was joined to Warsaw at the end of 18th century. In 1945 it was divided into Praga-North and Praga-South (Praga-Południe).
Praga North is a district that survived the devastation of war, with three different religions (Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Judaism) peacefully co-existing. A major part of the buildings in this area have preserved its historical origins which makes it one of the best-preserved area of old buildings in the capital. In the district there are many streets which remained undamaged in WW II. Pre-war lamp-posts, sidewalks and blocks are notable features of the area.
At present, Praga North has an area of 11.42km2, and 64 904 inhabitants (2018). The district is becoming increasingly popular among artists and tourists.
