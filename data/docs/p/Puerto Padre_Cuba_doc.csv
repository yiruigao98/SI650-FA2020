Puerto Padre (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpweɾto paðɾe]) is a municipality and town in the Las Tunas Province of Cuba. It is located on the northern coastal region of the province, in an estuary (Estero El Espanolito) that opens into the Puerto Padre Bay.


== History ==
Known popularly as the City of Mills, Puerto Padre has a history dating back into the 16th century. In the mid-19th century (1851), the city began its transformation from a small town into an industrial centre with the construction of its first sugarcane mill. The town played a large role in Cuba's wars of independence, and today is something of a tourist centre. The founders were Criollo(Creole) landowners of Castilian ancestry and Catalan merchants.


=== Columbus' arrival point theory ===
During the 2nd half of the 20th century a group of archaeologists brought forward a theory which disputes the current version of Columbus' landfall site. They claim that Puerto Padre bay was indeed the first spot in which Columbus landed in Cuba. The commonly accepted site is Bariay bay which is located further east in the province of Holguín. There are several sites which are disputed of being the first landing spot of Columbus and his crew: Puerto Padre and Manatí, both in the province of Las Tunas; and Gibara and Bariay in the province of Holguín).
