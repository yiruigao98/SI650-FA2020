== Energy ==

The City of Summerside operates the only municipally-owned electric utility in Prince Edward Island.  After buying Charlottetown Light & Power in 1918, Maritime Electric consolidated electric distribution on the island. The company offered to take over the operations in Summerside, but backed down after citizens rejected various offers. The Summerside distribution grid has had an inter-connection with the Maritime Electric transmission grid since 1961.Similar to Maritime Electric, Summerside Electric purchases the majority of its electricity from NB Power. In 2008, 76.5% of its power was acquired from NB Power. Although the Summerside Electric Commission has its own diesel engines at the Harvard Street Generating Station which can operate for several days independently of NB Power's supply, it is only used in exceptional circumstances such as when the NB Power or Maritime Electric transmission grids that feed the city are interrupted. They also run their engines on the last day of every month, for maintenance reasons and they sell that power back to NB Power.
In 2007 the city signed a 20-year agreement with a private wind energy company to supply about 23% of its electricity from a private wind farm in West Cape.Construction started on a city owned wind farm in 2009 comprising four wind turbines, each capable of producing 3 megawatts of electricity.  The wind farm became fully operational in late 2009 and was immediately tied into the city's power.  This is Canada's first municipally owned and operated wind farm.  On an average day the wind farm produces about 25% of the electricity for the entire city.  At times when electricity usage in the city is low and the winds are high the wind farm has potential to produce more power than the city consumes.
The city is a supporter of clean electric vehicles.  As of September 2013 there are over 10 electric car charging stations in the city with another 30 to be installed in the coming months.  There are more charging stations per capita in Summerside than any other city in Canada.
