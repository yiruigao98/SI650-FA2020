Pulheim (pronunciation ) is a city in the Rhein-Erft-Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Since the 1920s, a large substation of the Rheinisch-Westfälisches Elektrizitätswerk AG (RWE) is located at Pulheim. It is the end of the north south powerline and a large control center for the power grid of the RWE.
In the communal reform of 1975, several previously independent municipalities were added to the municipality Pulheim, which received city rights in 1981.
