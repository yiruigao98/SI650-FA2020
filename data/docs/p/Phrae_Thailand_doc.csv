Phrae (Thai: แพร่; pronounced [pʰrɛ̂ː]; Northern Thai: ) is one of Thailand's seventy-six provinces (changwat) lies in upper northern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Phayao, Nan, Uttaradit, Sukhothai, and Lampang.


== Geography ==
Phrae is in the valley of the Yom River. The Phi Pan Nam Range runs across the province from north to south in the west. The Phlueng Range is in the east.


== History ==
The history of Phrae dates back to the Haripunchai kingdom of the Mon. It became part of the Lan Na in 1443, when King Tilokaraj was on an expedition to capture Nan.


== Symbols ==
Provincial seal: According to legend the two cities of Phrae and Nan were once ruled by brothers. When they met to divide the land between them the one from Phrae rode on a horse, the one from Nan on a buffalo to the meeting point on top of a mountain. Hence Phrae uses a horse in their seal, while Nan uses a buffalo. When the provincial government proposed the seal in 1940, the Fine Arts Department suggested adding a historic building to the seal in addition to the horse, thus it now has the stupa of Phra Tat Cho Hae on the back of the horse. This temple is about nine kilometers southeast of the city of Phrae.
The provincial flower and tree is the Burmese Almondwood (Chukrasia tabularis).


== Human achievement index 2017 ==
