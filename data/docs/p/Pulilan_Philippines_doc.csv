== Etymology ==
In the beginning, Pulilan is neither its name nor a town.  History has it that the place is a marshy or swampland which forms part of Pampanga, along the Candaba Bay. Because of the vastness of its area, Pulilan was created out of the districts of Baliuag and Quingua (now Plaridel) and coming from the Pampango word "Kengwa", meaning on the other side of the shore or kabilang ibayo. In 1794, the place was named San Isidro by the missionary Augustinian friars in honor of San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of the farmers. On January 20, 1796, it was called Pulilan. There are no written records how the place is named Pulilan. But legend has it that is derived from Pulo ng Ilan, literally, clusters of small communities or isles. According to Antoon Postma in his "The Laguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI) – A Valuable Philippine Document" this copperplate with inscription discovered at Lumbang River near the Laguna Lake area in Laguna dates back to 900 A.D. In this inscription was mentioned the name Puliran, as the old name for southeastern lake area. The toponyms or place names Puliran is Pulilan, Bulacan and Pulilan is in Laguna de Bay. However, Mr. Postma is convinced in his studies that Pulilan in the LCI is the Pulilan along the Angat River, in the Province of Bulacan, north of Manila.


== History ==

The first time Pulilan was settled was unknown but if existing records of the towns of Calumpit and Baliuag, between which the town lies, be made a basis, it could be deduced that in the early part of the 17th century it could have had a sprinkling of settlers. However, the ancient town of Pulilan was first documented as Puliran in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, a pre-colonial oldest document of Philippines written in 900 A.D in Indianized script. The native population at the time of the document were ruled by the sovereign Lord Ka-Sumuran (see Laguna Copperplate Inscription).
During Spanish regime, an Augustian fray, Fray Vicente Villamanzaro, was made to declare the settlement of a town on January 20, 1796. It was assigned a patron saint, San Isidro Labrador, after whose name he wanted the town identified. On this time, the head of the town was called Kapitan. It was only in 1819 that Pulilan has as its first Kapitan, Kapitan Francisco Paltao. In 1898, the first Presidente Municipal was Froilan Cahiwat. In 1904, when Anacleto Batongbacal was the Presidente Municipal, Pulilan was annexed to Quingua and became its sitio. In 1908, as the Pulilenos rallied behind the candidacy of their son Adriano Salvador, he was elected Presidente Municipal of Quinqua. Then in 1909, representations were made by Eugenio Tiangco, Hilario Esguerra, Adriano Salvador and others with Governor Teodoro Sandico to separate Pulilan from Quingua. It was granted.  Pulilan then became a town, with Eugenio Tiangco as its Presidente. In 1946, Catalino Flores was appointed as the first Mayor of Pulilan.
From the Spanish time to American occupation and lately the Japanese era, many sons of the town of Pulilan shed their blood. After long march to freedom, Pulilenos started to build from its small beginnings and from then on made a great stride in politics, economy, social standing and in other fields. The influence of the Spanish, American and Japanese occupations, have in a measure, contributed to the promotion of their welfare, but the Pulileños, as they are known, treasure their great heritage. San Isidro Labrador or Saint Isidore the Laborer, the patron saint of the farmers, is the patron saint of the town as well. The traditional date of his liturgical feast, which through not included in the General Roman Calendar has been celebrated for centuries in several countries and diocese is May 15. However, it is in the 14th day of May that Pulileños (people of Pulilan) celebrate the feast in honor of their saint by parading carabaos and making them kneel in front of the church as a sign of respect for their patron saint of farmers. Also included in the parade are cows, horses, street folk dancers, marching bands and floats of commercial establishments of the town.
