== History ==
Planaltina had already become a municipality in 1981, but with the installation of the Federal District in 1960 it lost part of its territory, including the municipal seat. As a consequence a new city had to be built, which for some time was called Brasilinha. The traditional Planaltina became a satellite city of Brasília.
The site chosen for the new Planaltina was the farmhouse Brasília belonging to Joaquim Gonçalves, known as Joaquim Mineiro. In 1967 the city hall was built and it was given the name Planaltina after a plebiscite carried out in the same year.
The early years were similar to those of the development of Brasília, with the cerrado being cleaned and wooden shacks being put up.  The similarity with Brasília was such that people would say "they are building a little Brasília, a Brasilinha, thus baptizing the new city.
The first plan envisioned 22 thousand lots that would each house 5 persons.  In fewer than 30 years the population had reached 80 thousand  inhabitants.  Much of the population explosion came about because of the construction of Brasília.  A massive migratory wave came to the  federal capital and there was no space in the original plan.  The military government at the time would not allow these families to squat on federal lands and sent the excess population to Planaltina.
Planaltina gave up most of its territory including its municipal seat to form the new Federal District, but never received any indemnification for this loss.  See History of Planaltina


== Planaltina or Planaltina de Goiás? ==
There is a certain amount of confusion about what the name of the city is.  In the IBGE/Seplan statistics it is listed as Planaltina.  In Telelistas it is called Planaltina de Goiás but has Planaltina as the name in the webpage.  See Telelistas-Planaltina.  On the Portuguese version on Wikipedia  the article is titled "Planaltina" but the table refers to "Planaltina de Goiás".  Just to confuse matters more the Prefeitura calls itself "Planaltina".  See Planaltina.go.
