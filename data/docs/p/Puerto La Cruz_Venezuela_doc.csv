== History ==
The history of this settlement began with the arrival of the Spanish to the northern coast of what would eventually become Venezuela.
In 1780, the Christian Mission of Pozuelos (English: small wells) was founded by indigenous natives.
On 9 April 1862, a group of 26 families from Margarita Island decided to settle in Pozuelos Bay. As time progressed, this settlement adopted the Virgen del Amparo (English: Virgin of Amparo) and the Holy Cross (Spanish: Santa Cruz) as their religious symbols, celebrating their patron saint on 8 November (Spanish: Dia de la Virgen del Amparo) and iconography on 3 May (Spanish: Dia de la Santa Cruz).
By 1868 the first church was built, and slowly the name of the town was changed to Puerto de la Santa Cruz (English: Port of the Holy Cross), later shortened to Puerto La Cruz.


== Economy ==
Puerto La Cruz is home to Puerto La Cruz refinery, one of the largest oil refineries in the country, which, with its 200,000 barrels (32,000 m3) per day processing capacity, supplies the domestic market and exports to other Caribbean countries such as Cuba and the Antilles.  Also, at 50 kilometres (31 mi), José Plant is one of the primary processing facilities of the largest Venezuelan oil company, PDVSA and is a major refining hub for the crude extracted in the states of Monagas and Anzoátegui.
Puerto La Cruz is the terminus of the 145 km (90 mi) Carapito-Puerto la Cruz oil pipeline, the 155 km (96 mi) San Joaquin-Puerto la Cruz oil pipeline and the 184 km (114 mi) Anaco-Puerto la Cruz gas pipeline.The city is the gateway to a large national park. The beaches of Mochima National Park surround the city.  Places such as Isla de Plata, Playa Conoma, Isla Arapo and Playa Arapito are known for their beauty.
To the west of the city is the terminal of one of the main ferry lines linking Isla Margarita with the mainland, while to the east is a private marina that caters for tourists and visitors. Day trips are available to visit national park islands such as Playa El Faro, Los Chimanas, Cachicamo and Isla Borracha.
In addition to tourism, the major international banks have established their regional headquarters in the city. A large number of commercial businesses, and large shopping centers are progressively being developed.


== Transportation ==

Large avenues cross the city, from north to south, and from east to west. Among them are:

Av. Municipal, which is the main avenue of the city, with two main traffic lanes and 2 service lanes in each direction, and was the first to be paved.
Av. 5 Julio is the most popular avenue for trade; most shops are owned by immigrants of Arab descent.
Av. Paseo Colon; almost all of this avenue borders the Bay of Pozuelos, which is one of the largest bays in the world. It has a boulevard where the symbol of the city of Puerto La Cruz (the Holy Cross) is situated. In addition here are established known hotels.

Margarita Island can be reached by the transport service operated by Conferry and Gran Cacique Express (which resumed its activities in December 2006). The beaches located on the islands of Mochima National Park may also be reached from Lechería.
In Guaraguao, Puerto La Cruz, there is also a terminal for the export/import of the crude oil processed at the city's refinery.
Puerto La Cruz does not have its own airport and uses Generál José Antonio Anzoátegui International Airport, in the nearby city of Barcelona.


== Mass transportation ==

According to various sources, local authorities are awaiting the signature of President Hugo Chávez after negotiating an agreement between the mayors of Puerto La Cruz (Sotillo Municipality) and Barcelona (Bolivar Municipality) and the Chinese company Transtech Engineering Corporation for the construction of a network of modern mass transportation. The target date for the launch of this initiative was August 2007, but since the announcement in March of that year has not been re-appointed over the project.
The first phase of construction of the Metro urban network is expected to last approximately two years to complete. According to various estimates, this would reduce by 50% the volume of traffic that is logged daily in this metropolitan area. This ambitious project involves an air transport infrastructure, with additional sections on land.
