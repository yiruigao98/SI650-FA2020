Puerto Asís (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpweɾto aˈsis]) is a Colombian city in Putumayo Department. It is located on the west bank of the Putumayo River, downstream from the mouth of the Guamués River, 75 km by road south of (Cardinal) Mocoa.

== History ==
Puerto Asís was founded on May 3, 1912 by the Capuchins Missionaries, led by Father Estanislao de las Cortes and Brother Hidelfonso de Tulcán. The city bears the name of Saint Francis's birthplace—Assisi.
In order to reaffirm the sovereignty of Colombia in the territories that were contested by Peru, the government located programs in the region that contributed to the town's growth.
By April 1914, the village had a population of more than 200; however, excluding children, women, or indigenous people. The population continued to increase. The mission opened a boarding school for the education of the local indigenous population and the colonists' children. Later that same year, The Franciscan Sisters took charge of the school.
The city celebrates Carnival each year in January, beginning with a Tyre Regatta on January 3 in the Putumayo River. This became a major tourist attraction.
