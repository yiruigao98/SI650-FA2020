== Rewari bypass ==
To create connectivity between NH 11 and NH 48 (Delhi-Jaipur national highway), a new stretch of NH 11 is being constructed bypassing Rewari city. The existing junction of NH 352 (Rohtak-Jhajjar-Rewari national highway) with NH 48 (Delhi-Jaipur national highway) will be the terminus or starting point of NH 11. The new alignment of NH 11 between NH 48 and Narnaul will bypass south of Rewari city and meet the existing Rewari-Narnaul road near Khori railway station. Thus vehicles going to or from Narnaul will not have to enter Rewari city.
