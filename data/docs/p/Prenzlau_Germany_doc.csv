Prenzlau (German: [ˈpʁɛnt͡slaʊ] (listen), formerly also Prenzlow) is a town in Brandenburg, Germany, the administrative seat of Uckermark District. It is also the centre of the historic Uckermark region.


== Geography ==
The town is located on the Ucker river, about 100 km (62 mi) north of Berlin. Prenzlau station -- which opened in 1863 -- is a stop on the Angermünde–Stralsund railway line.


== History ==
Settled since Neolithic times, the Prenzlau area from the 7th century AD was the site of several gords erected by the Polabian Slavs. In the late 12th century, the Dukes of Pomerania had the region colonized by Low German settlers.
Prenzlau itself, named after Slavic Premyslaw was first mentioned in 1187. It received town privileges by Duke Barnim I of Pomerania in 1234. When Duke Barnim signed the Treaty of Landin with the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in 1250, Prenzlau was already a fortified town with walls and moats, four parish churches and a monastery. Together with Berlin-Cölln, Frankfurt and Stendal, it ranked among the largest towns in the margraviate.
The Prenzlau and the Uckermark region were devastated during the Thirty Years' War. From the late 17th century onwards French Huguenot refugees settled here and an economic recovery started. Also a garrison town, Prenzlau was again ravaged by passing troops during the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars. In the mid 19th century, several citizens emigrated to Australia, where they founded the town of Prenzlau, Queensland west of Brisbane.
In World War II the Oflag II-A is a prisoner-of-war camp located just south of Prenzlau on the main road to Berlin. The town centre was largely destroyed. The East German authorities had it rebuilt with large panel Plattenbau buildings.
