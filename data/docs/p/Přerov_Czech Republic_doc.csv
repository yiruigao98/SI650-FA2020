== History ==
Settlement in the locality dates back to prehistoric times. There is a world—renowned prehistoric site from the stone age on the mound called Hradisko in Přerov Předmostí. The oldest written reference to Přerov dates to 1141 when bishop Jindřich Zdík mentioned Přerov's church of St. George as one of the most important ones in Moravia. King Ottokar II of Bohemia gave Přerov the privilege of being a royal town in 1256. The mansion of Přerov, built in place of the former castle, was a residence of an influential house, the house of Pernštejn and Žerotín, from which Charles the Elder of Žerotín significantly influenced the town. Přerov also plays an important role in history of the Czech protestant church known as Unity of the Brethren.
The town grew the most in 19th century after a railway line was built through it first from Vienna to Olomouc, later extended to Prague.
In June 1945, during the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia, 71 men, 120 women and 74 children were killed in an illegal massacre of the German population.German terror in Bohemia and Moravia peaked in Spring 1945 sparking a Czech uprising, which started in Přerov on May 1 and then spread throughout the whole country after the murder of 78,154 Czech Jews and 340,000 Czech citizens during the German occupation.
