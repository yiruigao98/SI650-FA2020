=== Jewish community ===

In the 19th and early 20th centuries Jewish immigrants to the Baltimore area first formed enclaves in East Baltimore not far from Johns Hopkins Hospital in neighborhoods such as Broadway East, Jonestown, Middle East and Oliver. After World War II, the Jewish community started to move outside of Baltimore City into Pikesville which was a sleepy outpost on a major road that led to Western Maryland. During the Vietnam War, and exacerbated by riots in 1968, many Jewish businesses left northwestern Baltimore following this exodus.
Pikesville (and more recently its neighboring communities to the north, Owings Mills and Reisterstown) have been considered the center of the Baltimore area's Jewish community since the mid-1950s (referred to by residents as "100,000 Jews in three zip codes"). Many of the region's largest and most established synagogues and Jewish schools are located in or near Pikesville.


== History ==
Pikesville was named for the American soldier and explorer Zebulon Pike (1779–1813). While there are places named for Pike in many other states, Pikesville, Maryland, is the only contemporary place named "Pikesville" (compare Pikeville, Kentucky).
The (historic) town of Pikesville, incorporated August, 1818, in Barren County, Kentucky, was apparently named for Zebulon Pike, also.  In 1858, the community adopted a new postal name, “Flippin, Kentucky,” to avoid confusion with Pikeville, Kentucky.  “Pike[s]ville Branch” of Indian Creek is the only remaining physical landmark of historic Pikesville, in Kentucky, along with a colorful story of an almost forgotten past.
