== History ==


=== 10th century ===
In the middle of the 10th century, Mollet was a little center of population that depended on the bishop of Barcelona.

Of the medieval past of Mollet, there is only remaining the Romanesque church of Santa Maria de Gallecs


=== From 15th to 18th centuries ===
Mollet (which back then also included Parets) didn't raise the population until the 17th century, then, a new church was built, but as ruling a town with 3 churches was hard, there were constant conflicts, which concluded with the separation of Parets.
