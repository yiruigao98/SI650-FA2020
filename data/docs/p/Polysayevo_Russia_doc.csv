He won in a number of competitions, and in 1984 received the title of a candidate in master of sports. During training camps Tinkoff first took up black marketeering, buying hard-to-find goods in Central Asia, and selling them in Leninsk-Kuznetsky. His cycling career was interrupted by military service: he did not get in the Sports Club of the army and was sent to the border troops. In 1986–1988 he served in the Far East – in Nakhodka and Nikolayevsk-on-Amur.


=== University ===

Oleg traded on jeans, cosmetics and perfumery, caviar and vodka. He sold goods from St. Petersburg in Siberia, and from there he brought Japanese household appliances purchased from the miners. He brought electrical appliances to Poland and got back from there with office equipment and supplies, gas cartridges and guns.He traded together with his future wife and fellow students – Oleg Zherebtsov (later – the founder of shops network Lenta), Oleg Leonov (future founder of shops network DIXY) and Andrey Rogachev (founder of the company LEC and Pyaterochka).In the third year, Oleg left the Mining Institute. In 1999, he continued his education at the University of California, Berkeley and did a six-month extension program of marketing.

== Entrepreneurship ==


=== Technoshock ===
In 1992, Oleg Tinkoff began wholesale electronics trade from Singapore and to simplify the registration of documents he registered a limited liability partnership Petrosib in St. Petersburg, and then regional companies Petrosib-Kemerovo, Petrosib-Novosibirsk and Petrosib-Omsk and others. Goods arrived in St. Petersburg and from there went to the regions, where they were sold with a larger markup. He started with calculators and went on to the office equipment, televisions, VCRs and even artificial flowers and trees. In the beginning, Oleg himself flew to Singapore, then began to use air transport, but the turning point came when an Indian dealer Ashok Vasmani shipped him half container TVs on credit. Tinkoff went on to container transportation.Reduced profits from wholesale pushed Tinkoff towards launching his own store network. In 1994 Petrosib opened the first store under the Sony label on Maly Prospect of Vasilevsky Island in St. Petersburg. Then – another one at Marata Street. Petrosib USA opened in San Francisco. Success in retail inspired Tinkoff to combine shops under one name. Technoshock was opened in 1995 and offered expensive household appliances at the highest prices in the city, but still it was popular. Technoshock was one of the first companies in Russia which began to train its sales consultants. Sergio Gutsalenko, an American of Russian origin, became the President of the company. The network grew rapidly: by 1996 the Technoshock had five stores in St. Petersburg, two in Omsk and Kemerovo and one in Novorossiysk. From 1995 to 1996 the turnover doubled and reached $40 million.By 1997 in St. Petersburg there were Eldorado stores which increased competition and reduced profitability. In 1997 Oleg Tinkoff sold the company to its management, and a year later it was acquired by Simteks. Oleg came out of the Technoshock with $7 million and invested the sum in the pelmeni business.Along with Technoshock Tinkoff opened a network of music stores Music Shock in 1996. Philipp Kirkorov and Alla Pugacheva performed at the opening of the first Music Shock, Jeanne Aguzarova – at the second.Together with Ilya Bortnyuk, Tinkoff launched Shock Records record label. The label released debut albums of bands Kirpichi, Leningrad, Vladimir Dashkevich Symphony based on his music for the film Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the album Nechelovek-vidimka by Knife for Frau Müller. Music Shock published a 320-page book Viktor Tsoi, composed by Victor’s widow Mariana Tsoi and Alexey Rybin, musician of Kino band.
In 1998 Music Shock was sold to the Moscow company Gala Records.


=== Daria ===
Pelmeni and other frozen foods were produced under the brand name Daria, named after the daughter of Oleg Tinkoff. A Greek called Athanasius, who distributed ravioli production equipment in Russia, gave Tinkoff this idea while in the sauna. Production was launched in early 1998 in Peterhof and in the beginning it made products under the trademark Smak under license from Andrey Makarevich company. After the conflict with the licensor, the brand name changed to Smak St. Petersburg. Economic crisis was the reason to create its own brand: the new brand helped increase the market share. The new plant, which opened in December 1998, at the site of a former Technoshock warehouse on Predportovaya street in St. Petersburg, originally produced only Daria. In addition, Tinkoff made products under the brands of Tolsty kok, Dobry product and Tsar-batyushka.Daria got its first popularity thanks to the advertising campaign, in which five billboards in St. Petersburg and two in Moscow showed an image of female buttocks covered with flour and the caption Your favorite pelmeni!. In another commercial there was a phrase From these raviolek you’ll get stomach cramps, which caused Ravioli company dissatisfaction. In return they used a phrase Daria, shoo! in their advertisement campaign.In 2001, the Daria was sold to Roman Abramovich and Andrew Bloch holding company Planeta Management for $21 million, of which 7 were used to pay off credit debt.


=== Tinkoff Beer ===

In 1997 Tinkoff could not find an investor for the construction of a brewery. Two meetings helped: an equipment supplier, with whom Tinkoff met at the exhibition Drinktec in Munich, proposed to combine the brewery with a restaurant and focus on the development of the brand and the other supplier – suggested that beer would be called after the family name according to the Bavarian tradition.The initial investment amounted to one million Deutschmarks, and in August 1998 the first restaurant was opened in St. Petersburg on Kazanskaya street, 7. There soon appeared a line for beer in bottles. In 2001 the restaurant was opened in Moscow in Protochny lane, the investment in which amounted to $2 million. The restaurant was opened in Samara in November 2002, in Novosibirsk – in January 2003, then there were restaurants in Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Vladivostok and Sochi.The first plant was built by the summer of 2003 with the support of the bank Zenith which opened a credit line for Tinkoff brewery. For construction of the second plant the company raised the funds through a bond issue, as well as the bank Zenit loans and the German HypoVereinsbank. The second plant worth about $75 million was completely built on credit funds.Tinkoff factories produced Tinkoff beer, Tekiza, and T. While expanding, the company invested significant funds in mass marketing. There was even a bad experience of collaboration with photographer and director Oliviero Toscani, author of the United Colors of Benetton advertising campaigns.Since 2004 Sun Interbrew group showed interest in acquisition of Tinkoff plants, and in 2005 it took place. It paid about $200 million for factory and brand. After that Tinkoff sold the premises of Tinkoff restaurants to the management company Troika Dialog for about $10–12 million and at the same time he signed a long-term lease of the same premises. Finally in 2008–2009 the restaurants themselves were acquired by Mint Capital equity fund.


=== Tinkoff Bank ===

On November 18, 2005, at Necker Island, owned by billionaire Richard Branson, Oleg Tinkov presented a draft of the future bank. In 2006 he acquired the Moscow Himmashbank and based on it created a bank with a remote service, which was first in Russia. Despite the setbacks in attracting investment at the start of the project, during the crisis of 2008 the bank showed a 50-fold increase in profits.Tinkoff Credit Systems reduced costs at the expense of marketing which was non-standard for the banking sector and the widespread use of computer processing of the data instead of human labor. For a long time the bank did not attract deposits and used its own capital for lending.The developed technology platform played a major role: the IPO of the bank was one of the largest deals in 2013 Russian version of Forbes, and Oleg Tinkoff doubled his fortune and took 1210 position in the world ranking of billionaires.In the beginning of 2015 Tinkoff Credit Systems changed its name to Tinkoff Bank. A more simple and concise name is intended to better reflect the full range of financial institution services.As of February 2020 Tinkoff owns 44% shares of the bank, and it remains his main project.
