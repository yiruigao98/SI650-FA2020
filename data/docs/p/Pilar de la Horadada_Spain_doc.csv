== History ==

The town has been the site of many battles because of its location at the historical frontier between two kingdoms: the Kingdom of Murcia (Castilla) and the Kingdom of Valencia. Pilar de la Horadada was a town with dry farms and few houses known as Campo de la Horadada. After various centuries of agricultural economy, its tourism breakthrough came with its independence from the Orihuela municipal district in 1986. Co-operative societies such as 'Surinver' and 'Teresa Hermanos' use many of the local fields for vegetable growing. Pilar de la Horadada lies between the sea and the mountains and has a Mediterranean climate.
