== History ==
The origins of Piracanjuba go back to the nineteenth century when Padre Marinho began a settlement called Pouso Alto.  A chapel was built in 1831 and by 1833 there were houses in the region.  In 1855 it was elevated to district with the name Nossa Senhora da Abadia do Pouso Alto. In 1886 this name was changed to Piracanjuba.  In 1907 once again the name was changed to Pouso Alto, only to return to Piracanjuba in 1943.  Piracanjuba comes from the name of the river and a fish in the region.  Later two districts, Cromínia and Mairipotaba, were dismembered to form separate municipalities.


== Origin of the name ==
The name "Piracanjuba" is derived from the fish with the same name (Triurobrycon lundii), which was once common in river waters of this region. ambientebrasil
