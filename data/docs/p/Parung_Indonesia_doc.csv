KRL Commuterline, or commonly known as Commuterline or KRL by Indonesians, is a commuter rail system for Greater Jakarta in Indonesia. It was previously known as KRL Jabodetabek.
It is operated by PT Kereta Commuter Indonesia, trading as KAI Commuter, a subsidiary of the Indonesian national railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI). The name of the operator changed from previous PT KAI Commuter Jabodetabek (KCJ) since 19 September 2017. 
The rail system uses rolling stock of rapid transit standard and operates at high frequency with a minimum headway. In 2019, the average number of KRL users per day reaches average of 1.04 million, with a record of the highest number of users served in one day is 1,154,080.


== History ==


=== Colonial era ===
In 1917, a plan to introduce electrified railway in Batavia was made by Staatspoorwegen (SS), Dutch colonial railways company. The railway between Tanjung Priok to Meester Cornelis (Jatinegara) was the first line to be electrified. The construction began in 1923 and completed on 24 December 1924. The line was opened on 6 April 1925—in time for the SS 50th anniversary—with 3000-series locomotives from SLM–BBC (Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works - Brown Boveri & Cie), 3100-series electric locomotives from AEG Germany, 3200-series locomotives from Werkspoor Netherlands and passenger coaches from Westinghouse and General Electric.The electrification project continued and on 1 May 1927, all rail lines that surround Batavia has been fully electrified. Batavia Zuid station (now Jakarta Kota), closed temporarily in 1926, was reopened on 8 October 1929. The last part of the electrification project, Batavia Zuid - Buitenzorg, was completed in 1930. After independence in 1945, the railway operation was taken over by DKA (Djawatan Kereta Api Repoeblik Indonesia/ Indonesian Railways Bureau, now PT Kereta Api).


=== Decline and revival ===
Transportation in Jakarta was at its lowest point during the 1960s. Tramways in Jakarta were closed in 1960 and railway traffic on Manggarai – Jakarta Kota was restricted in November 1966. The electric train services were closed in late 1965, with remaining services now powered by steam and diesel trains.On 16 May 1972, PNKA (Perusahaan Negara Kereta Api, successor of DKA) ordered 10 new sets of electric multiple units from Japan, leading to the revival of the electric train services within Greater Jakarta. The new trains, built by Nippon Sharyo, arrived in 1976 and replaced the old locomotives and coaches. Sets consisted of four cars each, with capacity of 134 passengers per car. Those new trains (commonly known as KRL Rheostatik) will continue serving the passengers in Jakarta for the next 37 years. PNKA (later PJKA and Perumka) continued importing trains from Japan, South Korea and Netherlands until the late 1990s.
In May 2000, the government of Japan via JICA and Tokyo Metropolitan Government donated 72 units of used Toei 6000 trains, formerly operating on Toei Mita Line. These were the first air-conditioned electric trains in Indonesia. The new trains were operated on 25 August 2000 for express services.


=== Commuter Line era ===

The current form of electric train service in Jakarta was begun in 2008. Jabotabek Urban Transport Division, a sub-unit of Kereta Api Indonesia that handles commuter service around Jabodetabek, spun-off to form KAI Commuterline Jabodetabek (KCJ). Ticket revenues, rolling stock maintenance, and station management was transferred to the newly formed subsidiary, but all operational matters (e.g. scheduling and dispatching), rolling stock, stations and infrastructures remained under KAI's responsibility.
The modernization of the commuter railway system, however, did not begin until 2011. In 2011, network operations were greatly simplifed from 37 point-to-point service patterns into six integrated lines (known as Loop line system) all running local, stopping at every station, as express services were abolished. Service was also simplified into two service classes: economy class (cheaper service without air conditioning, subsidized by Ministry of Transportation) and Commuter class (more expensive service with air conditioning). On 17 April 2013, the commuter line extension to Maja in the Green Line commenced operation. On 25 July 2013, the economy class was discontinued, leaving the Commuter class as the sole service class throughout the network. In July 2013, the operator introduced the Commet (Commuter Electronic Ticketing) system replacing the old paper ticket system and changing the old fare system into 'progressive fare' system, as well as modernization of all 80 serving stations.
Starting on 1 April 2015, the Nambo line extension operation is commenced.Three line extensions have been opened between 2015 and 2017: the extension of Pink Line to Tanjung Priuk station which commenced operation on 22 December 2015, the extension of Green Line to Rangkasbitung station which commenced operation on 1 April 2017, and the extension of Blue Line to Cikarang station which commenced operation on 8 October 2017. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes.Until 5 March 2014, KA Commuter Jabodetabek only operates 8-car trainsets on all lines. In 2016, the operation of 12-car trainsets commenced. As of December 2019, it operates 1,057 trips per day by 90 trains.


== Service routes ==

The modernization project in 2011 introduced 6 integrated commuter lines and 8 services which serve Greater Jakarta. The number of services has increased to 11 by 2017.
The network route map is recognized by color code and destination of final station.


== Ticketing and fares ==

Passengers may purchase ticket for single or multiple journeys. Single-journey cards (Tiket Harian Berjaminan/THB) may be purchased at any ticket counters or C-VIM vending machines, available in some stations. A Rp 10,000 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid in order to prevent losses for KCI, as many passengers do not return the single-journey cards. Passengers may recharge the card for the next trip, or refund the deposit at the ticket counter or vending machines in any Commuterline stations. However, if the card is not used or recharged for seven days, the card will expire and cannot be refunded.
Passengers may also purchase a ticket for multiple journeys (Kartu Multi-trip/KMT). KMT is priced at Rp 50,000 (including Rp 30,000 credit). The card has no expiry date and can be used with a minimum credit of Rp 5,000 after KCI introduced fare adjustment machines. Passengers who don't have enough credit in their KMT can top-up at fare adjustment machines or two-way ticket counters. Previously the minimum credit was Rp 13,000, based on the highest available fare in the system. The card may be topped up at the ticket counters or vending machines.In addition to KCJ-issued cards, passengers may also purchase bank-issued cards. Unlike KCJ-issued cards which may only be used for train fares and station's park-and-ride facilities, these cards may also be used for goods and services payments at selected merchants, gas stations, TransJakarta BRT, selected parking facilities, and toll road payments. Currently Commuterline accepts Mandiri e-Money, BRIZZI, BNI TapCash, and flazz BCA.


=== Fares ===
Fare is charged by distance traveled ('progressive fare'), Rp 3,000 for the first 25 kilometers and Rp 1,000 for every next 10 kilometers. The fare is subsidized by the Ministry of Transportation. For 2016, the government allocated Rp 1.1 trillion public service obligation to Commuterline.Prior to the introduction of distance-based fare, the fare is determined by number of stations passed. The first five stations passed is charged at Rp 3,000 and every next three stations charged at Rp 1,000. Between July and November 2013, the charges were lowered to Rp 2,000 and Rp 500 respectively, after the government subsidized the fare. Number of passengers increased by 30% after one week of introduction of the new fares.


== Stations ==

As of January 2019, there are 80 active and 4 inactive stations for KRL Commuterline. All the stations have commercial zones of various sizes for operating retail stores, chain shops, and ATM booth. The stations have prayer place, toilets and dispensary for emergency health service. Stations have manual ticket counters as well as automated ticket vending machines since 2017 . Started on 15 January 2019, all stations have free Wi-Fi service facility for passengers.

== Rolling stock ==

KRL Jabodetabek rolling stocks are composed of second-hand rail cars imported from Japan of Tokyo Metro, Toyo Rapid Railway, JR East (in which KAI Commuter has strategic partnerships with), and Tokyu Railways. All of these cars are legally classified as executive-class cars (K1). Domestically made air-conditioned cars produced by Industri Kereta Api (INKA) air-conditioned are no longer in service, although those trains will operate on Solo-Yogya commuter line in Central Java. Trains are generally formed of 8, 10, or 12 cars, with a capacity of 80–110 passengers per car. KRL CommuterLine had 1,020 cars as of July 2019.Train without air conditioning (mainly economy class) are no longer operated as KCI (the operator) begins the single-service operation of air-conditioned trainsets. One set of ex-economy class (Holec) has been retrofitted with air conditioning by INKA.
