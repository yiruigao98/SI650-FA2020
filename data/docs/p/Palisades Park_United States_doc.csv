== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Palisades Park is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 565) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The government is comprised of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council is comprised of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The Borough form of government used by Palisades Park is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.As of 2020, the Mayor of Palisades Park is Democrat Christopher J. Chung, whose term of office ends December 31, 2022. Chung is the first Korean-American mayor in Bergen County and the second in the State of New Jersey. Members of the Palisades Park Borough Council are Council President Frank Donahue (D, 2020), Chong Paul Kim (D, 2021), Jong Chul Lee (D, 2021), Son K. "Andy" Min (D, 2022), Cyndy A. Pirrera (D, 2020) and Michael P. Vietri (D, 2022).In January 2019, Andy Min was unanimously appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that became vacant when Christopher Chung took office as mayor.In August 2019, Michael Vietri was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that was vacated by Henry Ruh after he resigned the previous month as he was moving out of the borough.During the 2018 primary election for mayor, former Mayor James Rotundo's mother Lorraine Rotundo went on a "racist tirade" on Facebook two days after the primary election. At this point in time, the race was extremely close with Christopher Chung winning by a narrow margin. Lorraine Rotundo made the post in response to the massive number of Koreans at the voting booths. She stated that Palisades Park should “go to hell,” and exclaimed that the Korean residents could “have this F'n town.” She later went on to post that only English should be spoken in the Borough Hall. Former Mayor James Rotundo apologized on behalf of his mother and strongly denounced her comments. “I’m disgusted with her statement,” he said. Rotundo claimed that he was not raised by these sentiments.Christopher Chung was sworn into office as a council member in January 2014, having been selected by the council from among three names submitted by the Democratic Municipal Committee to fill the vacant seat of Jason Kim, who had resigned earlier that month.
