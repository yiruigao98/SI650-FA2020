Pemba is a port city in Mozambique. It is the capital of the province of Cabo Delgado and lies on a peninsula in Pemba Bay.
The town was founded by the Niassa Company in 1904 as Porto Amélia, after the Queen of Portugal, at the peninsula's southwestern tip and has grown around a port.  The city is renowned for its Portuguese colonial architecture. It was renamed Pemba at the end of Portuguese rule, in 1975. The city's inhabitants are primarily Swahili, Makondes, Macuas and Mwanis.  Local languages that are spoken are Kimwani and Macua, although Portuguese is widespread.
Pemba is also renowned as being a prime destination for water sport and diving enthusiasts as a coral reef lies close to the shore. It has increasingly become a tourist destination, particularly for upper-middle-class Mozambicans and South Africans. There are now 5 flights a week from Johannesburg to Pemba, several hotels (e.g. the Pemba Beach Hotel), restaurants, and other forms of entertainment. In the centre of Pemba, there is an authentic local market or souk, where arts and crafts, as well as traditional silverware can be bought. Pemba is the closest major city and airport for those who wish to visit the Quirimbas Islands and Quirimbas National Park.
