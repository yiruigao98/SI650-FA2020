== History ==
According to the Babad Ponorogo history, Ponorogo was founded when Bathoro Katong conquered the Wengker region. This region had previously been controlled by Suryo Ngalam Wengker. Bathoro Katong originally settled in modern-day Pekalongan in what is now the village Setono in district Jenangan. Though faced with many obstacles, Raden Katong, Aji Selo, and Ki Ageng Mirah and his family continued to establish settlements in the region.
With the consent of all parties, Bathoro Katong established the Duchy Ponorogo on 11 August 1496. This date is celebrated as the founding of Ponorogo, and is corroborated by ancient objects, such as a pair of stone gilang located in front of the fifth gate of the Katong Batara tomb complex. The gilang contains the forms of a human meditating, trees, eagle and elephants (candrasengkala gilang memet); all of which combine to represent the Saka year 1496.
