Polangui, officially the Municipality of Polangui (Central Bicolano: Banwaan kan Polangui; Tagalog: Bayan ng Polangui),  is a 1st class municipality in the province of Albay, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 88,221 people.


== Etymology ==
The origin of the name Polangui has many versions. The foremost and seemingly more accepted version is, "that of a giant robust tree which existed majestically in the early municipal settlement". The natives of the settlement called the "Oyangue", which also served as the early landmark of the area whereby new settlers looked upon in their wandering. Similarly, the early Spanish frontier settlers found this tree and it became their famous settlement landmark. The settlement was then called "Binanuaan" but often referred to as "Oyangue" by nearby settlers. As more settlers came to dwell and engage in trade endeavors with the indigenous inhabitants, the more was the settlement known in distant areas by the name "Oyangue" (referring to the tree landmark) which was more widely accepted than "Binanuaan". The passing of generations corrupted the word "Oyangue" into several acronyms. Most acceptable and widely used before was "Polangue" and later "Polangui" which has remained today.
Another legend is about the story of a maiden named "Pulang Angui" which means "Red Maria" (Angui is the nickname for Maria) who loved red colors for dress and whose beautiful body, face and red lips became the object of affection by the males to the point of adoration. She was modest in her ways, talented for possessing various skills, with happy disposition, showing love of arts and religion. She would lead the tribe in festivities. When the Spaniards came, the soldiers who first set foot in Polangui asked for the name of the place. The native thought the foreigners was asking for the name of "Pulang Angui" and said so. The Spaniards recorded the name of the place as Pulangui, a concoction of the name which was later on, as years went by, was converted to Polangui.


== History ==


=== Precolonial period ===
Pre-colonial Polangui was a fertile valley cradled by the virgin forests of Mount Masaraga. It was formed out of five settlements ruled by the Datu of Ponso till the late 1583. The center of the settlements was called Banwang gurang, meaning "old town" and is now known as Magurang.
In 1584, Fray Baltazar de la Magdalena, left Ambos Camarines and stumbled upon this place west of Mount Masaraga. He found that each of the five settlements had about 100 inhabitants. In the same year, he founded a settlement within the fertile valley and established a ranch, which he called "Binanuaan". Being inland and strategically situated, the town was spared from the frequent raids of sea pirates as well as from the occasional destruction caused by the eruption of Mayon Volcano.
Polangui became a visita, or outreach village under the jurisdiction of the Villa Santiago de Libon, which was established in 1573 by Juan de Salcedo, the grandson of the Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. The villa, which lies south-west of Polangui, would be known as the fourth of its kind in the entire archipelago.
Fray de la Magdalena was credited with the founding of Polangui. Old manuscripts in the Archives of Manila and in the Franciscan Convent in Manila point to 1584 as the year Polangui was founded, and thus considered as one of the oldest municipalities in the Philippines.


=== Spanish regime ===
By 1654, the original settlement became considerably bigger when Fray Alonzo de San Juan, was assigned in Polangui as "Encargado". The settlement was expanded reaching the present barangay sites in Lanigay, Ponso and Balinad. The town proper was established in Lanigay where a church made of wood was erected adjacent to about 280 wooden dwellings and more than 1,000 nipa huts. Unfortunately, this church together with the dwelling units was razed by a fire to the ground.
With the coming of another missionary, Fray Juan Bautista Marza, a new church made of bricks and stones was completed in 1664. This church stood on a new elevated site and still stands to this day. Under the leadership of Fray Marza, roads and bridges were also initiated and schools were introduced simultaneously with the Christian Doctrine and Spanish culture.
Growth of the settlement was so fast that it became a Poblacion and finally recognized as a Pueblo in 1674. Owing to its steady growth, a link with nearby Libon and Oas became a necessity. Hence, Fr. Jose Arnao, parish priest and Encargado from 1832 until 1852, directed the construction of roads and bridges that would connect Polangui to neighboring towns, including upland Buhi in Camarines Sur.
During Spanish regime, a significant highlight is the construction of its parish church which took 10 years to be completed starting in 1654 by Fray Alonzo de San Juan and completed in 1664 by Fray Juan Bautista Marza.
Polangueño martyr, Camilo Jacob, who is a photographer, was executed on January 4, 1897 with other Bicolanos. They are now commemorated as the Quince Martires del Bicolandia. A year later, the Spanish rule in Bicol ended with the mutiny of Guardia Civil in Naga led by Elias Angeles.


=== American period ===
Sometime during the Philippine-American War, Polangui became the seat of the Provincial Government of Albay for a brief period under Governor Domingo Samson. When the Americans conquered Polangui in 1890 without firing a single shot, the form of government went through transition from military to civil government then Commonwealth system. The seat of the municipal government was in Ponso with Clemente Sarte as the acting Chief Executive. A few months later, the seat of the municipal government was transferred to Centro Occidental and still remains up to this day.


=== Japanese occupation ===
When the Japanese forces occupied Polangui on December 13, 1941, Cipriano Saunar, then vice mayor of the Commonwealth government was appointed mayor by the Japanese military administration. A secret civil government was established simultaneously headed by Julian Saunar which was supported by the people. Cipriano Saunar's successor was Manuel Samson Sr. and in turn was succeeded by Jesus Salalima who ruled from 1947 to 1960.

Many of the images and sculpture are of great antiquity and of magnificent artistry. Some of them are even centuries-old, like the image of St. Peter which dates back to 1857 as an heirloom piece.
Karangahan sa Polangui — is Polangui's adaptation of the month-long celebration of the province's Karangahan sa Pasko: Albay Green Christmas, usually starting during the last week of November throughout December.

The festival is aimed at the safety of both families and environment by means of an environment-friendly celebration which can be achieved through continued propagation and adherence to its original campaign which is the "plastic-free, smoke-free and zero casualty" advocacy and objectives of the province. Before it was even called Karangahan sa Polangui, Polangueños are already celebrating it as Tia Angui Festival, a concoction of the name of the town's maiden, Angui (Tiya Angui), from which the town derived its name. Likewise, it may be interpreted as tiangge, a local term for "bazaar", which flood the town's public market during Christmas season. Usually, it is a tight gridwork of crowded stalls peddling Christmas decorations, fireworks, fresh fruits, assorted toys, discounted clothes, jewelry, accessories, electronics, and handicrafts, in the hallways and other empty spaces.
