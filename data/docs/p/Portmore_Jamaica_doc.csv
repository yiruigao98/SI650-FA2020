Portmore is a large coastal town in southern Jamaica in Saint Catherine, and a dormitory town for the neighbouring city of Kingston and Spanish Town.


== Geography ==
Portmore, also known as the "Sunshine City", is situated on the south coast in the Parish of St. Catherine. It is approximately 15 miles south-west of the capital of Kingston. It is divided into two regions, the plains to the north and the limestone hills of Hellshire to the south. Portmore has mangrove and saline wetlands to the south east and the alluvium areas in the center and west. The Port Henderson Hill and Hellshire Hill are elevated areas that rise above the gently sloping "Portmore Plains".The most densely populated areas are located on low-lying reclaimed lands.  Portmore consists of communities such as Old Portmore, Greater Portmore, Braeton and Hellshire. Portmore is one of the largest urban areas in St. Catherine with respect to human settlement, having a population 156,468(2001 census) and an annual growth rate of 4% since 1991.Portmore is built on a generally flat plain facing the Kingston Harbour with an intricate canal system which prevents flooding. Much of the land is reclaimed swamp. Port Henderson Hill, formerly known as Salt Pond Hill, is visible from neighbouring parishes and was a possible Arawak grave site because the Arawak buried their dead in caverns, which Port Henderson Hill is riddled with. The most famous cave is named "Twin Sisters".


== History ==
Portmore began as a large area for schematic residential development in the late 1960s, as the West Indies Home Contractors (WIHCON) organization built thousands of prototype housing units in an effort to alleviate the over-population of Kingston; the first was called Independence City. It has since grown into a suburban city to Kingston; its large population travels into Kingston daily for work, schooling, and many other essential services via the Portmore toll road.
Portmore was granted Municipality status in 2003 and has its own city council and mayor, following the British-based model of Jamaican local government. It now houses approximately 10% of the population of the Kingston Corporate Area.
Currently the mayor of Portmore is His Worship the Mayor Leon Thomas.
Portmore has affiliations with music artists Vybz Kartel, Mad Cobra, I-Wayne, Masicka,Gyptian, Spice and many soundsystems such as "Flavor Unit" and "Areacode 876".
