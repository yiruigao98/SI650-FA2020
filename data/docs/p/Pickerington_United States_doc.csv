Pickerington is a city in Fairfield and Franklin counties in the central region of the U.S. state of Ohio. It was founded in 1815 as Jacksonville, named after Andrew Jackson.  Pickerington was known as Jacksonville until 1827, when the citizens petitioned the state legislature to change the name to Pickerington in honor of its founder, Abraham Pickering. It is a suburb of Columbus. The population was 18,291 at the 2010 census. As land annexation, development, and immigration into the Columbus area continues, the city of Pickerington (like many area suburbs) has generally followed suit. Pickerington is also home to the Motorcycle Hall of Fame, located at 13515 Yarmouth Dr. off Interstate 70.
The Ohio Secretary of State certified Pickerington as a city in 1991 and it was designated as the "Violet Capital of Ohio" in 1996 by the Ohio Legislature. At 11.1 sq mi (29 km2), Pickerington is the second-largest city in Fairfield County behind Lancaster. Pickerington is located just east of Columbus. The city features a historic downtown shopping area, while Violet Township is home to rolling hills, log houses, forests, and fields.
