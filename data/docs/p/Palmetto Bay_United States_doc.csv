== History ==

In August 1992, Palmetto Bay and the surrounding South Miami-Dade area were severely damaged by Hurricane Andrew. Many of the homes and businesses in Palmetto Bay were destroyed. In the subsequent years, the area was slowly rebuilt. Unlike the destroyed homes which were made of wood frame construction, the new homes and construction were rebuilt with concrete walls. Although many areas of Miami were heavily affected by Hurricane Andrew, Palmetto Bay was one of the worst affected and remains a reminder of the hurricane's extensive disaster in the city today.The village incorporated on September 10, 2002, taking the territory formerly held by the Cutler and East Perrine census-designated places. The founding council consisted of Mayor Eugene Flinn, Jr., Vice Mayor, Linda Robinson, and council members, John Breder, Edward Feller, and Paul Neidhart.
