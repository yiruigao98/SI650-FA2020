== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name Malang is uncertain. One of the theory said that the name Malang is derived from the words Malangkuçeçwara which means "God has destroyed the false and enforced the right". The words was taken from an ancient term which mention a legendary temple called Malangkuçeçwara supposedly located near the city Malang. The word Malangkuçeçwara was applied as the motto of the city of Malang. The name "Malang" first appeared on the Pamotoh / Ukirnegara Inscription (1120 Saka / 1198 AD) which was discovered on 11 January 1975 by a Bantaran plantation administrator in Wlingi, Blitar Regency. In the copper inscription, one part is written (with the following translation) as follows.
Malang here refers to an eastern of Mount Kawi. Although it is known that the use of Malang has at least been going on since the 12th century, it cannot be ascertained the etymology of its territory.
The first hypothesis refers to the name of a holy building called Malangkuçeçwara (pronounced [malaŋkuʃeʃworo]). The sacred building is referred to in two Balitung King inscriptions from Ancient Mataram, namely the Mantyasih Inscription in 907 AD and the Inscription of 908 AD. Experts still have not obtained an agreement where the building is located. On the one hand, there are a number of experts who say that the Malangkuçeçwara building is located in the Mount Buring area, a mountain that stretches east of Malang where there is one of its peaks named "Malang". Others on the other hand suspect that the actual location of the sacred building is in the Tumpang area, Malang Regency. In the area, there is a village called Malangsuka, which according to historians comes from the word Malangkuça (pronounced [malankuʃoː]) which is pronounced upside down. This opinion is reinforced by the existence of ancient relics around Tumpang such as Jago Temple and Kidal Temple which is the territory of the Kingdom of Singhasari.The Malangkuçeçwara name consists of 3 words, namely mala which means falsehood, cheating, falsehood, and evil, angkuça (pronounced [aŋkuʃo] which means to destroy or destroy, and içwara (pronounced [iʃworo]) which means God. Therefore, Malangkuçeçwara means "God has destroyed the vanity".The second hypothesis refers to the story of the assault of the Mataram Sultanate forces to Malang in 1614 led by Tumenggung Alap-Alap. According to folklore, there was a conversation between Tumenggung Alap-Alap and one of his assistants regarding the condition of Malang before the attack began. The assistant from Tumenggung Alap-Alap mentioned residents and soldiers from the area as residents who "blocked the halangi" ("Malang" in Javanese) from the arrival of Mataram troops. After the conquest, the Mataram forces named the area of conquest as Malang.


== History ==


=== Early history ===

The Malang area in the Pleistocene era was still a deep basin flanked by volcanic activity from mountains such as the Karst Mountains in the South, Kawi, Butak, and Kelud in the West, Anjasmoro, and Arjuno-Welirang complex in the Northeast and North, and the Tengger Mountains Complex in East. The basin has not been inhabited by humans because the condition is still in the form of lava and hot lava flows from the surrounding mountains. Towards the rainy season, the Malang basin is filled with water flowing through the mountain slopes leading to a number of rivers and forming an ancient swamp. The swamps spread to create ancient lakes.
When the ancient lake had not dried up, early human civilization was still in the early to advanced stages of Hunting and Collecting Food. The settlements are still on the slopes of mountains and mountains that surround Malang in the form of natural caves. Therefore, it is understandable that the discovery of artifacts in the paleolithic and mesolithic period is found in mountainous areas, such as on the slopes of Mount Kawi, Arjuno-Welirang, Tengger, Semeru and the Southern Karst Mountains.Malang ancient lake gradually dried up in the Holocene era and caused the Malang region to become a plateau in Malang. When it began to enter the Planting Period, early humans began to descend mountains and make a number of settlements and agricultural areas. The discovery of a number of artifacts in the form of two square pickaxes, chalcedony stone tools and hand-held andesite axes on the east side of Mount Kawi in the Kacuk area around the Metro and Brantas streams reinforced this assumption. [8] In addition, the study estimates that the forms of occupancy in the transitional period were in the form of a stilt house, where the body of the house was supported by the legs of the house and was several meters above the ground. This is reinforced by the discovery of artifacts in the form of "Watu Gong" or "Watu Kenong" in Dinoyo, Lowokwaru, Malang, whose forms are similar to traditional musical instruments, namely gong, which are actually swear or foundation of a stilt house. The growth of settlements around the river flowing in Malang became the forerunner of the ancient civilizations of the Homo sapiens.


=== Hindu and Islamic Kingdoms ===


==== Kanjuruhan Kingdom ====
The history of Malang Regency could be revealed through the Dinoyo inscription at year of 760 as the primary official document to support the birth of Malang before a new inscription was discovered in 1986, which is yet to be deciphered. According to the inscription, it was concluded that the 8th century was the beginning of the existence of Malang Regency's government due to the birth of King Gajayana's ruling of his Indianized Hindu kingdom in Malang. From the Dinoyo inscriptions, it is noted that the inscription used the "Candra Sengkala" or Cronogram Calendar, and stated that the birth date of Malang Regency was on Jum'at Legi (sweet Friday) of 28 November 760.


==== Medang Kingdom ====
Kanjuruhan Kingdom power is estimated to not last long. The kingdom was finally under the rule of Medang i Bhumi Mataram (Ancient Mataram Kingdom or Medang) during the leadership of King Dyah Balitung (899–911 AD). In the Balingawan Inscription (813 Saka / 891 AD), it is mentioned Pu Huntu as Rakryan Kanuruhan (ruler of Kanuruhan character) in the reign of King Mpu Daksa (911–919 AD). The area that used to be an autonomous kingdom has dropped one level to a watak (region) that is on a level with the duchy or district (one level under the authority of the king). Watak Kanuruhan which covers the center of Malang today is an entity that stands side by side with Watak Hujung (in Ngujung, Toyomarto Village, District Singosari, Malang Regency) and Watak Tugaran (in Tegaron, Lesanpuro, Kedungkandang, Malang Regency) which each oversees several wanua (village level).When the capital Medang was moved to the Tamwlang and Watugaluh (Jombang) areas during the reign of King Mpu Sindok (929–948 AD), several inscriptions such as Sangguran, Turyyan, Gulung-Gulung, Linggasutan, Jeru-Jeru, Tija, Kanuruhan, Muncang, and Wurandungan describes a number of tax liability policies for sima (civil villages) in Malang and a number of land grant processes to build temples.


==== Kahuripan, Janggala, and Kediri Kingdom ====

There is no record that explains in detail the status and role of the area around Malang during King Airlangga's leadership in addition to the fact that Malang entered the territory of the Kingdom of Kahuripan. Because the Malang area is no longer the center of government of the Kingdom which is centered around Mount Penanggungan and Sidoarjo with its capital Kahuripan. Even when Raja Airlangga divided Kahuripan into Panjalu which was centered in Daha (Kadiri) and Jenggala which remained centered in Kahuripan, the Malang region was included as a peripheral of the powers of both kingdoms. However, it can be ascertained that the Malang region entered the Jenggala region at the time of this division. The division of Kahuripan shows that Mount Kawi was used as the boundary of the two new kingdoms with the eastern side obtained by Jenggala.
Malang again became an important area in the history of Panjalu or Jenggala when King Jayabhaya of Panjalu conquered Jenggala. In the Hantang Inscription (1057 Saka / 1135 AD), it is written Panjalu Jayati ("Panjalu Menang"), signifying Panjalu's victory over Jenggala. The inscription also included the granting of special privileges to several villages in Hantang (Ngantang, Malang Regency) and its surroundings for their services in favor of Panjalu during the war. This inscription also shows that the Malang region is under the authority of Panjalu.
The Kamulan Inscription (1116 Saka / 1194 AD) records the events of the attack of an area from the east of Daha (Kadiri) against King Kertajaya (in the Pararaton called Dandang Gendhis) who resided in the Katang-Katang Kedaton. There is no further research on whether the attack was a rebellion or attempted conquest. However, the existence of the Kamulan Inscription shows that there was a new political force that emerged to oppose Panjalu's power. This argument is reinforced by the existence of the Sukun Inscription (1083 Saka / 1161 AD) which mentions a king named Jayamerta who gave special rights to Sukun Village (allegedly in Sukun Sub-District, District Sukun, Malang) for fighting enemies. Jayamerta has never been stated explicitly or implicitly in various records that refer to information regarding both the list of rulers of Kadiri and Jenggala. Some historians such as Agus Sunyoto mention that the area of origin of the resistance was named Purwa or Purwwa. This was supported by Sunyoto's argument when referring to all Majapahit rulers as descendants of Ken Arok who "[...] drained his seed into the world through teja which emanated from" secrets "Ken Dedes, naraiswari [...] Purwa Kingdom." "Naraiswari (or nareswari / Ardanareswari) himself in Sanskrit means "the main woman" and Ken Dedes himself is the daughter of Mpu Purwa, a brahmana from Panawijyan (Kelurahan Polowijen, Kecamatan Blimbing, Malang). In the end the resistance effort from the area which was said to be named Purwa / Purwwa was successfully crushed by Panjalu.
Some historians attribute the series of events of resistance and crackdown to the socio-political context of the two conflicts involving King Kertajaya and the Brahmin class. The first is the policy of King Kertajaya who tried to reduce a number of rights from the Brahmana class. Some folklore shows that King Kertajaya wanted to be "worshiped" by the Brahmins so that it was contrary to the religious teachings of the Brahmins. The second is the kidnapping of Ken Dedes by Tunggul Ametung, akuwu (equivalent to sub-district head) for the Tumapel region. According to Blasius Suprapto, the location of Tumapel itself was in an area formerly called Kutobedah (now called Kotalama, Kedungkandang, Malang). The implication of the two conflicts was the withdrawal of political support from the Brahmana class against Raja Kertajaya.


==== Singhasari Empire ====

The collapse of Panjalu / Kadiri and the birth of the Tumapel Kingdom in Malang originated from the Brahmana class from Panjalu who tried to save himself from political persecution by King Kertajaya. They fled eastward and joined the political forces in Tumapel, led by Ken Angrok or Ken Arok. He then rebelled against Akuwu Tunggul Ametung and took control of Tumapel. Ken Arok's victory was at the same time a statement of war to separate himself from Panjalu/Kadiri. The power struggle between Kertajaya and Ken Arok towards the Malang region and its surroundings led to the Battle of Ganter in Ngantang (now a sub-district in Malang Regency) (1144 Saka / 1222 AD) which was won by Ken Arok. He also ordained himself as the first king of the Kingdom of Tumapel with the title Rajasa Sang Amurwabhumi. The capital itself remained in Tumapel but changed its name to Kutaraja.

During the period of the transfer of the royal capital during the reign of King Wisnuwardhana from Kutaraja to Singhasari (Singosari District, Malang Regency) in 1176 Saka / 1254 AD, there was no comprehensive record of the strategic status of the Malang region in the Tumapel era. There was no explanation for the reasons for the move but starting in this era Singhasari became the name of this kingdom. The remaining data only shows a number of historical places in Malang such as the Gunung Katu area in Genengan (Prangargo, Wagir, Malang Regency) which according to historian Dwi Cahyono is a dharma site, Kidjo Rejo area (Kidal Village, District Tumpang, Malang Regency), where Raja Anusapati was worshiped in Candi Kidal, and the Tumpang area where Raja Wisnuwardhana was dharma in Jago Temple. Another legacy is the spring of Watugede in Watugede Village, Singosari District, Malang Regency. According to Agus Irianto, the bathing staff of Watugede, Pararaton wrote that this place was often used by Ken Dedes and other prospective women to clean the body. The village elders also believe that in this place Ken Arok also saw the light emanating from the body of Ken Dedes as a sign that he was a nareswari.During the leadership of Raja Kertanegara, the Kingdom of Singhasari faced a rebellion by Jayakatwang from the bracelet area (around Madiun). Jayakatwang himself is the great-grandson of Raja Kertajaya according to Negarakertagama and nephew of Raja Wisnuwardhana (from the lineage of women) according to the Mula Malurung Inscription. The rebellion killed Raja Kertanegara, the last king of Singhasari, due to his territory having no defense when most of his military was sent for the Pamalayu Expedition. Jayakatwang easily occupied the capital, took power and moved the center of government to his ancestral land, Kadiri.


==== Majapahit Empire ====

Malang was not the center of the power struggle between Jayakatwang, Raden Wijaya, and Kublai Khan's army from Mongol. After winning the succession of power, Raden Wijaya, who held the title of Kertarajasa Jayawardhana moved the center of power to the area he had built in the Tarik Forest (now around Mojokerto and District Tarik, Sidoarjo). However, the Malang region witnessed history from the fate of Jayakatwang who was exiled to another spring in Polaman (now Kalirejo Village, Lawang District, Malang Regency). According to Pararaton and Kidung Harsyawijaya, this was where Jayakatwang was inspired to write Wukir Polaman, his last literary work before being executed by Raden Wijaya.In the Majapahit government structure according to the Waringin Pitu Inscription (AD 1447), the Malang region is included in the Bhumi or the capital of empire. He is a nagara (provincial equivalent) named Tumapel which is led by a rajya (governor) or natha (master) or bhre (nobleman / prince) —such as dukes.Negarakertagama also recorded King Hayam Wuruk's visit to several places in the Malang region in 1359 AD. According to Yudi Anugrah Nugroho, the tour was part of a series of trips by King Hayam Wuruk to review the development around Lumajang. This visit is usually done when the harvest period is over. There are at least two contexts of the tour, namely recreation and pilgrimage. For the recreational context, the first place was Kasuranggan Park in the Sumberawan area (Toyomarto Village, District Singosari, Malang Regency). It was here that King Hayam Wuruk built a stupa as a place of worship for Buddhists so that it became the Sumberawan Temple as it is now. The second is Kedung Biru. Some historians connect Kedung Biru with the location now called Dusun Biru, Gunungrejo Village, District Singosari, Malang Regency. It is called kedung (meaning: ravine) because it is on the edge of a cliff near the Klampok River. In addition to the recreational place of Raja Hayam Wuruk, it is said that this place is a sanctuary for kris made by Mpu Gandring and other royal weapons. The third is the Bureng area identified as the Wendit natural bath in Mangliawan Village, District Pakis, Malang Regency.
For the context of pilgrimage, King Hayam Wuruk visited several heritage temples of the Singhasari Kingdom which aimed to dharma the ancestors (Wangsa Rajasa). Some of the temples visited include Kidal Temple (in honor of King Anusapati), Jago Temple (in honor of King Wisnuwardhana), and Candi Singasari (in honor of Raja Kertanegara). Especially for Singasari Temple, there is debate about whether it was built during the reign of Singhasari or Majapahit Kingdom. Because, according to the National Library of the Republic of Indonesia, Singosari Temple was built around 1300 AD (the reign of King Raden Wijaya) as a temple of respect, if not dharma, Raja Kertanegara along with Jawi Temple. However, there is an argument which states that this temple was being built during the reign of King Kertanegara itself as a public worship temple. The consequence of this last argument is that the construction of the temple was not completed due to the occupation of Singhasari by Jayakatwang.The Malang region (Tumapel) became one of the objects of political conflict when the War of Paregreg erupted (1404–1406). This area is claimed by Aji Rajanata, Bhre Wirabhumi II (Blambangan, Banyuwangi). However, the claim was opposed by Manggalawardhana, Bhre Tumapel II, who was still the son of King Hayam Wuruk. Therefore, this area is considered as the frontline of the battle involving Majapahit (West) and Blambangan ('East Majapahit). However, because War Paregreg was won by King Wikramawardhana, Tumapel returned to Majapahit power.When the Majapahit Kingdom arrived Admiral Cheng Ho from China (Ming Dynasty) in 1421 AD, he agreed with King Wikramawardhana (1389–1429 AD) to place Ma Hong Fu and Ma Yung Long as ambassadors of the Ming Dynasty at Tumapel. This can be attributed to Admiral Cheng Ho's diplomatic efforts to ensure the security of ethnic Chinese in the Majapahit region. During the War of Paregreg (1406), around 170 delegates from the Ming Dynasty were sent by Admiral Cheng Ho to re-establish diplomatic relations between China and Majapahit after the conflict of the Jayakatwang-Raden Wijaya-Kublai Khan in the era of transition from Singhasari to Majapahit. However, all the envoys were massacred by King Wikramawardhana who could not distinguish their arrival status as an enemy or not. The role of Admiral Cheng Ho was also significant for the Malang region (Tumapel) in 1432 when he was with his subordinates, Gan Eng Cu and (Duke (Bhre) of Arya Teja I of Tuban) and his younger brother, Gan Eng Wan, helped Ratu Maharani Sri Suhita (1429–1447 AD ) to unite Daha (Kadiri) and Tumapel after internal conflict. For his services, Bro Eng Wan was given the title Raden Arya Suganda was appointed as an official at Tumapel.


==== Sengguruh Kingdom ====

Sengguruh is the last Hindu kingdom and the rest of the heritage of Majapahit sympathizers in Malang. He was an independent kingdom after the fall of Majapahit. Hermanus Johannes de Graff argued that the son of the Brawijaya VII, Raden Pramana fled to the remote mountain region in the south due to the occupation of Daha (Kadiri) (capital of Majapahit since Girindrawardhana – Brawijaya VI) by Sultan Trenggana from Demak in 1527. The leader of this region is Arya Terung with the title Adipati Sengguruh. The name Sengguruh is said to be related to the existence of an education center and the residence of the knights or banner (commonly called Kepanjian or Kepanjen area). The banners who want to study in Kepanjen are said to be saying "Let's go to the Teacher" which refers to the place where they study. These words gradually became Sengguruh.According to Babad ing Gresik (Chronicles of Gresik), the kingdom had tried to attack the Lamongan and Giri (Gresik) areas in 1535. However, the efforts of Arya Terung were unsuccessful, if not failed to maintain their occupation of the two regions. In fact, according to the records in Tedhak Dermayudan, after the failure of the conquest, Arya Terung adopted Islam and spread Islamic teachings throughout Sengguruh. As a result, the Majapahit sympathizers led by Raden Pramana rebelled and made the Arya Terung flee north around the lower reaches of the Brantas River. With the help of Sultan Trenggana who had conquered the former capital of the Singhasari Empire in 1545. Sengguruh succeeded in quelling the rebellion. Raden Pramana fled towards Blambangan. In Serat Kanda, Sultan Trenggana once again appointed Arya Terung as Duke of Sengguruh which was under the Demak Sultanate. In addition, the Malang area after the conquest of Sultan Trenggana changed to Kutho Bedah ("The Destructed City"). Sengguruh Kingdom remains in the form of ruins in Sumedang Hamlet, Jenggala Village (on the west side of Sengguruh Village), District Kepanjen, Malang Regency.


=== Dutch East Indies ===

The city was capital city of Singhasari in 1222, then transferred to Dutch colony. Malang was modernized under the Dutch; its mild climate which results from its elevation, along with its proximity to the major port of Surabaya, made it a popular destination for the Dutch and other Europeans. Malang began to grow and develop rapidly and various economic sectors of the community were increasing, especially the need for space to carry out various activities. As a result, there was a change in land use which was marked by a built up area that appeared uncontrollably. Changes in land functions undergo rapid changes, such as from functioning land agriculture becomes a functioning land of housing and industry. In 1879, Malang was connected to Java's railroad network, further increasing development and leading to increased industrialization. On 1 April 1914, Malang was designated gemeente (city).


=== Japanese occupation ===
During the Japanese population in Nusantara, Malang was also occupied by Japan. Imperial Japanese Army began occupying Malang on 7 March 1942. During the Japanese occupation there was a shift in the function of the building. The houses where the Dutch lived were transferred to their functions. The Dutch building on Jalan Semeru which was used as an office or the headquarters of the Dutch troops was converted into a Kempetai building.


=== Independence of Indonesia ===
After Independence of Indonesia in 1945, Malang became part of the Republic of Indonesia on 21 September 1945 and re-entered on 2 March 1947 after being re-occupied by the Dutch East Indies. The government was changed to Malang City Government on 1 January 2001 based on second amendments of Indonesia's Constitution.Along with growth came urbanization. The government could not satisfy the population's needs for affordable housing, which led to the building of shanty towns along the rivers and rail tracks. Today, the shanty towns still exist; although some have been transformed into "better" housing.

== Transport ==


=== Road ===
There are 2,960 roads in Malang with a total length of 1,027 kilometres (638 mi). This count does not include provincial and state roads. In addition to being located at Indonesian National Route 23, which connects it to Gempol and Kepanjen, Malang is also connected to provincial roads linking regencies and cities in East Java. To increase connectivity in East Java, toll roads are being built, one of them is the Pandaan-Malang Toll Road. This toll road will end in Madyopuro, Kedungkandang. Now the toll has entered the construction phase.
On 28 May 2006, a blow-out occurred during drilling for an exploration of natural gas in Porong, Sidoarjo Regency. The blow-out initially produced 5000 m³ of mud flow per day. 18 months after the incident, the mudflow is estimated to be 80,000 m³ to 100,000 m³ per day. This ongoing mudflow has forced the closure of the Porong-Gempol toll road in East Java, which effectively cut off the transport line from Surabaya to Malang.
