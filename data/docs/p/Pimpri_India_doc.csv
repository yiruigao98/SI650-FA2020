Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune (IAST: Piṃprī Ciñcvaḍ) is the advanced extended city limits of Pune and part of the Pune Metropolitan Region. However, it was separated from PMC with its own taluka and municipal corporation. The modern area developed from what were rural suburbs of Pune as a result of rapid industrialization that began within a decade after Indian independence in 1947. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, Pune was once popularly famous for being Asia's richest municipal corporation. It is situated at an altitude of 530 m (1,740 ft) above sea level, about 15 km (9.3 mi) northwest of the historic center of Pune. Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune, as well as the cantonment areas of Camp, Khadki and Dehu Road together form the urban core of the Pune Metropolitan Region. According to the 2011 census, It has a population of 1.72 million residing in an area of 181 km2 (70 sq mi). It is home to a vast variety of industrial establishments and is well known for its automotive and manufacturing industry which call up Pune as the automobile manufacturing hub of India.


== Medieval Ages ==

Chinchwad is noted for the shrine of Morya Gosavi, a prominent saint of the Ganapatya denomination of Hinduism that worships Lord Ganesha as the Supreme Being or its metaphysical concept of Brahman. Various sources place Moraya Gosavi between the 13th and 17th centuries CE. The inscription on the temple records that its construction began in 1658 CE.


== British Raj and Partition of India ==

Chinchwad is also the birthplace of the Chapekar brothers: Damodar Hari (1870-1898), Balkrishna Hari (1873-1899) and Vasudeo Hari, who assassinated W. C. Rand, a British civil service officer and the chairman of the Special Plague Committee of Poona (Pune), on 22 June 1897.Following the partition of India, the Government of India constructed 1,609 residences and laid out around 300 plots on 203 acres of land in the Pimpri area. This area came to be known as Pimpri Camp is one of the 31 refugee camps in Bombay State (present day Maharashtra) set up during the period.


== Industrialization ==
Starting in the mid-1950s, the green village fields on the sides of the highway and railways linking Pune to Mumbai were subject to large industrial development. In the 1960s, the newly founded Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) purchased vast tracts of land, developing roads and water supply infrastructure. It developed the area for a cluster of pharmaceutical, mechanical, and automotive industries, and, more recently, information technology, of national and international importance. Hundreds of thousands of people have migrated to the new hub to fill the jobs and benefit from rapid economic development.
On 4 March 1970, the villages of Pimpri, Chinchwad, Bhosari and Akurdi merged into a single municipal authority, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Council. Two years later, the Pimpri Chinchwad New Town Development Authority (PCNTDA) was established. Its chief objective was to create a planned environment for the working population in the vicinity of their work place. On 11 October 1982, the Municipal Council was merged with seven surrounding villages and the PCNTDA area to form the a new Municipal Corporation (PCMC), and it split apart from the Haveli taluka to become the 15th and newest of Pune district's talukas. The size the city more than doubled in 1997 (from 84.51 km2 to 170.51 km2.) with the addition (in part or in full) of 18 villages located at the periphery of the PCMC as it existed in 1982. Tathawade was added to the city in 2008, bringing the total area of the city to 176.41 km2.


== Geography ==
The area within the city limits is widely considered as 'flat' given the altitude varying between 530 and 570 m above sea level. The city is situated approximately at 18° 37' North latitude and 73° 48' East longitude bordering its twin city of Pune on the north and north-west. The centers of the twin cities are 15 km apart. Three rivers Pavana, Mula and Indrayani flow through this area. The base rock found throughout the city is Deccan trap basalt. Building stone is the only commercially important mineral found in the area.


=== Climate ===

The city experiences three seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Typical summer months are February to May with maximum temperatures above 35 °C and reaching up to 42 °C on hotter days. The city receives most of its 722 mm of rainfall in the monsoon months of June to September. The temperature in the winter months of October to January ranges from 12 °C (min) to 30 °C (max), with night temperatures often falling below 10 °C.


== Economy ==
Pune is one of the major industrial hubs in Asia and many of these industries are situated in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Industrialization started in 1954 with the arrival of Hindustan Antibiotics Limited.

== Government and public services ==


=== Civic administration ===
The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is the local civic body. It comprises two branches: the executive branch headed by the Municipal Commissioner, an IAS officer appointed by the Government of Maharashtra, and an elected deliberative branch, the general body, headed by the Mayor. Municipal elections are held every five years to elect councilors, popularly known as 'corporators', who form the general body of the PCMC. The corporators, in turn, elect the mayor and the deputy mayor. In the Municipal Elections held in February 2017, 128 corporators were elected to represent the 32 electoral wards (4 corporators per ward). While the position of the mayor is mostly ceremonial, the chief executive of the city is the Municipal Commissioner, appointed by the state government. The JNNURM award for Best Performing City, under Sub-Mission for Urban Infrastructure and Governance, was given to Pimpri-Chinchwad. The "System of Assisting Residents and Tourist Through Helpline Information" (SARATHI), the grievance portal of the city, has gained national recognition and is a role model for other cities.The Pimpri Chinchwad Police in Pune is the law enforcement agency for the area of Pimpri Chinchwad in Pune. It was carved out of Pune Police department and took charge on 15 August 2018. It is a division of the Maharashtra Police and is headed by the Police Commissioner, an officer of the Indian Police Service.
The Pimpri Chinchwad New Town Development Authority (PCNTDA), popularly known as Prādhikaraṇ (Marathi: प्राधिकरण),  is the urban planning authority of the city. The authority was established in 1970 to tackle the problems and meet the infrastructure needs of rapid industrialization as well as to plan housing for the working population in the vicinity of their work place. Ever since its formation, the PMRDA has been keen to take over PCNTDA, however, there has been opposition from local leaders who want it to merge with the PCMC.Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), which was on the cards since 1997, was formed on 31 March 2015 and is responsible for the integrated development of the PMR. Currently its jurisdiction extends over 7,256.46 km2 (2,802 sq mi) and includes the municipal corporations of Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune, three cantonment boards, seven municipal councils, 13 census towns and 842 villages.


=== Utility services ===
The Pavana dam located 35 km from Pimpri Chinchwad is the sole source of water for the city. The water is lifted at the Ravet bund is pumped to the Nigdi filtration plant from where it distributed to the entire city. As of 2018, PCMC provides around 450 million liters per day (MLD) of water to the city. This leads to the generation of around 290 MLD of sewage, of which the civic body has capacity to treat only 240 MLD at its 13 sewage treatment plants, a problem that has persisted for years. The untreated water is let into the rivers which lead to several health and environmental problems. Similar problems in the twin city of Pune as well as in the suburban areas, the rivers in the PMR are among the most polluted rivers in the state.The state owned Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited supplies electricity to the city. The power comes from thermal, hydro, gas and renewable sources such as solar, wind and sugarcane bagasse. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), owned by the central government, as well as private enterprises such as Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Idea Cellular, Aircel, Tata DoCoMo, Tata Teleservices, Virgin Mobile, and MTS India, are the leading telephone and cell phone service providers in the city.

==== Bus service ====

Until 2007, Pimpri-Chinchwad was served by its own public transport bus service provider, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT). On 19 October 2007, it was merged with the Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) that served the neighbouring city of Pune to form the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML; lit. Pune Metropolitan Transport Corporation Ltd.). PMPML runs buses on 371 routes that cover a radius of 20 km around the cities of Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune. It also runs services on BRT corridors under the brand name Rainbow BRTS. As of May 2018, there are two operating BRT corridors in Pimpri-Chinchwad with a combined length of 22.5 km, while work is underway on three other corridors with a total length 28 km. Although the BRTS project has been deemed a failure in the neighbouring Pune, PCMC claims that the two BRT corridors, Sangvi-Kiwale and Nashik Phata-Wakad, have seen a rise in ridership after they became operation in 2015. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation operates buses from its main station at Vallabh Nagar, Pimpri to all major cities and towns in Maharashtra as well as in the neighbouring states. Private companies also run bus services throughout India.


==== Metro ====

Pune Metro, a mass rapid transit system, is under construction and expected to be operational by 2021. The detailed project report (DPR) was prepared for the initial two lines by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation which was approved by the State government in 2012 and by the Central government in December 2016. Out of the two lines, Line 1 will run through PCMC limits from PCMC Building to Dapodi and further to Swargate in Pune City. A detailed project report is being prepared for the extension of the line up to Nigdi. The project is being implemented by MahaMetro, a 50:50 joint venture of the State and Central governments. Line 3 from Hinjewadi to Civil Court, Shivajinagar was approved by the State and Central governments in January and March 2018, respectively. The 23.3-km line is being implemented by PMRDA on a public-private partnership basis and will have a station at Wakad in PCMC limits. Another metro route connecting Hinjewadi to Moshi via Nashik Phata, Bhosari is also being contemplated.


=== Road transport ===

Pimpri Chinchwad has a 633-km long extensive network of roads connecting its various neighbourhoods.

At the rate of 663 vehicles per 1000 residents, a total of 1.57 million vehicles are registered in the city in 2018, of which 1.17 million are two-wheelers. Public transportation in the city has not been able to keep up with the demand and is infamous for its unreliability leading to a constant upward trend in the number of vehicles. Unsurprisingly, the whopping number of vehicles has led to several problems including air pollution, noise pollution and traffic congestion.
