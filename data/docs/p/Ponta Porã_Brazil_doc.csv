== History ==
The origin of Ponta Porã begins with the formation of a village called Punta Porã.
Before the Paraguayan War, the site of the city was a deserted region in the interior of Paraguay inhabited by tribes of Indians, such as Nhandevas and Caiuás, descendants of the Guarani people. The region was also a place where travelers stopped to rest while crossing from Brazil to Paraguay. In 1777 a military expedition arrived in the region, aiming to explore the region. In 1862 the military unit led by Lieutenant Antonio João Ribeiro established a base near the Dourados River (in what is now the municipality of Antônio João) and there founded the Military Colony of Dourados. In 1864, the time of the Paraguayan War, the Military Colony of Dourados was destroyed by the Paraguayans, and Lieutenant Ribeiro was killed.
In 1872, after the end of the Paraguayan War, the border between Brazil and Paraguay was definitely established, leaving the region of Ponta Porã in Brazilian territory. In 1880 arrived in the region Mr. Nazareth, a military commander who established his camp in what is now the city of Pedro Juan Caballero. In 1882, Tomás Laranjeiras started producing and selling yerba mate in Ponta Porã and exporting it to Argentina. In 1892, with the garrison of the Military Colony of Dourados protecting the region, Ponta Porã begun to make its initial  economic progress. Furthermore, many gaucho immigrants arrived, who came to work in agriculture and raise cattle. In 1897 the first police department in Ponta Porã was created and Mr. Nazareth was appointed its commander.
Ponta Porã became part of the District of Bela Vista, Mato Grosso do Sul in 1900. In 1913 the municipality of Ponta Porã was founded, the city no longer belonging  to the district of Bela Vista. The first Mayor appointed was Ponciano de Matos Pereira. In 1915 the Governor of the State of Mato Grosso, Caetano de Albuquerque raised the status of Ponta Porã's municipality to county and in 1916 the first Judge of Ponta Porã's County was appointed, Possidônio de Souza Guimarães. In 1919 was created in Ponta Porã the 11th Cavalry Regiment and the following year its first commander was installed,  Captain Hipólito Paes. In 1943, President Getúlio Vargas created the Federal Territory of Ponta Porã, with Ponta Porã as its capital city. In 1977 the state of Mato Grosso do Sul was created, of which Ponta Porã is currently part.
