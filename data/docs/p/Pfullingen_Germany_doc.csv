With the Peace of Westphalia Pfullingen returned to Württemberg. The monastery was vacated.In 1699 Pfullingen again received town privileges and was raised to a monastery office. In 1806 it was incorporated into the  Oberamt Reutlingen. In 1824 the town of Pfullingen had 3,435 inhabitants. The hydropower of the Echaz made very early industrialization possible.
