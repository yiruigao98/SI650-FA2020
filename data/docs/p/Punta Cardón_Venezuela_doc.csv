Punta Cardón is a town and parish in the Carirubana autonomous municipality of Falcón state, Venezuela.
The town was once a poor fishing community on the Gulf of Coro on the northwest coast of Venezuela.
Since the mid-1940s the community has become surrounded by the Paraguana- oil-refining complex, which today is run by PDVSA, the state oil company.
The Spanish architect José Lino Vaamonde built the Club Manaure in Punta Cardón (1953) for Shell Venezuela.
