== History ==
The former parish of Suur-Pirkkala (Great Pirkkala) is mentioned in historical writings from the 14th century. It occupied over half of Pirkanmaa, a region nowadays populated by about 360,000 inhabitants. Suur-Pirkkala began to split when new parishes and municipalities were founded. In 1922 the remains of Suur-Pirkkala were split into Pohjois- (Northern) and Etelä-Pirkkala (Southern Pirkkala). In 1938 the name of Northern Pirkkala was changed to Nokia and Southern Pirkkala reverted to its original name.
The present-day region of Pirkanmaa is named after Pirkkala.
