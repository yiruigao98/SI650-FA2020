== History ==
Dating back to 1155, is the first historical record confirming the existence of Płońsk. Around the castle a group of inhabitants was formed, most of whom initially worked on the land. In 1400,  Siemowit IV of Mazovia, granted it town rights under Chełmno law, then merchants and craftsmen started to come to town.
In the early twentieth century, the population of 10,000 was equally divided between Poles and Jews. The Jews lived mostly within the city, whilst the Poles were more scattered and tended to live in the countryside. Many of the Jewish residents of Płońsk immigrated to Palestine for Zionist reasons, spurred on by the idea of building a Jewish homeland. In September 1940, Jews from the town and the surrounding areas were imprisoned in a ghetto. Soon a typhus epidemic broke out. A hospital, a bathhouse for the sick, a pharmacy, and a folk kitchen were organized in the ghetto . In total, 12,000 Jews were prisoners of the ghetto and from October 1942, they were sent to Auschwitz extermination camp.
