Putrajaya (Malaysian pronunciation: [putraˈdʒaja, putrəˈdʒajə]), officially the Federal Territory of Putrajaya (Malay: Wilayah Persekutuan Putrajaya), is a planned city and the federal administrative centre of the Malaysian capital. The seat of the federal government was shifted in 1999 from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya because of overcrowding and congestion in the former. Kuala Lumpur remains as Malaysia's national capital per the constitution, and is still the seat of the King of Malaysia and the Parliament, as well as being the country's commercial and financial centre. 
The establishment of Putrajaya was the idea of the then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. It became Malaysia's third federal territory, after Kuala Lumpur in 1984 and Labuan in 2001.
Named after the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, the territory is entirely enclaved within the Sepang District of the state of Selangor. Putrajaya is also a part of MSC Malaysia, a special economic zone that covers Klang Valley. In Sanskrit, "putra" (पुत्र) means "prince" or "male child", and "jaya" (जया) means "success" or "victory". The development of Putrajaya started in the early 1990s.


== History and design ==

Prang Besar (Jawi: ڤراڠ بسر‎, alternately Perang Besar (Malayan for "Great War"), was founded in 1921 on land that was jungle, as a rubber plantation by British veterans of World War 1, hence the name. Its land area of 800 acres (3.2 km2) expanded to 8,000 acres (32 km2), and it was merged with surrounding estates, including Estet Raja Alang, Estet Galloway and Estet Bukit Prang.
Until 1975, what is today Putrajaya, along with adjacent Cyberjaya, were under the administration of Hulu Langat (Kajang) district.
The vision of a new Federal Government Administrative Centre to replace Kuala Lumpur as the administrative capital emerged in the late 1980s, during the tenure of Malaysia's fourth prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad. The new city was proposed to be located between Kuala Lumpur and the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Two areas were proposed: Prang Besar and Janda Baik of Pahang. The new name Putrajaya was chosen for the site.
The federal government negotiated with the state of Selangor on the prospect of another federal territory. In the mid-1990s the federal government paid a substantial amount of money to Selangor for approximately 11,320 acres (45.8 km2) of land in Prang Besar, Selangor. As a result of this land purchase, Selangor now completely surrounds two federal territories within its borders, namely Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya.
Planned as a garden city and intelligent city, 38% of the area is reserved for green spaces in which the natural landscape is enhanced. The plan incorporated a network of open spaces and wide boulevards. Construction began in August 1995; it was Malaysia's biggest project and one of Southeast Asia's largest, with an estimated final cost of US$8.1 billion. The entire project was designed and constructed by Malaysian companies with only 10% of the materials imported.The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997/1998 somewhat slowed the development of Putrajaya. 300 members of the Prime Minister's office staff moved there in 1999, and the remaining government servants moved in 2005. On 1 February 2001, the city was formally transferred to the federal government and declared Malaysia's third federal territory.In 2002, a rail line called KLIA Transit was opened, linking Putrajaya to KLIA in Sepang. The construction of the Putrajaya Monorail, which was intended to be the city's metro system, was suspended owing to high costs. One of the monorail suspension bridges in Putrajaya remains unused.
In April 2013, the Putrajaya government signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the government of Sejong City in South Korea to mark co-operation between the two cities.


== Government and politics ==
As of 2012 almost all of Malaysia's governmental ministries had relocated to Putrajaya. Government ministries and bodies remaining in Kuala Lumpur include the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Ministry of Works (KKR), as well as Bank Negara Malaysia and Royal Malaysian Police. The Parliament of Malaysia also remained in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaysia. Foreign embassies and missions also remained in Kuala Lumpur.
Local government in Putrajaya is the responsibility of the Putrajaya Corporation (Perbadanan Putrajaya), a special local authority. Previously it was administered by the Sepang District Council.
Putrajaya is represented in the Parliament of Malaysia by one elected MP in the Dewan Rakyat, under the seat of Putrajaya, as well as one appointed senator in the Dewan Negara.
As with the other federal territories of Malaysia, Putrajaya does not have a territorial legislature.
