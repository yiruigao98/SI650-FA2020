Phalia (Urdu تحصیل پھالیہ ) is a city and headquarters of Phalia Tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin District, Punjab, Pakistan.


== History ==
 
Alexander the Great and his army crossed the Jhelum in July 326 BC at the Battle of the Hydaspes River where he defeated the Indian king Porus.
According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), he built a city on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes now Jhelum River, which he named Bukephala or Bucephala to honour his famous and loyal horse Bukephalus or Bucephalus. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum City but that is wrong. Phalia was named after Bucephalus on the name of the Alexander's dead horse and presently a tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin District. The Alexander while forwarding from Taxila opted alternate way despite of using traditional route i.e. today's GT road and built two cities on opposite banks of the river Hydaspes en route between Bhera and Mong.
In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. 
Jalalpur Sharif is located on west of the river Jhelum whereas Phalia on eastern bank in Mandi Bahauddin District close to river Jhelum earlier known as Hydaspes. A semi hill or mound i.e. the historical sign of the ancient city and a shrine still available in mid of the Mohalla Ameer.  In 2010, maximum of the area reshaped into commercial land and precious heritage could not be preserved.
After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Bahawalnagar District. The Muslims faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of British rule, Bahawalnagar increased in population and importance.
The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in the Bahawalnagar District.
