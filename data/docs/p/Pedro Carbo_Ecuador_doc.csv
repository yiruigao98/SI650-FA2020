== History ==
The area now known as Pedro Carbo was once called "Rio Nuevo" (new river) and was an important town in the parroquia "San Juan de Soledad", now known as the town of Isidro Ayora (located to the east of Pedro Carbo). On August 1, 1893 the name was changed to Caamaño and was designated a rural parroquia of the cantón Daule, located to the east. The town kept the name Caamaño until 1895 during the Liberal Revolution, when its name was changed to honor Pedro Carbo Noboa. In the Territorial Division Law of 1897, the change was officially documented. Finally on July 12, 1984 the president of the Republic, Dr. Oswaldo Hurtado Larrea, declared the formation of Cantón Pedro Carbo, which was published in the Civil Registry N° 790 on July 19, 1984
