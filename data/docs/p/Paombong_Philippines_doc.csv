Paombong, officially the Municipality of Paombong (Tagalog: Bayan ng Paombong),  is a 3rd class municipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 53,294 people.Dubbed as the "Vinegar Capital of the Philippines", Paombong is famous for its vinegar extracted from the sap of sasa (nipa), thus the term "Sukang Paombong" (Paombong vinegar) became known in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines.


== Etymology ==
Local legend has it that the name "Paombong" was taken from the long bamboo tube called "bumbong" or "tukil" which is used for collecting nipa sap. The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbongs made the town known as the town with many bumbongs.
The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong.


== History ==
Paombong was originally one of the visitas (barrio) of Malolos mentioned in Capitulo XXXVI of Conquistas de Las Islas libro segundo by Fray Gaspar San Agustin. In a meeting held in Tondo Convent, the Provincial Chapter created the Town of Malolos in June 1580 with Fray Matheo de Mendoza OSA as its first minister, together with Barrios of Mambog under the patronage of San Roque,Matimbo with Santa Cruz and Paombong with Saint James Apostle. In 1619 Augustinians already established Paombong Convent but the town was administered by the justice of friars from Malolos. Paombong is not wealthy as its neighbor towns of  Malolos and Hagonoy at time and it did not sustain its township and it was degraded again as barrio and being a visita in 1638.
In 1639 Paombong was turned over to the Town of Calumpit from its mother town Malolos and in 1649 it was returned again to Malolos but on November 28, 1650 it was finally given its own civil government establishing Paombong its full township with Don Agustin Mananghaya as its first Gobernadorcillo.
In the middle of the 1750s, Paombong grew into a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs. as its first gobernadorcillo.
During the Revolution against Spain, Paombong’s coastal area, more specifically, Barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldiers and Katipuneros. Maloleño General Isidoro "matanglawin" Torres used to retreat with his troops to Barangay Masukol and Barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces. In the latter village, he organized the Katipunan militia of Paombong.It is from these encounters, in fact, that Barangays Binakod and Masukol earned their present names. In one encounter, Binakod was where the enemies where "fenced in" (binakuran) and it was in Masukol where they were eventually "cornered" (nasukol) and defeated.
In 1898, the first civilian in the person of Don Victorio de Leon headed the Municipal Government until 1900. The seat of the local government was first established at the ground floor of the Paombong Church Convent then popularly called "zaguan". It was later transferred to the house of Numerino Lindayag located in Poblacion, then was transferred to the location of the present Rural Health Center I. Eventually it was moved to the place where it is presently located which since has been the seat of the Municipal Government since then. In 1941, the head of the Municipal Government was later on called Municipal Mayor.
