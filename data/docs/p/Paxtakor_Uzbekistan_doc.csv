FC Pakhtakor Tashkent (Uzbek: Paxtakor Toshkent futbol klubi) is an Uzbek professional football club, based in the capital Tashkent. Pakhtakor literally means "cotton-grower" in English.
Pakhtakor was the only Uzbek club to play in the top-level Soviet football league and was the only Central Asian club to appear in a Soviet Cup final. Playing in the Uzbek League since 1992, the club has been the undisputed powerhouse in Uzbekistan since the fall of the Soviet Union, winning ten Uzbek League titles, including six in a row from 2002 to 2007. Pakhtakor also won seven consecutive domestic cups between 2001 and 2007, winning eleven cups in total. Players for the club have won Uzbek footballer of the Year honours eight times, and Pakhtakor teammates swept the top three spots in 2002. Club managers have been named Uzbek coach of the year twice.The team is also a perennial competitor in the AFC Champions League, having reached the semi-finals of the competition twice in 2003 and 2004. Pakhtakor currently holds the record in number of consecutive participations in the AFC Champions League, participating in 11 tournaments from 2002 to 2013.


== Name ==
The word Pakhta (پخته) in Persian means cotton and "kor" (کار) is from verb  کاشتن, ( kâshtan (Iranian Persian pronunciation), koshtan, kishtan (Tajik Persian pronunciation) ) which means "to cultivate"; so the combination "Pakhtakor" produces a job name and literally means cotton maker.


== History ==


=== The early Soviet period ===
Pakhtakor's first official match was on 8 April 1956, and is considered to be the club's "birthday". Its first match was played against a team from the city of Perm, Russia (then called Molotov city), presumably FC Zvezda Perm.  The first goal in Pakhtakor history was scored by Laziz Maksudov on a penalty shot and Maksudov's goal was the only and game-winning strike.The team was formed in three months, and the government invited the senior trainer Valentin Bekhtenev from Moscow to recruit the best Tashkent players for the new Pakhtakor.  At the time, the club was to represent Uzbekistan in Soviet football.In 1959, the club was promoted to the Soviet Top League for the first time.  During the 1960s, Pakhtakor's squad was anchored by the striker Gennadiy Krasnitskiy, who led it to a 6th-place finish in 1962.  After periods back and forth between the Top League and the Soviet First League, the club reached the final of the Soviet Cup competition in 1968 – the only Central Asian club to reach a Soviet Cup final – losing to Torpedo Moscow 1–0.In 1971, Pakhtakor again departed into the First League, but was not long detained in the lower division as it gained promotion the following year.Pakhtakor was the only Uzbek side to appear in the history of the USSR Championship during the Soviet era, appearing the highest echelon 22 times, and recording 212 wins, 211 draws, and 299 losses.  Their best league finish was 6th place, which they achieved twice, in 1962 and 1982.


=== Aircrash 1979 ===

In August 1979, Pakhtakor made it back to the Soviet Top League, but shortly thereafter disaster struck the club and Soviet football.  During a flight to play Dinamo Minsk, Pakhtakor's plane was involved in a mid-air collision over Dniprodzerzhynsk, Ukrainian SSR. All 178 people aboard both planes involved died.Seventeen Pakhtakor players and staff members died in the crash:

Pakhtakor had a point deducted that season due to exceeding the allowed limit for the games tied (drawn), but it did not influence the club's final standings.


=== The lean years: 1984–1990 ===
After leading Pakhtakor to its best finish, age finally caught up with Yakubik and he moved back to his hometown of Moscow to continue his football career. With the departure of their great forward, the club struggled and spent six years in the Soviet First League.  Although the discontent of their fans grew, Pakhtakor's reemergence as a major footballing force followed fast upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union.


=== Modern period, since 1992 ===
After the USSR collapsed, a new page began in the club's history. 1992 saw Pakhtakor participate in the first season of the Uzbek Oliy League. Since 1992 Pakhtakor have become the most successful Uzbek club with 10 Uzbek League titles, and 11 Uzbek Cups. Until 2014 the club is the only team to have participated in all seasons of the AFC Champions League since its inauguration in 2002. Since 2002 the club participated 11 times in AFC Champions League.
The participation in the AFC Champions League season 2011 was not successful. On 4 May 2011 in a match against Al-Nassr Pakhtakor lost and finished its Asian campaign. In that match, because of many injured players, Pakhtakor's coach Ravshan Khaydarov formed starting squad from youth team players and club made record in the AFC Champions League history as the youngest team of the tournament with average players age of 21,8. The average age of club players for season 2011 was 23,3. In 2014–15 seasons Pakhtakor won its 10th and 11th League champion titles.
