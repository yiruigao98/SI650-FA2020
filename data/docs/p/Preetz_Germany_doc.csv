Preetz (German pronunciation: [ˈpʁeːts]) is a town southeast of Kiel in the district of Plön, in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Preetz is also known as "Schusterstadt" (English: 'shoemaker town') named after shoemakers who used to live and work in this town.

== Geography ==
Preetz is located in a hilly area referred to as the Holsteinische Schweiz (Holstein Switzerland) with a number of lakes and forests surrounding the town.
Lakes include the Postsee, Lanker See and the smaller Kirchsee in the centre of town, which forms part of the river Schwentine. There are multiple nature reserves around Preetz that attract tourists and locals alike for biking and hiking, especially in the summer months.


== History ==

The first mention of Preetz dates from the year 1185, when Ecbrecht Procensis writes about the location Poretz in the Versus de Vicelino.  The origins of the name Preetz are said to be found in the Slavic term "po rece" (i.e., on the river). In 1221, the term "Poretzie" appeared, and in 1442 "Pretze".
A first town church was built in 1210. In 1211, Count Albrecht von Orlamünde established a Benedictine monastery: Preetz Priory. The foundation of the abbey was renewed by Adolf IV von Schauenburg in 1226, and it was given to nuns. In 1268, the nunnery church was built. The nunnery formed the highest administrative authority until 1867 and exercised jurisdiction as well.
Preetz obtained street lighting in 1852. The station was built in 1864, the Council Hall in 1871. An oak tree in front of the Council Hall, which was planted in 1871, still exists.
Limited city rights were awarded to Preetz on 17 May 1870, full city rights in 1901.
