The ancient Phrygian capital Gordion is 10 km from the city of Polatlı.  On his expedition to the east, Alexander the Great cut the famous Gordian Knot, an omen of his coming rule over the whole Asia.  Pessinus, an ancient city on the upper river Sangarios (modern day Sakarya River), is also within the borders of Polatlı.  The mythological Phrygian King Midas is said to have ruled from Pessinus and to be buried here.
Polatlı also occupied an important place in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 as the Battle of Sakarya (August 23-September 13, 1921) was fought here, the utmost eastern point reached by the advancing Greek Army in Anatolia.  There are two memorial burial grounds of those lost in the battle. There is also a monument named Mehmetçik Monument about the battle just 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) west of Polatlı.
