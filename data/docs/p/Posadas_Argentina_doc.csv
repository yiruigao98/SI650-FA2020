== History ==
Father Roque González y de Santa Cruz established a town called Anunciación de Itapúa on March 25, 1615, but ten years later the settlement was moved to the other side of the Paraná River to the present location of Encarnación, Paraguay.
The first settlement was not completely abandoned, and a new San José reduction was settled there in 1628. In 1867, during the Paraguayan War, the Brazilians set up the Trinchera de San José military base there. Following the end of the war, Paraguay renounced all claims to the area, and in 1879, the town was renamed after Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, the Supreme Director of the Argentine Confederation (1814).
On December 22, 1881, the limits of the Misiones Federation were drawn, leaving Posadas within the territory of current Corrientes Province. On July 30, 1884 the National Congress decided to give Posadas to Misiones Province, and name it its capital. The National University of Misiones was established at Posadas in 1973, and in 1990, the city's cultural and economic links to Encarnación were strengthened with the completion of the San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge.

== Origin of the population ==
The population mainly owns Spanish and indigenous ancestry (of the Avá ethnic group in its majority), generally resulting from the mixture of both parts and with that being the ethnic origin of the settlers who initially made up the city and also of the majority of those who arrived from the 20th century onwards from the rest of the province and especially from Paraguay (whith Paraguayans being the largest foreign group). Among those who migrated from the rest of Misiones there are also descendants of Germans (other people of that descent have migranted from southern Brazil in the first half of the 20th century), Poles and Ukrainians, as well as a small group of Mbyá indigenous people. Another little minorities are Romani, Ashkenazim and descendants of Italians and French, as well also immigrants from Colombia (who arrived since the late 2000s) and Asia (mainly Laotians of the Hmong ethnic group -who arrived in the late 1970s as refugees from the Laotian Civil War-, Japanese -who arrived in the mid-20th century- and Chinese -arrived from the 2000s-). Other immigrants who make up very small numbers and who generally arrived in the late-20th century or 21st century are Bolivians, Haitians (who are mainly university students), Peruvians, Senegalese, South Koreans and Taiwanese.
