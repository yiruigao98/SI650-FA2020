== History ==
Phuket is one of the oldest cities in Thailand.  It was an important port on the west of the Malay Peninsula where Chinese immigrants first landed. On 13 February 2004 the town was elevated to city status (thesaban nakhon, Thai: เทศบาลนคร).
The older buildings in Phuket town indicate its former prosperity. They were constructed when tin mining was an important on the island. The architectural style, called "Sino-Portuguese", is European mixed with Chinese modern. Characteristic is a single or two-storey building with a narrow front compensated for by considerable depth. The tiles, doors, perforated windows and other details are all influenced by Chinese and European styles combined. "Phuket Old Town" is a  2.7 km2 area covering a total of 210 rai. Ten streets—Klang, Phang Nga, Rassada, Dee Buk, Krabi, Thep Kasattri, Phuket, Yaowarat, Satun, and Soi Rammanee—define a quarter studded with heritage buildings. As of 2019, the Fine Arts Department and the Phuket provincial authorities are preparing a proposal to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) that Phuket Old Town be listed as a World Heritage Site.
