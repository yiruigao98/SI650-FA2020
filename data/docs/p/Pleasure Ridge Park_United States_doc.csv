Pleasure Ridge Park (often referred to simply as PRP) is a former census-designated place (CDP) in southwest Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 26,212 at the 2010 census. In 2003, the area was annexed to the city of Louisville due to a merger between the city and Jefferson County's unincorporated communities. Pleasure Ridge Park is now a neighborhood within the city limits of Louisville.
This community is served by the Pleasure Ridge Park Fire Protection District. The Pleasure Ridge Park Fire Protection District is one of seventeen volunteer and combination departments that make up the Jefferson County Fire Service. This department covers 56 square miles and serves the citizens of Pleasure Ridge Park and Valley Station in southwestern Jefferson County, Kentucky.
Pleasure Ridge Park High School is located in the area.


== History ==

The area was first sparsely settled by French and German Catholics in the mid-19th century, and the first church, St. Andrew's Church, was built in 1851, and although it no longer exists, a major local road still bears its name. What is now the Paducah and Louisville Railway built a station in the area in 1874, and a summer resort and hotel called Paine Hotel developed around a shaded ridge on Muldraugh Hill, what came to be called Pleasure Ridge. The name Pleasure Ridge Park was chosen for the first post office in the area in 1876. The area continued to be popular for tourism until World War I.
By the 1950s, the area began expanding rapidly as subdivisions were built. People moving to the area liked its cheap land and location reasonably close to both Downtown Louisville and Fort Knox. Residents blocked a 1984 attempt by the nearby city of Shively to annex Pleasure Ridge Park.

== Economy and growth ==

Although growth in Pleasure Ridge Park is fairly slow, the area has seen an increase in small-scale retail in the last few years. The first Starbucks opened in Pleasure Ridge Park in 2006 in the Dixie Manor Shopping Center. A new Super Wal-Mart opened as well in the city in March 2008 on the Greenbelt Highway. This shopping center also has a retail building built suited for several tenants. Since the completion of the Greenbelt, many subdivisions have been built along or near the belt to allow for easy access to I-264 and I-265. A popular teen nightclub, the Electric Cowboy, also opened in 2007 near the corner of Dixie Highway and Greenwood Road. This club opened in a newly built retail center that houses several other tenants.
There have been an abundance of new jobs in the Riverport area near the Ohio River. Many of these jobs have, of course, sprung up because of the UPS Worldport Expansion at the airport. Most of these jobs are in warehousing and logistics, but still provide the area with new employment opportunities.
