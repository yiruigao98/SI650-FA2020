It is one of the eastern suburbs of the city of Lausanne, located on the shores of Lake Geneva (Lac Léman) and at the foot of the vineyards of Lavaux on the road to Vevey and Montreux.


== History ==
Pully is first mentioned in 994 as Pulliacum.


=== Prehistory ===
In 1826 a neolithic cemetery with about 30 graves was uncovered at Pierra-Portray.  However, the artifacts were not fully preserved and only one flint blade and a soapstone fragment still exist.  Near Pierra-Portray, along the Chemin de Chamblandes, Albert Naef examined 23 tombs in 1901-10.  These tombs belonging to a similar set of tombs which were sporadically excavated and recorded between 1880-1993.  The local rectangular graves consisted of boxes assembled from four vertical slabs of about 1 meter (3.3 ft) in length, with a fifth plate that served as a lid.  The dead were lying on their left side with their legs drawn up to the chest and the head pointed to the east.  The largest find of stone box graves in Pully was the cemetery at Chamblandes.  Due to the number of finds at Chamblandes, all similar cist or stone box graves in the surrounding area came to be known as Chamblandes type graves.  The cemetery of Chamblandes extends over a length of about a hundred meters (yards) and included 76 graves and over 100 skeletons.  This Middle Neolithic (4300-3900 BC) graveyard included as grave goods; ocher, various commodities (polished stone ax) and jewelry (wild boar tusks, pendants made of shells, coral and lignite).  Two collars, one needle, a dagger and a bronze knife-blade hatchet are attributed to an early Bronze Age grave.  In 1992 a cremation grave was discovered that dated from the Late Bronze Age.


=== Roman villa ===
In the 1970s, while working on foundation of a terrace of the Le Prieuré building, the corner of a large Roman era villa was discovered.  The villa dates from the period between the second half of the 1st Century and 4th Century AD.  The accompanying small thermal baths, a monumental pool and several walls were already known from earlier excavations.  The heart of the east wing of the villa is a multi-level, semi-circular pavilion.  The lower hall is decorated with, in situ preserved, wall paintings which represent a chariot race.  The painting dates from the first quarter of the 2nd Century.  Finds from the 4th and 5th Centuries show that the site was also, at least partially populated, during the late antiquity period.  Between the 5th and 6th Century, the baths were converted into a Christian burial chapel with numerous burials.


=== Medieval Pully ===
During the Carolingian era the additional buildings were built around the burial chapel.  During the Early Middle Ages  (5th-7th century) a cemetery was operating at Les Deserts.In the 10th Century the royal family of Burgundy granted their vineyards at Pully to Payerne Priory.  The priory retained this land in Pully until 1536.  In 1079, Bishop Burkhard of Oltigen received some property from the Emperor in Pully.  This land had previously belonged to Rudolf of Swabia.  From then on, the Bishop of Lausanne possessed the jurisdiction right over the bailiwick of Pully.  The Bishop first granted the bailiwick to the Lords of Faucigny, then in 1276 to the de Thoire-Villars family.  Two officers, the Sautier or Weibel and the Seneschal, were responsible for the judiciary.  The Counts of Geneva, the Geneva-Lullin family, were the Seneschals until 1536 and were practically the rulers of Pully.  A number of other religious and secular leaders owned land or rights in the village.  Until 1555, the Counts of Gruyere were one of the largest landowners in the area.  In 1509, Bern and Fribourg mediated between the Count of Gruyere and the citizens of Pully.  The market buildings in Pully were used until at least 1558.The municipality began to become a partly independent town in the 13th century and received its charter (plaict général) in 1368.  The town was administered by a twelve-member council until 1719, when it became an eleven-member group.  The council was led by a knight banneret.


=== Early Modern and Modern Pully ===
In 1536, the town of Pully came under the administration of the cities of Bern and Lausanne.  Lausanne renounced their rights in 1717.  From  1536 until 1798 it belonged to the Bailiwick of Lausanne.  Then, from 1798 until 2006, it was in the district of Lausanne.  The Le Prieuré building was originally the priory court of the Priory of Payerne.  Under the Bernese it served as a wine cellar and vineyard house.
The original parish church was probably dedicated to St. Maurice starting in the 9th Century.  Between the 14th and 16th Century, it was rebuilt and consecrated to St. Germann.  It burned down in 2001 and was rebuilt again in 2004.  After the Reformation, the parish also included Paudex and Belmont, which became independent in 1897.  The parsonage was built between 1594 and rebuilt in 1723.  The church in Chamblandes dates from 1938, the one in La Rosiaz from 1953 and the Catholic Parish of St. Mauritius was created in 1954.
