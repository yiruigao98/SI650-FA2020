Nova União (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈnɔvɐ uniˈɐ̃w̃]) is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) academy and mixed martial arts team located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Their BJJ black belts have participated in BJJ, submission grappling and MMA competitions all over the world. BJ Penn's victory at the Mundials marked the first time a non-Brazilian native won gold in the black belt category. Since 2008 Nova União has become a familiar name in the Mixed Martial Arts scene as a result of stabling the former #1 ranked featherweight fighter in the world, José Aldo, as well as Renan Barão, the former UFC Bantamweight champion, and another top ten ranked featherweight in Marlon Sandro. Nova União is one of the top professional MMA training camps.
