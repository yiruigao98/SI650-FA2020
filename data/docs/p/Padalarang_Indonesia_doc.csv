== Lighting ==
As this toll road runs along hills which don't have access to electricity, PT Jasa Marga Tbk installs many solar street lights to brighten the road in the night. Along KM 104 - 105, many solar street lights are installed on the two lanes of the road. Nevertheless, there are also some electric street lights along the toll road, such as around KM 91 and KM 95.


== Road width ==
Generally, each lane of the toll road has only two rows because of the ground contour. But, in some narrow curve in the road, there is an extra row in the left side of each lane which is used by trucks, buses, and containers.
