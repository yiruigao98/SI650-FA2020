Ilobu is a town and the administrative headquarters of Irepodun Local Government Area of Osun State, Nigeria.
It is located in a sparsely forested area and is bounded on the north by Ifon-Osun, on the south by Osogbo, on the east by Oba and on the west by Erin-Osun. It is watered by Ojutu River, Erinle River, Konda River and a few other streams. The town is said to have been founded by Laarosin, a powerful warrior in the Old Oyo Empire. It has a population of about 30,825 (2006 census).


== People and culture ==
The Ilobu people's tradition and culture has to do with the way they live, govern themselves, their religion, language, dressing pattern, arts, festivals and the rules they set for themselves. They have a very strong sense of community and this has enhanced mutual understanding and meaningful development in the town.


== Arts and crafts ==
Ilobu is a big arts and crafts centre in Nigeria. These include metal crafts, weaving, painting and sculpturing and leather work. The dyeing of clothes known as "adire" is well known in Ilobu. It is a special art of tying and dyeing of clothes to bring out unique designs. It is very popular all over the world.


== Traditional religion beliefs ==
Erinle is an annual festival of worship within the town where ram with pounded yam and Sekete wine - a traditional wine - are used to worship. Everybody in the town, both males and females, worship Erinle with Olobu the king. On the fifth day, Erinle images would be brought out. Twenty-eighth day notice would be given, around August before the actual festival in September. Erinle had been worshipped before the arrival of Islam and Christianity. The ram would not be killed but would be thrown into the river alive. Akodo is the priest and there are many spots in the river called Ibus which represented where Erinle’s son are living.
The significance of the festival is linked to the continued peace, harmony and progress of the town. Despite the fact that majority of its populace are either Muslims or Christians, Erinle festival remains a rallying point for the natives of Ilobu in Osun State.


== System of administration ==
Politically, the Olobu enjoyed extensive power. He has legislative and judicial powers. He almost monopolised the right to impose or commute capital punishment and also controlled appointments to senior political offices. Though the Olobu has the right to choose his own chiefs, he is himself chosen by the kingmakers. In the palace, the Olobu has some palace officials called 'Oba ni nki o'. This is hierarchically set up with 'Baba kekere' as its leader. The 'Baba kekere' is chosen by the reigning Oba or his chiefs. The palace officials also include the palace chronicler in person of the Chief Drummer.
The Olobu rules the town through a chain of the most senior chiefs. The chiefs are known as 'llu' or 'Town Representatives'. The 'llu' is headed by Bara, who is regarded as next in rank to the Olobu. The other senior chiefs are Jagun, Balogun and Bale Gbobamu (Gbobamu Chief). Women also play active roles in the traditional and political administration of llobu and are given a voice through their political representative, Iyalode, who is assisted by her Otun Iyalode and Seriki, second and third in rank respectively.
Next to the llu, come the Bale (heads of households). The Bales represent their different households. They do not hold meetings together except when called together by the Olobu and his chiefs. The oldest man in the compound is usually elected as the Bale. It is required that all members of a household should be able to trace their descent from a common ancestor. The unit is strictly exogamous, and sexual relations between members are regarded as incestuous and are punishable by the gods of the community.
