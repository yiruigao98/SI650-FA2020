City and Islington College is a further education college in the London Borough of Islington, England, with five major centres, including a dedicated Sixth Form college. In 2005 the College completed a £64 million building programme, which was the biggest investment in accommodation in the history of further education in the United Kingdom.


== Capital City College Group ==
On 1 August 2016, City and Islington College merged with Westminster Kingsway College to form the WKCIC Group, trading as Capital City College Group (CCCG). On 1 November 2017, the College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London joined CCCG, making the Group the largest further education and training provider in London and one of the largest in the UK.


== History ==
The college was formed in 1993 through a merger of the City and East London College, North London College, Islington Adult Education Service and Islington Sixth Form College, which operated over 13 sites across Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets.Alongside the development of the new buildings, the management of teaching and learning was reorganised, and the five centres emerged.


== Centres ==
Twelve years ago the college was spread across 13 different sites and three boroughs, and some of the buildings dated back to the 19th century. There are now five centres in Islington, each one specialising in a particular set of subjects. The centres provide study and recreational spaces, all with the latest ICT equipment for teaching and learning.The five centres are:

Centre for Applied Sciences
Centre for Business, Arts and Technology
Centre for Health, Social and Child Care
Centre for Lifelong Learning
Sixth Form CollegeEach centre is focused on running particular courses and qualifications and each has its own community of students, teachers and support staff.


== Centre for Applied Sciences ==

In Angel, Islington, the centre building was officially opened by her Majesty’s Chief Inspector for Schools, David Bell, in May 2005, the same year that Ofsted rated the college’s science provision as outstanding.
Applied science courses range from Introductory Diplomas to Foundation Degrees and lead to professions that require specialist scientific knowledge such as forensics, optics, medicine, nursing and sports and fitness training.
Many of the staff have industry experience and there are links with prestigious London universities as well as professional organisations such as the Metropolitan Police.
In 2008, the college’s Science provision was rewarded yet again, winning the Queen’s Anniversary Prize, thus becoming the first general further education College to win the award twice. It was won for ‘Creating Pathways to Employment and Higher Education in the Sciences'.


== Centre for Business, Arts and Technology ==
The new £15 million building on Camden Road, designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects and built by William Verry with Sprunt Architects, was officially opened by the then Secretary of State for Education, Ruth Kelly, in January 2006. Subject areas include; ICT and Networking, Business and Management, Visual Arts, Performing Arts and Media from basic level through to Foundation Degree.


== Centre for Health, Social and Child Care ==

The centre offers both full-time and part-time courses in child care, health and social care, counselling, and advice and guidance, all taught at the Marlborough Building.
Childcare provision has been designated a Centre of Vocational Excellence.
Many of the centre’s students are in employment or decide to enter employment after college but growing numbers are progressing to university.
For those who want to gain a degree while working, the centre offers four foundation degrees at the Marlborough Building: Early Childhood Studies, Education (primary pathway), Health Sciences and Working with Young People and Young People Services (Learning Mentors).
Beauty Therapy, Barbering and Hairdressing are also taught here and make use of the on-site salon; ‘Oasis’, which was officially opened in January 2011 by celebrity hairdresser Andrew Barton.


== Centre for Lifelong Learning ==
In Blackstock Road, Finsbury Park, courses are offered for adults with learning difficulties and disabilities together with courses in beauty and complementary therapies.
The centre, designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects, specialises in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses. Although most of the students are adults, a special ESOL programme for young people is also available. Courses range from beginner to advanced level and include Maths and IT.

As well as academic courses, students are involved in extra-curricular activities with an enrichment programme, as well as opportunities for trips abroad and the chance to work with professional organisations like the Almeida Theatre, or participation in the Duke of Edinburgh award.
Students are able to choose from over 30 A-level courses for 16- to 18-year-olds in the following subject areas: English, Media, Humanities, Business Studies, ICT, Languages, Maths, Performing Arts, Sciences, Visual Arts and Design.Van Heyningen and Haward Architects won an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions to design the building in 1999 and work was completed in 2003.
