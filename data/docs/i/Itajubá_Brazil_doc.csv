== History ==
In the beginning of the 19th century, the region was mostly occupied by native Brazilians, the Puri-Coroados. In January 1819, priest Lourenço da Costa Moreira moved to the parish of Delfim Moreira (known at that time as Soledade de Itajubá). The place was deserted, since it was just a small village in the middle of the woods of the Serra da Mantiqueira, far away from a river. Moreira told the people in the settlement that its topography was unfavorable to its development. He invited them to move the village to a place closer to the Sapucaí River, down the mountains. About 80 families accepted the invitation and, on the morning of March 18, 1819 they moved. The next day, Moreira celebrated the first catholic mass in the new location. The new Itajubá was founded.  After comparisons of topography had been made, part of the population decided to build a new church.  Moreira then gathered the people and they moved the old church's pictures and items to the new church.
According to historians Geraldino Campista and J. Armelim Bernardo Guimarães, the name Itajubá means "water that falls on the rock" or "waterfall". There are several small waterfalls scattered in the vicinities of Itajubá.The town is also the site of the Federal University of Itajubá, founded in 1913, which offers degrees in several technical fields, and also three other regionally important educational institutions: the Centro Universitário de Itajubá - Universitas (Itajubá University Center), the Faculdade de Medicina de Itajubá (Itajubá College of Medicine) and the FACESM - Faculdade de Ciências Sociais e Econômicas do Sul de Minas (South Minas Gerais Economic and Social Sciences College).
