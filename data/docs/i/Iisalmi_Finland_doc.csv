However, Sweden lost its last war with Russia and had to surrender Finland to the Russian Empire in 1809.
Iisalmi gained its status as town in 1891.

One memorable event, of the many, is "Rompepäivät", which translates as "the days of old junk and stuff". People gather together bringing all kinds of old stuff imaginable, from small sewing needles to old tractors, for everyone to see and a lot of small things to be sold. Small numbers of old restored cars, trucks, motorcycles and tractors, some of them Finnish made, are displayed for others to see. Here people talk about "good old times" or wonder over "ancient artifacts". Sometimes some of the finely restored machines are for sale to anyone interested to buy—of course if they can afford it.
"Oluset" is a music festival organized each July annually. The main sponsor is local brewery company Olvi. "Oluset" roughly translates to "a few beers".
