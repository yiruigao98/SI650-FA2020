== History ==
In 1824 the road was completed linking Uberaba and Anhanguera on the border between Goiás and Minas Gerais.  The government installed a tax collection post and the site was called "Porto de Santa Rita" or just "Porto".  Soon a chapel was built dedicated to Santa Rita and the settlement was known as Santa Rita do Paranaíba, after the great river that divides Minas and Goiás.  In 1909 a suspension bridge was built over the river.  In 1909 Santa Rita do Paranaíba became a municipality.  In 1943 the name was changed to Itumbiara (from a Tupi–Guarani language, meaning "Pathway to the Waterfall"), after a road built by Engineer Inácio Pais Leme connecting the town with Cachoeira Dourada, 40 km. away.
