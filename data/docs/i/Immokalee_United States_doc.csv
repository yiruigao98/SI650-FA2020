Immokalee () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Collier County, Florida, United States.


== History ==

The region was occupied by the Calusa Indians and centuries later occupied by the Seminole, after they moved down from the northern part of Florida. Initially the settlement was known as Gopher Ridge by the Seminole and Miccosukee Indians. Immokalee means "your home" in the Mikasuki language.When the swamps were drained in the region, agriculture became the dominant industry. European-American hunters, trappers, Indian traders, cowmen, and missionaries moved in before the development of permanent villages. The first permanent settlement was founded in 1872. In 1921, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad extended its Haines City Branch south to Immokalee.  The railroad was removed in the late 1980s.The Immokalee area is heavily agricultural. It is one of the major centers of tomato growing in the United States. In 1960, CBS News anchor Edward R. Murrow reported on the working conditions in the surrounding farms for his Harvest of Shame report for CBS Reports, which described the harsh lives of migrant workers.

Immokalee is home to WCIW-LP, a low power community radio station owned and operated by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. The station was built by numerous volunteers from Immokalee and around the country in December 2003 at the fifth Prometheus Radio Project barnraising. WCIW broadcasts music, news, and public affairs to listeners in Spanish, Haitian Creole and several indigenous languages.
WAFZ-FM (92.1 FM) is a full-power FM radio station licensed to Immokalee, Florida. The station plays a variety of new and current hits in the Regional Mexican format. In the 1980s, WAFZ also played Tejano music on its sister station WAFZ-AM. In its beginnings WAFZ had been WZOR-AM 1490 and English programming adult contemporary music and news in the morning and until 3pm. Then it changed its format to Regional Mexican/Tejano. The early DJs that worked there were Gabino Soliz, "EL CHAVO ALEGRE", and Irma Ayala. The station continued on the air for a long time until the mid-1990s, when it went silent for a while until what is now WAFZ was bought by Glades Media Company LLC, and transmitted simultaneously what WAFZ-FM was playing (a regional Mexican format). The current format of WAFZ is a young Regional Mexican, playing newer top 40 hits of the genre.
WAFZ's programming is also heard on WAFZ AM 1490 in Immokalee.
