== History ==

Ibb has been occupied since ancient times, and due to its strategical importance, the Ottomans used it as an administrative centre. It thrived as a market town and the Ottomans established the Wednesday market in Ibb. Ibb was governed by a semi-autonomous emir until 1944, when the emirate was abolished. At times in its history many people have migrated to Ibb from areas of Yemen which had been experiencing drought, to find work in farming. In the mid 1950s there was reportedly an outbreak of smallpox in the city.German explorer, Hermann Burchardt, photographed the city in 1901, photos now held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.

Ibb is located at an altitude of 2,050 metres (6,730 ft) on a spur of Mount Shamāḥī. Due to its high altitude, Ibb has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cwa), and is one of the wettest areas of Yemen, typically receiving 800–1200 mm of rain per annum.
