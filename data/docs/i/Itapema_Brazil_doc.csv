== History ==


=== Colonization ===
The Azoreans already in the communities of São Miguel and Santo Antônio were responsible for the settlement of the bay of Porto Belo, where they helped found the parish of Porto Belo on December 18, 1824, later transformed into a village on October 13, 1832. The descendants of these immigrants, in the early 19th Century, populated the region of Itapema, giving its first administrative structure, on December 30, 1914,  with the creation of its Police District.
It is known that in 1852, it was assumed that some 980 Portuguese and Azorean descendants already lived in areas of the current municipality of Itapema. This figure refers to the number of 51 mills of cassava flour and sugar. It was very common for families to have both types of mills.
Demographic growth until the mid-nineteenth century was slow. From the end of this century, Itapema receives immigrants of German, Italian and Spanish origin who soon end up merging with the population of Azorean origin. These other peoples exercise little local cultural influence, since the festivities, such as the feast of the patroness - Our Lady of the Navigators - besides the games, such as Farra do Boi, Boi-de-Mamão and Cantorias do Terno-de-Reis and festivals of the Divine were brought and maintained by the Azoreans.
