== History ==
While archaeological artifacts show that the Iyo area has been settled since at least as far back as the Yayoi period (300 BC to 250 AD), the origins of the present city of Iyo can be traced back to the year 1635, when the Matsuyama han ceded the territory including Iyo to the Ōzu han.  The port at Gunchū, the heart of present-day Iyo, became the main commercial port for the Ōzu han and the surrounding community flourished.
On January 1, 1955, the town of Gunchū was merged with the villages of Kita-yamasaki, Minami-yamasaki and Minami-iyo to create the first incarnation of the city of Iyo.On April 1, 2005, Iyo absorbed the towns of Nakayama and Futami (both from Iyo District) to create the new and expanded city of Iyo.


== Economy ==
Iyo houses the national headquarters for Marutomo and Yamaki, food manufacturing companies that specialize in dried Bonito flakes.  Other main products include mikan and Nakayama chestnuts and other fruits and vegetables.  In addition, Futami has had some success in making its sunset a local tourist draw, creating a seaside park, a sunset museum and an annual sunset concert at its Shimonada Station.
