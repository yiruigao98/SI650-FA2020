== History of Ipojuca ==
The colonization of Ipojuca began in 1560, after the expulsion of the Caeté Indians and other tribes from the southern coast of Pernambuco. From there, the settlers could migrate to the fertile land of Ipojuca rich in massapê. The land is very suitable for the cultivation of sugar cane, which caused rapid agricultural expansion in the region. Among the pioneers were the Lacerda, Cavalcanti, and Rolim Moura families. When the Dutch invaded Pernambuco, several mills had already been established in the region. Many people in the city participated in resisting the Dutch. Under the leadership of Captain-mor Amador de Araújo, a battle broke out on July 17, 1645. The Dutch were defeated on July 23, 1645. After the victory over the Dutch, Ipojuca became one of the most important regions of the Colonial System. With two harbors- Suape and Porto de Galinhas - higher than the lowland of the northeast massapê, Ipojuca was part of the colonial triangular trade. Hens earned its name after the slaves that had arrived from Africa in that period. The Ipojuca district was established by Municipal Law Paragraph 2 - November 12, 1895. The town that emerged was centered on the village of Nossa Senhora do Ó, and then was transferred to the village of San Miguel de Ipojuca.
With State Decree No. 23 - October 4, 1890, the downtown area was restored to Nossa Senhora do Ó. There is controversy about the date Ipojuca was founded, but according to a vicar of the parish the date was around 1596.
The origin of its name comes from the Tupi guarani Iapajuque, which means Dark Water. It was also the deathplace of Canadian boxing champion Arturo Gatti.
