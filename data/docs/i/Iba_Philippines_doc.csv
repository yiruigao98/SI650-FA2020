== History ==
Iba was founded by the Order of Augustinian Recollect priests led by Fray Rodrigo de San Miguel in 1611 as the village of Paynauen. The early inhabitants of the town are called Zambals. They were later joined by the Ilocanos who migrated to the town which resulted in intermingling of customs and traditions. The Aeta people settled in the hinterlands and the majority of them dwelled in the Mount Pinatubo area. In 1680, the administration of the town was turned over to the Dominican priests until the civil government came to power. There are no available records as to when Paynauen was renamed to Iba.The municipality was named after the sour fruit "Iba", commonly known as kamias (Averrhoa bilimbi), which is abundant in the place.  Local folklore talks about the Spaniards who came to the town asking the name of the place, the natives shouted "Iba, Iba" thinking that the man was asking what they were eating. From then on, the place was called Iba.
The permanent capital of Zambales was moved from Masinloc to Iba because of its strategic location being on the central part of Zambales.  On August 28, 1901, American Civil Governor William Howard Taft held the historic session of the Second Philippine Commission establishing the Province of Zambales under the American rule held at Roman Catholic Church of Iba.
