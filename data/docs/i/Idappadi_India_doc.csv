== People ==
Most of the population is depending on Agriculture & Power Loom weaving. There are thousands of power looms standing idle due to a workforce that is focussed on migrating to other towns is search of higher pay in other industries.
Lack of irrigation projects has led to frequent draughts even though a large river (Cauvery) flows just 10 km from the town. Now the present Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami proposed diversion of 0.5tmcft of Mettur surplus water to Salem tanks for a total cost of 565 Crores. The above scheme might help plenty of non - irrigated Agricultural land to irrigate in Edappadi & Sankari Taluks which will enable the people in this area to be sustainable with agriculture. The main reason for the poverty of Edappadi is the lack of viable entrepreneurial opportunities, electricity and a strong work force.
