Irinjalakuda is a municipal town in Thrissur district, Kerala, India. Irinjalakuda is a revenue division and the headquarters of Mukundapuram Taluk. It is known for the Koodalmanikyam Temple and the Thachudaya Kaimals  who  had princely status  until 1971.


== Etymology ==
The name Irinjalakuda has been derived from "Iru" and "Chaal", meaning two streams. According to another legend, the origin of the name Irinjalakuda came from 'Irinjalikoodal'. 'Koodal' simply means merge, merging of two rivers.So it shows that Irinjalakuda may have gradually developed, from 'Irinjalikoodal', that derived from 'Inangikoodal', means merge. At present there is no river in Irinjalakuda, only the myth of river.Irinjalakuda can be derived from 'iru njyaala koda' ( ഇരുഞാലകൊട) i.e., donation of two worlds, which is what Mahabali is said to have done in the story of the Vaamanaavataaram.


== Mythological history and legends ==
According to Hindu mythology, Irinjalakuda was created by sage Parasurama. According to Keralolpatthi, out of the 64 gramas (villages) established in Kerala (Out of these 32 Malayala Gramas & half Thulu grama viz.Manjeswaram are in the present Kerala and 31 1/2 Thulu gramas in the coastal Karnataka.), Irinjalakuda was the head of some of them. Irinjalakuda was one of the most prominent among these Gramas (village societies). Boundaries of this grama extends up to  Aloor in the east and Kakkathuruthi in the west and later extended to Koodapuzha in the east. Like the other Gramas this 'Grama' also followed Sankara Smruthi(a modified form of the 'Chathurvarnia' system of society with some Kerala model variations which lay upon caste system based on the 'Manusmruthi').Another legend suggests that the origin of the name Irinjalakuda were heard, "Irunnu Salayil Koodai", and "Virinja Alu Kuda". There is a huge Banyan tree still standing in the centre of the Irinjalakuda spreading the branches to the sky like an umbrella.
The Thachudaya Kaimal is a spiritual dignitary of Kerala Hindus and the temporal ruler of the Koodalmanikyam Temple and its Estates. The line goes back into antiquity and is mentioned in the Skanda Purana. The Arms of the Kaimal and that of the temple bear the insignia of a coiled conch-shell with the words 'Manikkam Keralar'. With the 26th amendment of the Indian constitution in 1971, the Princely order in India was abolished and the Thachudaya Kaimals lost their position in the temple and its estates. It is now managed by a Trust managed by the District Collector although a vestige of former power lies in his being the chief trustee of the temple. 
The Devaswom was  allotted land to accommodate institutions such as the  Christ College, and for public use to facilitate development activities in the region. Much land that belonged to Koodalmanikyam was subjected to encroachment.
