== History ==
Itapuranga began in 1933 when Dominican friars from Goiás, acquired land from the government on the left bank of the Rio Canastra.  The name of the settlement was "Xixá", taken from the Xixazeiro tree under which the first mass was celebrated.  Joaquim Moreira da Silva opened the first general store and the town began to grow.  Soon a public school was built and a road opened to the city of Goiás.  In 1943 Xixá became a district of Goiás and the name was changed to Itapuranga, which means in the Tupi language "red rock" or "place of pretty rocks".  In 1953 it was dismembered from Goiás to form a municipality.
