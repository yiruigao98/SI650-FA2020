Irun (Spanish: Irún, Basque: Irun) is a town of the Bidasoaldea region in the province of Gipuzkoa in the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain. It lies on the foundations of the ancient Oiasso, cited as a Roman-Vasconic town during the period.One of the biggest towns in Gipuzkoa, its border town situation (it is located on the border between Spain and France, across the Bidasoa river from Hendaye), has made Irun into a commercial and logistic centre.  Irun railway station is a major break-of-gauge where the SNCF 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) standard gauge rails meet the 1,668 mm (5 ft 5 21⁄32 in) broad gauge Renfe ones. Currently Irun features a fair ground provided with modern exhibition and telecommunication facilities just at some 100 metres away from the actual borderline at the Santiago Bridge (river Bidasoa).
Irun is part of the conurbation of Txingudi bay with Hondarribia and Hendaye, the town being also involved in the Eurocité Basque Bayonne-San Sebastián  (fr).
One of its main festivals is the Alarde de San Marcial, a parade recreating an episode of the Peninsular War, held every year on 30 June. Its main sports club is the Real Unión where its football team plays in Spain's Segunda División B.
There are hot mineral springs in the town.
