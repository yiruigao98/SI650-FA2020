== History ==
Izúcar de Matamoros derives its name from the náhuatl word,  Itzocan,  which is composed from  itztli,  meaning "knife" or "flint,"  ohtli  meaning "path," and -can. Therefore, it means "Place of the flint path." Other interpretations suggest that it could mean "Place of painted faces," or "Place of obsidian" or "Place where obsidian is worked."
