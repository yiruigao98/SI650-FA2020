The Christian Reformed Church of Nigeria (CRC-N) is a Christian church that was established in 1951 under the name "Ekklisiyar Kristi a Sudan (EKAS) Lardin "Benue" meaning, "The church of Christ in Sudan, Benue region", and known under its current name since 1976. It belongs to the Fellowship of Churches of Christ in Nigeria (Tarayyar Ekklisiyar Kristi a Nigeria, TEKAN) and the World Communion of Reformed Churches.


== History ==
The Christian Reformed Church, Nigeria (CRC-N) came into being after many years of effort on the part of Sudan United Mission (SUM). In 1904 the SUM under the leadership of Dr. Herman Karl kum sailed to Nigeria together with others as Ambrose H Bateman, John Gunter and J Lowry Maxwell.
After, receiving permission by the then British High Commissioner in Northern Nigeria to establish at Wase, the party travelled from Lokoja and arrived at Ibi. From there they moved to Wase. Because of Islamic influence at Wase, the work did not go well. Mr. John Burt traveled to Wukari and there they made the first attempt to establish the mission centre. Dr. Lowry Maxwell went to Wukari from Ibi and preached the gospel there for the first time in 1905. Subsequently, he went to Donga with same message that same year.
Consequently, Wukari became a new Mission station. However, the work in Wukari met with poor response and the missionaries moved inland and establish at Donga a new station in 1907. The Church in Donga was constituted as a Church on 17 June 1917.
Between 1910 and 1920, several visits were made to Lupwe-Takum area for possible expansion of the gospel. In 1916, Mr. Filibus Ashu Angyu was sent to Takum to become an evangelist there. Thus, indigenous missionaries started work in Takum before white missionaries went there.
Rev. Whitman investigated Takum area and recommended that a station be opened at Lupwe. By 1919, Mr. William Nuckle Bristow built a station at Lupwe.
In February, 1921, Mr. Whitman and Miss Johanna Veenstra arrived Lupwe from Donga. About this time, there was revival at Wukari and Ibi. A congregation started at Ibi in 1922.
The gospel continued to grow due to the indigenous converts, who themselves became evangelists to their people. By 1936 Mr Edgar Smith and Siman Atajiri took the gospel to Nyita. There were converts there and the Chief of Nyita encouraged the people to embrace Christianity.
By 1937, Mr Istifanus Audu, Edgar Smith,Musa Chiroma and Habila Adda took the gospel to the Kurmi area. The Ndola,Tigon and Ichen people there embraced the gospel. A station was built in Baissa. The Takum Church sent people like Bulus Kweshi to become an evangelist in Ndoro area in 1942. Also, by 1943, the Takum church sent Mr Daniel Andeyantso to be an evangelist at Ashuku, a Tigon town. Again the Takum church sent Mr Dauda Mbo to Ndaforo. Thus, the gospel took root and grew in Kurmi among the Ndoro, Tiggon and Ichen people. It is worthy to note that all these indigenous workers were not ordained nor were they paid, but of voluntary service.


=== CRCNA Take Over ===
At the beginning in 1904, the Mission field under consideration was under the SUM British Branch. It was Johanna Veenstra that first came as a Christian Reformed member of the SUM branch from America. Johanna Veenstra linked the Mission field to the Reformed branch during her thirteen years of service. Before her death, she had prepared ground for Christian Reformed Church, North America (CRCNA) takeover of the mission field.
The process of taking over began in 1937. By 1939, the SUM. American Committee agreed to recommend the British branch of SUM that the Lupwe field should be given to the CRC. During the Synod of 7 July 1939, it was decided that Lupwe Takum Station should be taken over to become a CRC Mission project. This take-over also included Ibi, Wukari and Donga Stations. 
Therefore, in 1940 the Christian Reformed Church of America officially took over the Mission Field of the present CRCN.


=== Birth of an Indigenous Church ===
The indigenous church was formed during its first meeting at IBI on 25 July 1951 under the name "Ekklisiyar Kristi a Sudan (EKAS) Lardin "Benue" meaning, "The church of Christ in Sudan, Benue region" The name of the new church was publicised through conference. The leaders explained the new name to the people and unity was emphasized. The Trustee of the Church was registered by the government of Nigeria, in August 1960. The church therefore became legally constituted autonomous body incorporated under the LAND (PERPETUAL) ACT CAP. 98 in Lagos under the name Ekklisiyar Kristi a Sudan (EKAS) Lardin Benue.


=== Change of Name ===
Later the name EKAS was changed to "Ekklisiyar Kristi A Nigeria (EKAN). Political changes took place and Benue found herself in both Benue and Sardauna provinces since Baissa and Serti was located in Sandauna province. The name therefore changed to EKAN Benue and Sardauna (EKAN 4BS.)
In 1967, twelve states were created, Takum-Wukari and Donga stations were found in the then Benue Plateau State. Further then in 1976, when additional states were created, the old problem resurfaced as the church found herself to be in the (then) Gongola State and part of Benue State. At this point, the church decided to change her name to reflect that of the Mission which had originally established her, so as to avoid further complication by political changes, the church became known as the "Christian Reformed Church of Nigeria." (CRCN)
The leaders of the church used to be called "Chairmen" but now the heads of the denomination are called "Presidents".
