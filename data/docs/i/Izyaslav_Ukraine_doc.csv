Izyaslav was first mentioned in 1390. It was a private town of Poland, owned by the families of Zasławski and Sanguszko. It was part of Polish Volhynian Voivodeship. In 1583 it was granted Magdeburg city rights.
After the Partitions of Poland Izyaslav was part of the Russian Empire - Volhynian Governorate.
At the beginning of World War II, the town had an important Jewish population representing 28% of the total inhabitants. As soon as the Germans occupied the town, Jews were kept imprisoned in a ghetto and later murdered in mass executions perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppen.
