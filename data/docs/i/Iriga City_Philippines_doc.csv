Mount Iriga, also known as Mount Asog, is one of the active volcanoes in the Philippines, in the province of Camarines Sur, in the Philippines.
Mount Iriga is a stratovolcano about a kilometre from Lake Buhi. It rises 1,196 m (3,924 ft) with a base diameter of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi). It has a large crater probably formed from a huge eruption.
Iriga erupted in 1628 and 1642. Iriga is generally known for its phreatic explosions. After these eruptions, it remains dormant as of now.
