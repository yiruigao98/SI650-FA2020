== History ==
In the Edo period, Ikeda had a castle occupied by a daimyō, the seat of a 50,000-koku domain. It was famous for Ikeda-zumi (Ikeda charcoal) traded by Ikeda merchants. In cha no yu Ikeda-zumi is loved because of its high quality even today.
The city was founded formally on April 29, 1939. It was developed as an urban town by a local railway company, Hankyu Dentetsu. Its founder Kobayashi Ichizo (Itsuo) lived there.
On June 8, 2001, the Osaka school massacre occurred in this city. A man entered an elementary school and fatally stabbed eight children in the school. Many pupils have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. To avoid flashback memories of the massacre and to improve school security, the buildings were remodeled and subsequently occupied in April 2004. On September 14, 2004, Mamoru Takuma was executed for the murders.
