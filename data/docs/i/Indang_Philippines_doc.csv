== Etymology ==
Indang (originally called Indan) was established as a town in 1655, when it was administratively separated from the nearby town of Silang, Cavite. Indang derived its name from the words "Inrang" or "yndan", a tree which was also called "Anubing". The tree of Inrang was used to be abundant in the local since the early times.


== History ==


=== Before 1655: Separation and Independence ===
Indang was part of Silang, Cavite for about 70 years, the municipality of Indang was organised with a prominent native, Juan Dimabiling, as the first gobernadorcillo. The distance between the barrio of Indang and the poblacion of Silang caused the residents of the former great difficulty in transacting officials business and attending religious services. This led the people of Indang to petition higher authorities for the conversion of the barrio into a separate municipality. The exact month and day of the municipality’s establishment has no verification. However, existing documents proved that Indang was instituted during the cold month of 1655. Therefore, the municipal government decided and declared December 1 as "Indang Day" which was annually celebrated and thereafter by its people.


=== 1896-1897: The Philippine Revolution ===
During the Philippine Revolution, Indan was known by its Katipunan name "Walang Tinag". It was also during this time that the letter "g" was added to its name; thus it is now called Indang. It belongs to the Magdiwang faction, which rivaled the Magdalo faction headed by Emilio Aguinaldo. In Barangay Limbon, Andrés Bonifacio was arrested after being defeated in the Tejeros Convention and prevented from pursuing his counter-revolutionary plan according to witnesses. One of these witness was Severino de las Alas, a resident of the town, who accused Bonifacio of trying to burn the Church of Indang, dedicated to the town patron, Saint Gregory the Great, built in the 17th century and one of the oldest in the province. He later served in Aguinaldo's government as Interior Secretary.


=== 1906-1998: Cavite State University ===
The Cavite State University began here in 1906 as an intermediate school and was later transformed into a high school. Named after Severino De las Alas in 1958, it later become a college in 1962 and in 1998 earned university status.


=== 2008-2015: Tagaytay Water Crisis ===
In 2008, Previous Mayor Bienvenido Dimero issued a certification to PTK2 H20 authorising it “to utilise, use, or tap” four rivers in Indang. After the certification in 2008, the company began ground clearing operations and excavation in Barangay Kayquit II.Meanwhile the Save Waters of Indang Movement criticised the DENR Region IV-A for issuing an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) without the required Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that would assess the possible environmental hazards the project would cause.PTK2 H2O also only secured the ECC after the water permits were issued.
"In other words, the ECC is incomplete and issued as an afterthought. Under the law, the ECC and the requisite EIS are conditions prior to and not after the issuance of permits," reads the petition.The ECC allows the company to build an intake structure, booster pumps, flocculation and sedimentation basin, pressure filter tanks, effluent channels, booster pumping stations, water pipes, and administration buildings in Barangay Kayquit II.The project also led to the cutting down of trees, which also allegedly lacked an ECC.

In 1980, a separate distribution pipe and ground reservoir in Barangay Kaytambog was included in the system. Total registered concessionaires were 463 as of August 1980. Water production from the spring source is 580 cubic metre of which only 26.6 percent is accounted for. The total water demand for various design years is derived from the demands for domestic, commercial, institutional and public faucets demands including an allowance for leakage and wastage. The possible sources of water supply for Indang are springs, namely, Ikloy, Ipie I and Ipie II.
