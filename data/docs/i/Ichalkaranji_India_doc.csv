== History ==
Ichalkaranji was a Maratha Princely state situated on the banks of Panchganga River (Marathi: पंचगंगा नदी). It was ruled by a chitpavan brahmin Ghorpade family for  two centuries until 1947.
The dynasty of Maratha rulers of Ichalkaranji has its origin in the middle of the seventeenth century. At that time, a poor Brahmin widow, by the surname of Joshi, from the coastal Konkan village of Mhapan, near Vengurla, in the present-day Sindhudurg district, moved east over the mountainous Western ghats with her seven-year-old son, Naro Mahadeo, to the village of Kapshi. The Maratha general Santaji Ghorpade, hailed from that village. Naro Mahadeo early took a keen interest in the cavalry horses of the general, and one day persuaded a syce to allow him to ride a fiery warhorse to the river to drink water. This stolen ride was observed by the alert Santaji, who roundly scolded the syce, but also began to take a deep interest in the prodigal boy, who rode so well without any formal training. Benefited by the general's personal attention. Naro, in turn, served Santaji loyally and both developed affection for each other. Naro performed heroically and gallantly. As Naro Mahadeo proved his ability, he was promoted and later on was rewarded with tax collecting fiefs(Inams). Out of gratitude to his benefactor, Naro went on to change his surname from Joshi to Ghorpade, which to this day is the surname of the dynasty of rulers of Ichalkaranji.
Venkatrao, the son of Naro Mahadeo married Anubai, the youngest daughter of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat, who very soon became the Prime Minister, or Peshwa, of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj. Because of this alliance with the Peshwa family, the rulers of Ichalkaranji came into more and more prominence. Venkatrao becoming a Sardar of Shahu Maharaj, and receiving additional Inams and grants from time to time because of his prowess and great ability as a general, fighting against the forces of Kolhapur and Portuguese from Goa.As described by Horace George Franks in the book The Story of Ichalkaranji (1929), there were ups and downs. But the women of the House of Ichalkaranji rulers were always ready to defend and also advance the interests of Ichalkaranji with as much courage and shrewdness as the men. An outstanding example of this is Anubai, the wife of Venkatrao.
