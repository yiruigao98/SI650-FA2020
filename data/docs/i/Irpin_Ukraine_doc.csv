== History ==
Since the 17th century on territory of Irpin, there was a village of Romanivka and khutir Lyubka. In the 19th century there appeared Severynivka village and khutirs Rudnya and Stoyanka.
Irpin was formed in 1899 as a passing loop, during construction of the Kyiv—Kovel railway line. Railway workers founded the town near the railway road along with other localities such as Bucha and Vorzel. The city's name (along with the city of Vorzel) was chosen due to its location on the Irpin River.
From July 26, 1941, right after the Battle of Kyiv, it was occupied by the Wehrmacht until early February 1944. Most of its Jewish population was killed in either Babi Yar or other massacres.
In 1956, Irpin's status was changed to that of a "city of raion (district) subordination," subordinate to the Kyiv-Sviatoshyn Raion (district).
On December 30, 1962, the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR issued a decree changing the status of Irpin to that of a "city of oblast subordination," thus being directly subordinate to the oblast authorities rather than the city administration housed within the city. Also mentioned within the decree were the inclusion of the urban-type settlements of Bucha (a city since 2007), Vorzel, Hostomel, and Kotsiubynske within the city limits.
