Maiti Nepal (Nepali: माइती नेपाल) is a non-profit organization in Nepal dedicated to help the victims of human trafficking. Currently, it operates a rehabilitation home in Kathmandu, as well as transit homes at the Indo-Nepal border towns, preventive homes in the countryside and an academy in Kathmandu .
The word ‘Maiti’ has no literal interpretation in English but in the Nepali language the word ‘maiti’ means the home of the girl's birth parents. The word itself holds sentimental value for the women population of Nepal “especially for a married Nepali woman who has no longer any right towards her parents or their property”. Once a girl is married to another man, she becomes a perpetual member of her husband's family. She has all obligations to her husband and her new family. As this organization is a home to all the girls, women and children who are not accepted into their family and society, therefore this NGO has been named as ‘Maiti’ Nepal to symbolize the love and affection that a girl receives in her birth parents place.


== History ==
Maiti Nepal was established in 1993 by a group of socially committed professionals in order “to protect Nepali girls and women from crimes like domestic violence, trafficking for flesh trade, child prostitution, child labor and various other forms of exploitation and torture”. Since 1993, this organization has been working towards “preventing trafficking for forced prostitution, rescuing flesh trade victims and rehabilitating them”. After rescuing women and children, this organization also works vigorously towards finding “justice for the victimized girls and women by engaging in criminal investigation and waging legal battles against the criminals”. Due to continuous efforts, this organization has been able to raise awareness regarding this crucial issue of girl trafficking at international levels.

After several years of violence, abuse and three miscarriages, she separated from her husband. 
Anuradha Koirala established Maiti Nepal in 1993 with the aim of providing services for both children and women who have endured untold pain and suffering, often in silence.

== Criticism ==
Though Maiti Nepal has successfully rescued thousands of girls from trafficking, the “critics of Maiti Nepal were of the view that Maiti Nepal did not always respect the will of the women concerned and refused drastic measures to deal with the problem”.One of the major drawbacks of Maiti Nepal's work has been in rehabilitating the former prostitutes. The other criticism raised against this organization's work is with its affiliation with an Indian Organization named STOP. STOP has been accused of raiding brothels at midnight and then taking away the girls forcefully and later subjecting them to various kinds of threats. Since Maiti Nepal is affiliated with STOP so when this organization is accused of any issue then it ultimately becomes a concern for Maiti Nepal as STOP hands over all its rescued girls to Maiti Nepal.
In May 2013 the Nepalese Supreme Court ordered Maiti Nepal to release a woman the court determined was being held against her will for the purpose of counselling her for being a lesbian.
