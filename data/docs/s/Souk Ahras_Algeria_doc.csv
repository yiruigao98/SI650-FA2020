Souk Ahras (Berber: Tagast; ancient name: Thagast; Arabic: سوق أهراس‎) is a municipality in Algeria. It is the capital of Souk Ahras Province. The Numidian city of Thagaste (or Tagaste), on whose ruins Souk Ahras was built, was the birthplace of Augustine of Hippo and  a center of Berber culture. It was a city of great culture, described as the very hub of civilization.


== Etymology ==
The name derives from the Arabic word souk which means "market", and the Chaoui Berber word ahra (plural ahras) which means "lion", in reference to the Barbary lions which existed in the neighboring forests until their extinction in 1930; hence Souk Ahras means "market of lions" (see also Oran (Wahran) and Tahert for names with a related etymology).

The old name of the Numidian city of Thagaste, derives from the Berber Thagoust, which means the bag, given that the site of the town is located at the foot of a mountain surrounded by three peaks in the form of a bag containing the city. Subsequently, when the Arabic language entered in the region it was called Soukara. In other sources it is cited as the Palace of the African, according to Al-Masudi.


== History ==


=== Prehistory ===
The town of Souk Ahras, as its region, experienced Aterian culture from the end of the Middle Palaeolithic to the early upper Palaeolithic Ages. After the Aterian, Souk Ahras was inhabited by people of the Capsian culture. Many stone tools dating to this period have been discovered. Stemmed arrows were found on the site of present-day Souk Ahras, but also in Tiffech and Taoura, not far from it.


=== Antiquity ===
It was the birthplace of Augustine of Hippo (born 13 November 354 CE) to Monica of Hippo (Saint Monica), he later the Bishop of Hippo and Saint Augustine. Souk Ahras (Thagaste) has played an important role in the political and cultural history of the region because of its strategic position at the crossroads of Numide, Ancient Roman, and Berber civilizations. It was the location of military fortifications (Madaure, Tiffech, Khemissa...) and urban centers.


==== Thagaste ====
Tagaste was a town of Numidia in Roman North Africa, on the banks of the Oued Hamise river.  Augustine of Hippo was born here.
The Roman city is identified with ruins of  Tajilt  near Souk Ahras, Algeria.
The Numidian city of Thagaste or Tagaste, on whose ruins Souk Ahras was built, was situated in the north-eastern highlands of Numidia. It was about 100 km (60 miles) from Hippo Regius, (present day Annaba), 32 km (20 miles) southwest of Thubursicum (present day Khamissa), and about 240 km (150 miles) from Carthage (on the coast of present-day Tunisia).
Thagaste became a Roman municipium. The city was mentioned by Pliny the Elder. As a municipium, Thagaste was not settled by Roman Italian immigrants, but was inhabited by Romanized native Berbers.


=== Modern era ===
In 1830 Souk Ahras became a colonial settlement of French Algeria (1830–1962). Late 19th century connection via the Algerian Railway, and 20th century iron ore and phosphate mining, brought some modern significance and prosperity to the town.
During the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962), Souk Ahras housed the Ouled Bechiah Mounts as an autonomous military base of the Army of National Liberation (ALN), called "Basis of the East".
