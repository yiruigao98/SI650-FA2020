This is a list of the highest settlements by country.  Only permanent settlements occupied year-round are included.  When possible, the highest point in the contiguous year-round settlement is listed, though average heights or the elevations of a central point may also be found.
The elevation of a towns or city affects the social and physical arrangement of the place. In many cases, the cold climate in winter necessitates a particular style of house; the type of agriculture practised and the domestic animals kept there are limited; or, the type of work carried on is specialised.
