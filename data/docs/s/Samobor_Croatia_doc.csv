== Monuments and sightseeings ==

Samobor is one of the earliest tourist resorts in the region, with the first tourist facilities dating back to 1810, catering to anglers, hunters and hikers. The town's beautiful surroundings and vicinity to the capital have supported this tourist tradition to the present day. In 1846, Samobor was paid a visit by the composer Franz Liszt, who at that time was visiting Zagreb during one of his numerous concert tours. Liszt came to Samobor to see his friend Ferdo Livadić, in his lodgings at the Livadić mansion, which is today the town museum.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Livadić mansion came under the ownership of a Jewish family named Daničić. They were forced to leave as a result of the Nazi invasion in 1941. Shortly after this, the mansion was
confiscated by the newly formed Independent State of Croatia and never returned to the Daničić family.

On Tepec hill, only 10 minutes walk from the city centre, there are still-visible remains of the Samobor Castle fortress built in the 13th century.
