== Landmarks ==


=== St. Aloysius Gonzaga Church ===

Its fa√ßade can compare immeasurably with existing Spanish-style church edifices and architectural design. The church is located in a place that used to be called Cabagsac, referring to the proliferation of fruit bats. In fact, today, a fishnet is permanently installed high above the altar precisely to catch thousands of bats that are roosting inside the church. The interior is dark, has an ambience of antiquity and mystery and overpowering odor of bat urine. The main attraction is the three-tower facade, perhaps one of its kind in the country. Not to be missed is the ancient cemetery located in a hidden corner at the back of the church, with some tombstones dating back to the 1800s and bearing the names of the town's prominent families, including the Elizaldes, Ablazos, Francos, Tarucs, among others.


== Education ==
There is a prime school in the town aside from public elementary and high schools.


== Notable people ==
Luis Taruc (June 21, 1913 - May 4, 2005), founder and leader of Hukbalahap, was born of peasant folks in the farming town of San Luis, Pampanga.
