Sundbyberg Municipality (Sundbybergs kommun or Sundbybergs stad) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden, just north of the capital Stockholm. Sundbyberg is wholly within the Stockholm urban area and has a 100% urban population.
Sundbyberg was detached from Bromma (which since 1916 is in Stockholm Municipality) in 1888 as a market town (köping). It got the title of a city in 1927. In 1949 parts of Solna Municipality and Spånga (when the rest of Spånga was amalgamated into Stockholm) were added. A proposed merger with Solna in 1971 was never implemented, making Sundbyberg, with an area of 8.83 square kilometres (3.41 sq mi), the smallest municipality in Sweden, but also the most densely populated. The municipality prefers to call itself a city, which, however, has no legal significance.


== History ==
Sundbyberg was for a long time only an area of small agriculture value and most of all used as a place to spend summer for rich families in the city. In 1863 almost the entire area was bought by Anders Petter Löfström, including Duvbo Estate, who began building houses there. In 1870 the first industrial plot was sold and from there the town did expand with railroad, houses, industries and community services of all kind. A. P. Löfström also donated to the municipality, all  land for roads, streets, parks, school, church and other public areas.
In 1888 Sundbyberg municipality was formed with 1,133 inhabitants, splitting off from Bromma. At the time the municipality only constituted Central Sundbyberg. Sundbyberg was known in its early years for its beer, its spirited political discourses, its muddy streets, and the danger of the streets at night (nowadays the crime-hit areas are Hallonbergen and Rissne instead)). Sales of land was aimed at workers and industry, and the relative lack of public services caused a strong cooperative spirit to form. While trains stopped in Sundbyberg, they did so at a low frequency, and most commuters used the steam boat. In 1910 a tram line was build from Stockholm and Råsunda to the municipal border, and then into Sundbyberg in 1928, lasting until 1959.In 1946 Sundbyberg municipality, which by then had 15,000 inhabitants, bought Storskogen, with the first homes going up there in 1952. In 1949 Spånga municipality was split between neighbouring municipalities, giving Duvbo, Ursvik and some other land to Sundbyberg. Lilla Alby was transferred from Solna municipality to Sundbybrg at the same time. By this time Central Sundbyberg was losing its industrial character. Since the 1950s when Storskogen was built, Sundbyberg has expanded one district each decade, with Ör built in the 1970s, Hallonbergen and its metro line (which also serves Storskogen and Ör) in the 1970s, Rissne and its metro line (which also serves Central Sundbyberg and Lilla Alby) in the 1980s, Brotorp and Stora Ursvik in the 2000s.


== Economy ==
The roughly 50,000 inhabitants live in about 20,000 households. The industrial policy of the municipality is to provide one job opportunity for every household, with there being around 23,000 jobs in the municipality (in 2015). So unlike other municipalities in Metropolitan Stockholm, Sundbyberg is not a bedroom suburb wherefrom people commute to Stockholm, but also a place commuted to from outside. In total, 19,000 commuters travel in each direction to or from Sundbyberg every day (in 2014). The most common professions for people working in Sundbyberg are (in order from most employed) IT developer, banker, human relations, secretary, business seller/purchaser, accountant, retail clerk, truck/bus driver, teacher, tax collector. In the first half of its existence, Sundbyberg saw a strong expansion of industrial activity, and most residents were industrial workers. In the 1940s the industry almost entirely disappeared from Sundbyberg. By the 1970s warehouses and IT businesses have established themselves instead, and an attempt to establish industry in Hallonbergen had failed due to high rental costs. Today the service sector dominates, with Sundbyberg having become a place with office workers, as a result of Sundbyberg becoming more central as Stockholm has expanded and public transport has been strengthened.The unemployment rate in Sundbyberg closely tracks the average for Stockholm County and is generally lower than the Swedish average.Unusually for Stockholm suburbs, Sundbyberg has a proper town centre, with  plenty of nice shops in the Central Sundbyberg area, which makes the little city a bit independent. There are also smaller concentrations of stores elsewhere in the municipality, such as by the Rissne and Hallonbergen metro stations.

=== By district ===


== Public transportation ==

Sundbyberg is well served by the Stockholm public transport system. There are several metro stations as well as one Stockholm commuter rail station and plenty of bus routes. Even some main line trains call at Sundbyberg. The Tvärbanan light rail service was extended from Sickla Udde via Alvik to Solna centrum in October 2013. The line runs through Central Sundbyberg with tracks laid in the street and has two stops within the municipality. Construction of a northern light railway branch from Ulvsunda to Kista that will pass through Rissne and Stora Ursvik started in 2018.
