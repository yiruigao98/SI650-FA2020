== Economy ==
Spring Hill was the site of the Saturn Corporation production facility, which operated from 1990 to 2007. The Saturn S-Series, Saturn ION, and Saturn VUE were produced there. In 2007, General Motors Corporation (GM), the parent company of Saturn, shut down the facility to retool it for production of other GM vehicles and renamed it Spring Hill Manufacturing. The plant reopened in February 2008 and became the assembly point for the new Chevrolet Traverse. However, after a battle among plants in Spring Hill, Orion Township, Michigan and Janesville, Wisconsin, GM announced on June 26, 2009 that they had chosen to build a new small car in Orion Township.  Nearly 2,500 Spring Hill auto workers were faced with lay-off, buy-out and early retirement. The vehicle assembly part of the Spring Hill plant was idled in late 2009 when production of the Traverse was moved to Lansing, Michigan, while production of power trains and metal stamping continued. In November 2011, GM announced plans for retooling of the vehicle assembly portion of the plant for use as an "ultra-flexible" plant which will initially be used to build the Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain but will be designed for rapid retooling to other vehicles of similar size.Spring Hill has gone through rapid development and growth in recent years, causing General Motors to reopen their auto plant and begin hiring locally again, which will hire 1,000 new people. In addition, companies such as Ryder and Goodwill have announced new facilities in the Spring Hill area.
