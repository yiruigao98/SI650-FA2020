== History ==
The land had been occupied for more than three centuries, since the establishment of the Iroquois mission in 1676, it is only in 1937 that the founding of la paroisse de Sainte-Catherine de Laprairie really marks a territorial organization. In 1973, a demographic boom finally granted the status of town to the village. In 2006, according to the city's official site, there were 17,000 inhabitants in Sainte-Catherine.
The inauguration of the Honor√© Mercier Bridge in 1934, and then of the Champlain Bridge in 1962, greatly boosted the local economy.
