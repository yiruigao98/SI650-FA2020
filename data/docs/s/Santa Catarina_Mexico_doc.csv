Santa Catarina is a city in Santa Catarina Municipality in the state of Nuevo León,  Mexico that is part of the Monterrey Metropolitan area.

The name of this city comes from the Catholic Saint Catherine of Alexandria.
The city of Santa Catarina was not "founded" in a traditional manner; at the beginning, it was only a resting point for travelers between Monterrey and Saltillo.  The first recorded name was "Estancia de Santa Catarina" (Shelter of Santa Catarina).
During the French Invasion of Mexico in the second half of the 19th century, the  president Benito Juárez spent some days in Santa Catarina while traveling to Monterrey, and it was during this time that he elevated its status to Village. The category of Village was maintained until 1979 when the state government elevated its status to City.
