The COVID-19 pandemic in Ivory Coast is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have reached Ivory Coast in March 2020.


== Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Model-based simulations for Côte d'Ivoire point to a 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t below 1.0 in July and August 2020, having previously fluctuated around 1.Côte d'Ivoire's census, planned for April 2020, may be delayed, given government containment and restrictions on internal travel. Tablets from China were delayed beyond the expected delivery in January.
