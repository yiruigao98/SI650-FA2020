Agriculture and its related derivates are at the heart of Saint-Hyacinthe's economic infrastructure. The city has been nicknamed the "Agricultural technopolis of Canada", because it is home to several research institutions in the field such as the centre de recherche sur les aliments (CRDA), the Institut de recherche et développement en agro-environnement (IRDA), the institut de technologie agroalimentaire (ITA) and the head office of the Artificial Insemination Center of Quebec (CIAQ).
Saint-Hyacinthe hosts numerous agriculture related events such as fairs, exposition and congresses and acts a hub in the field. So much so that the Agricultural Hall of Fame of Quebec decided to move there from Quebec City to give itself more visibility in the community.In addition, it is also home to Orgues Létourneau and Casavant Frères, builders of pipe organs, and Intact Financial, formerly known as Le Groupe Commerce.
