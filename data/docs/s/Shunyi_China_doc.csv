The Beijing 2008 Olympics rowing, canoeing, and kayaking events were held at the newly built Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park.
When Beijing Capital International Airport was first built, Shunyi was a subdistrict of Chaoyang. When Shunyi was promoted to full districtship, Chaoyang maintained direct control over the airport, so although the airport is completely surrounded by Shunyi district, it is not administratively in Shunyi; it pays its taxes to the Chaoyang government.
