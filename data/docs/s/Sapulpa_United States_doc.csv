== History ==


=== Early history ===
The town was named after the area's first permanent settler, a full-blood Lower Creek Indian named Sapulpa, of the Kasihta tribe, from Osocheetown in present-day Alabama]]. About 1850, he established a trading post near the meeting of Polecat and Rock creeks (about one mile (1.6 km) southeast of present-day downtown Sapulpa). When the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (later known as the Frisco) built a spur to this area in 1886, it was known as Sapulpa Station. The Sapulpa post office was chartered July 1, 1889. The town was incorporated March 31, 1898.


=== Controversy over Creek County seat location ===
After Oklahoma became a state, each county held an election to determine the location of the county seat. Sapulpa competed with Bristow as the county seat of Creek County. After five years of contested elections and court suits, the question was settled by the Oklahoma Supreme Court on August 1, 1913. Sapulpa was ruled the winner. The county courthouse was completed in 1914, replacing an earlier structure built in 1902.


=== Economic development ===
The area around Sapulpa mainly produced walnuts when the town was founded. In 1898, the Sapulpa Pressed Brick was established, followed in a few years by the Sapulpa Brick Company. This began the clay products industry. Sapulpa is still the home of Frankoma Pottery.The founding of Premium Glass Company in 1912 marked Sapulpa's entry to glass manufacturing. Premium Glass was absorbed into Liberty Glass Company in 1918; the plant, after many changes in facilities and ownership, continues today under Ardagh Group, largely making beer bottles.  Other glass producers in the city were Bartlett-Collins Glass Company, originally opened in 1914, which was closed by subsequent owner Anchor Hocking in 2008; Schram Glass Company, which opened a jar and jar cap plant in 1914 which was closed by the Ball Brothers in 1931; and, The Sunflower Glass Plant, which produced window glass, began operations in 1913; and, after being leased to Victory Window Glass Co. in 1924, ceased operations in 1932. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History, Sapulpa became known as  "The Crystal City of the Southwest".


=== Rail transportation ===
In 1889 the Frisco route between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, passing through Sapulpa, was opened.  The Frisco built a railyard in Sapulpa and by 1900 designated Sapulpa as the location of an overhaul base for its rolling stock.  Also in 1900, construction of the line from Sapulpa to Denison, Texas was started and rushed to completion by March 1901.  
With changes in ownership over the years, the portion of the old Frisco line between Sapulpa and Del City, Oklahoma, near Oklahoma City ended up owned by the State of Oklahoma.  In 1998, the line was leased to Stillwater Central Railroad, and in 2014 was sold to that company.  The sale contract included a requirement to start a six-month daily passenger service trial run before August 2019-- known as the Eastern Flyer-- with a financial penalty for not meeting the deadline set at $2.8 million.  On August 5, 2019, the Stillwater Central opted to default under the contract and pay the $2.8 million penalty for not establishing the service.Separately, Sapulpa in the early days was on the route of the Sapulpa & Interurban Railway (“S&I”) streetcar/interurban line connecting to Tulsa in one direction, and Kiefer, Glenpool, and Mounds in the other.  S&I subsequently went through a series of mergers and name changes, with only the Tulsa-to-Sapulpa portion continuing as the Tulsa-Sapulpa Union Railway.


=== Route 66 ===
Sapulpa is along old U.S. Route 66, now SH-66 and Historic Route 66 (a/k/a the West Ozark Trail) through town.  Route 66 sites include the Heart of Route 66 Auto Museum which opened in August 2016 in an Armory built in 1948.  This features the world's tallest replica of an antique visible gas pump, being 66 feet in height.  Also still present is the Rock Creek Bridge, a/k/a the historic Bridge #18 at Rock Creek, a notable 1921 metal bridge that became a link in the original Route 66 in 1926.
