== History ==
After previous attempts in 1565 and 1592, the current city was founded as San Salvador de Velazco en el Valle de Jujuy on April 19, 1593, by Francisco de Argañarás y Murguía. The settlement initially developed as a strategic site on the mule trade route between San Miguel de Tucumán and the silver mines in Potosí, Bolivia.
Reaching its peak importance during the colonial period, San Salvador de Jujuy declined to the status of a remote provincial capital after the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816. The town became the capital of Jujuy Province when the latter separated from Salta Province in 1834. The 1863 Jujuy earthquake leveled the town, and it recovered slowly in the following decades. Jujuy began to grow following the arrival of the Northern Central Railway in 1900. Its first institution of higher learning, the Economic Sciences Institute, was established in 1959, and was incorporated into the new National University of Jujuy in 1973. The city was the location of a number of Argentine films, including Veronico Cruz (1988) and Una estrella y dos cafés (2005). The city's impoverished Lower Azopardo neighborhood would later give rise to Milagro Sala's Indigenist Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Association.


== Climate ==
Jujuy has a humid subtropical climate (Cwa, according to the Köppen climate classification), mainly because of the altitude. Summers bring warm days at 28 °C (82 °F) and nights at 16 °C (61 °F) with frequent thunderstorms. The rest of the year is sunny, with temperatures at about 24 °C (75 °F) during the day and 11 °C (52 °F) at night, crisp, dry winters with warm days of 19 °C (66 °F) and cold nights at 6 °C (39 °F), and sunny springs with warm days (26 °C, or 79 °F) and cool nights (11 °C, 52 °F). During heat waves, temperatures can sometimes reach 35 °C (95 °F) but these are not frequent and nights always bring significant cooling, as opposed to many low-lying areas in Northern Argentina. During the winter, temperatures can reach −7 °C (19 °F) and snow, although rare, may fall on occasion. Precipitation is about 800 mm, which falls in the form of thunderstorms during the warmest months. The highest temperature recorded was 42.4 °C (108 °F) on October 16, 2014 while the lowest temperature recorded was −6.9 °C (20 °F) on August 14, 1978.
