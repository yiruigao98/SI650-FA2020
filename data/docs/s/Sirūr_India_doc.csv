== History ==

The idea of AIIMS arose in 1946, after a recommendation by the Health survey of the government of India. From then to the establishment and development of AIIMS (New Delhi) over the ensuing years, several illustrious individuals played their part in bringing the idea to fruition. Originally proposed by the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru for establishment in Calcutta, it was established in New Delhi following the refusal of Chief Minister of West Bengal Bidhan Chandra Roy. The foundation stone of AIIMS Delhi was laid in 1952. On February 18, 1956, the then Minister of Health, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, introduced a new bill in the Lok Sabha, that would eventually become the AIIMS Act. “It has been one of my cherished dreams that for post graduate study and for the maintenance of high standards of medical education in our country, we should have an institute of this nature which would enable our young men and women to have their post graduate education in their own country,” she said. The old and new main OPD blocks at AIIMS, New Delhi are named after her. When the bill was adopted in May 1956, it became the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Act, 1956.

=== AIIMS (New Delhi) Campus Redevelopment Master plan 2019 ===
In February 2019 The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister of India has given 'in principle' approval to the Implementation of Master Plan to convert All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi into a world class Medical University.The visualization at the time of institute's construction (in 1950s) was for a limited number of patients. The medical institute was established as a tertiary-care centre, but now it has turned into a primary care centre. Over time, the requirement has increased manifold. The upcoming master plan will now have a vision for the next decade.

The Master Plan envisages freeing up adequate space through redevelopment, vertical expansion and reorganizing the land usage, thus optimizing the infrastructure of the Institute for the next 20 years.
It is proposed to re-develop the infrastructure of AIIMS, New Delhi by consolidating the Patient Care, Teaching, Research, Administration and support services in areas in the East Ansari Nagar (Main) Campus and residential facilities from East Ansari Nagar (Main Campus) to Trauma Centre Extension (New Rajnagar) Campus.Benefits:
The project would provide highly specialized state-of-the-art healthcare to the patients and an integrated 'One Campus' answer to all the investigative, physiotherapeutic, operative, rehabilitative and vocational needs of the patients. It would ensure smart mobility and accessibility for the patients and become an apex tertiary care centre for advancement of research, clinical applications and management of patients.


==== Works expected as per the Redevelopment Master plan ====
By 2024, AIIMS (New Delhi) will add around 3,000 more beds to its existing strength of 2,478 beds. So there will be a facility of approximately 5,500 beds in service by then.A move that will come as a relief for thousands of patients who visit the hospital every day as presently the hospital sees a daily footfall of almost 15,000 patients and their attendants. It also aims to strengthen patient-care services and residential facilities for faculty members and staff.
Officials said the estimated cost of executing the master plan is around ₹10,345 crore, including ₹1,000 crore for hiring manpower .
The project will be completed in two phases; while Phase 1 will be completed in 46 months, the second phase will be finalized in 70 months.
As per the plan, a convention centre, a guesthouse with 40 rooms, a hostel with more than 4,500 rooms and 500 residential units with allied car parking will be set up.
As There is no scope of further expansion with the limited availability of land, residential facilities stretching from Trauma Centre campus, West Campus (Ansari Nagar) to East Campus (Ansari Nagar) and Ayurvigyan Nagar Campus will be relocated. This will free up space in the main campus and allow to expand vertically.With senior faculty members raising issues of shortage of labs and operation theaters in the institute, the administration hopes the upcoming project will look into that concern. This new plan will also create scope for research projects, which have been pending due to space constraints.

== Controversies ==


=== AIIMS (Delhi) Scam whistle-blower case ===
On 29 June 2012, IFoS officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi was made Deputy Secretary of AIIMS (New Delhi). He was also given the charge of Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) at AIIMS. As the CVO, Chaturvedi took action in a large number of corruption cases involving:Selling of counterfeit medicines at a private on-campus pharmacy owned by an MLA
Corruption in recruitment
Purchase of medical equipments & consumables
Financial irregularities in ₹3850 crore construction projects and tenure extension of then Head of Engineering-Wing supervising these projects
Unauthorized foreign trips by doctors
Single bid tendering
Corruption in computerization purchases
Treatment of officers' pet dog at institute
Matters of subletting
Pension fund scam
Sexual harassment
Serious violations by security contractor firmsChaturvedi initiated actions in around 200 corruption cases during his stint as AIIMS CVO; punishment was imposed in 78 cases, chargesheet was issued in 87 cases and more than 20 cases were referred to CBI for criminal investigation. These cases included the ones against senior IAS officer Vineet Chawdhry, of Himachal Pradesh cadre, who had worked earlier as Deputy. Director (Administration), former Deputy Director (Administration) Shailesh Yadav, a senior IPS officer, many senior faculty members, former Registrar V.P. Gupta and former Chief Administrative Officer Attar Singh.


==== CBI inquiries and further results in this case ====
Subsequently, on many investigations done by Chaturvedi, CBI registered cases and recommended action against Vineet Chawdhry. As per India Today investigative report of June 2017, J P Nadda, Union Health Minister was found to have hushed up investigation into what the report termed as 7000 crore scam, detailing CBI report and scathing reports of Parliamentary Committee. Opposition parties on basis of this investigative report and documents mentioned in the report, accused Nadda of links with senior IAS officer Vineet Chawdhry who had earlier worked with Nadda in Himachal Pradesh
Earlier in September 2013, CBI had registered a criminal case on basis of enquiry done by Vigilance Cell of AIIMS, regarding large scale fake payments made in security wing of AIIMS and financial irregularities into security contract award to a private company.
In October 2015, CBI, on basis of enquiry done by Chaturvedi, found then AIIMS Director, Dr. M C Mishra, and certain other AIIMS officials including store officer guilty of involvement in corruption in purchase of medical items including disinfectants in trauma centre, on basis of wrong propriety certificate and recommended action against them to Health Ministry, as deemed fit.
Again, in January 2018 CBI registered criminal case under sections of forgery and Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 against certain AIIMS officials for corruption in purchase in Surgery Department, to favour particular firms, on basis of enquiry report sent by Chaturvedi as CVO to CBI in May 2014.
However, it was found later on that all the major corruption cases exposed and being investigated by CVO Chaturvedi, involving senior IAS, IPS officers, AIIMS Director and senior AIIMS officials were being hushed up after Chaturvedi's removal and taking over of Health Ministry by J P Nadda.
In August 2014, Chaturvedi was relieved from the charge of CVO.
On 16 August, he wrote a letter to the new health minister Harsh Vardhan, alleging that his removal from the CVO post was a result of campaign by corrupt officials. He was supported by AIIMS staff, who wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking for his reinstatement. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held protests in his support


=== Institutional preference seats matter ===
Around year 2002 AIIMS decision to reserving 33% of post-graduation seats as Institutional preference seats for its own undergraduate MBBS students, resulted in a controversy as it practically resulted in a 100% reservation for subjects, was struck down by the Supreme Court of India. In 2006 Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss, who was a supporter of 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes, caused a controversy when he replaced P. Venugopal with T. D. Dogra as Director of AIIMS (New Delhi). The initial personality conflict between Ramadoss and Venugopal later become politicised as a conflict on reservation issue, as anti-reservation students and faculty of AIIMS (New Delhi) went on strike in favor of Venugopal. The issue was put to rest when Venugopal was reinstated by the Supreme Court.
