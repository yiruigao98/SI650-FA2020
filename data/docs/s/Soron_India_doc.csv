The Noron (Korean: 노론; Hanja: 老論; RR: noron) were a political faction of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea. They consisted of the supporters of Song Siyeol after the split of the Westerners. The Noron suffered setbacks with Kim Seok-ju's death in 1684 and Song's execution in 1689. In 1701, Queen Inhyeon, who favored the Noron, died. They were favored by King Yeongjo, who came to the throne in 1724.
