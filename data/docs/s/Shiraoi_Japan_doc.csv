Shiraoi (白老町, Shiraoi-chō) is a town located in Iburi, Hokkaido, Japan. As of September 2016, the town had a population of 17,759. It was established in 1867 by the feudal lords of Sendai. Most of the area of the town is forested and parts lie within the Shikotsu-Tōya National Park.


== History ==
Shiraoi, like the rest of Hokkaido, was populated by the Ainu. According to the town's official website, the name, Shiraoi, means Rainbows in the Ainu language. Other sources state that the name comes from Shiraunai meaning Horse-flies.In 1867, the Sendai domain established a fort in Shiraoi and work began on Shiogama Shrine (塩釜神社, Shiogama Jinja). The following year the Boshin War caused Sendai to retreat from Shiraoi and return to Sendai proper. After the revolt was put down the government dismantled the fort in 1870.
The end of the 19th century saw expansion of the town. A road was established connecting Shiraoi with Muroran, Sapporo, and Hakodate in 1873. Nineteen years later, the first railroad station was established. The villages of Shadai and Shikiu were established. Two significant events occurred during this expansion: in 1874, Mount Tarumae erupted, and in 1881, the Emperor Meiji visited.
