Sant Martí (Catalan pronunciation: [ˈsam məɾˈti]), is a district of Barcelona located on its eastern side, usually numbered 10 out of the ten districts of the city.
It borders the Mediterranean Sea, Sant Adrià del Besòs and four other districts of the city: Ciutat Vella, l'Eixample, Horta-Guinardó and Sant Andreu.
It did not become an integral part of Barcelona until as late as 1897, having been an autonomous village since 1714 with the imposition of the infamous Nueva Planta decrees. Before then, it had been a secondary parish of Santa Maria del Mar.
