Sokcho (Korean: 속초; (Korean pronunciation: [sok̚.tɕʰo])) is a city in Gangwon-do province, South Korea. It is located in the far northeast of Gangwon-do. The city is a major tourist hub, and a popular gateway to nearby Seoraksan national park. Sokcho is home to the few lakes: Yeongrangho and Cheongchoho that are naturally created by the Sea of Japan.


== History ==
Sokcho originally was a part of Dongye from roughly 3rd-century BC to around early 5th-century. Sokcho started from just a fishing village with a few people around Cheongchoho. In 1905, it became one of the major ports because of its geological feature. Since Cheongchoho lake is adjacent to the Sea of Japan, big ships were able to come in and out with ease. Later on, Sokcho, linked with Seoul by air and road, the city became a mineral transfer port in 1937. Upon the division of the Korean peninsula into two countries following World War II, Sokcho was on the North Korean side of the border, but since the Korean War armistice (1953), it has been a part of South Korea.

Sockho's traditional market is full of things to see, buy, and eat. Formed in 1953 as the Sokcho Tourist & Fishery Market, it was included on the Korea Tourism Organization's list of “Best Traditional Markets for Foreign Tourists” last year. From fresh fish caught off the coast in the Sea of Japan to dried fish and various vegetables, one can find fun in just looking around and watching the fishmongers bargaining with local market goers.Sokcho is known for Hoe, which is a raw fish. The coastal waters provide good fishing grounds for Ojingeo, Myeongtae, Gwangeo and Godeungeo.Sundubu can be found in the streets of the tofu towns such as Sinheung Sundubu and Haksapyeong Sundubu - it is made from Seoraksan and Sea of Japan water.
