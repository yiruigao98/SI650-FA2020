Seto is located in the hilly northern region of Aichi Prefecture, bordering Gifu Prefecture, approximately  35 minutes from Nagoya by way of the Meitetsu Seto Line. In English, the name of "Seto" translates to "the place where the river runs quickly." However, while there is a river in Seto, it is neither significantly large nor quick-moving. The city of Seto is famous for its pottery and ceramics, so much so that the generic word for ceramics in Japanese is setomono (瀬戸物). The main street along the river is lined with dozens of pottery shops. Every third Saturday and Sunday in September, there is a very large pottery festival called Setomono Matsuri (瀬戸物祭り) This festival attracts about 20,000 visitors from around Japan and abroad every year.
