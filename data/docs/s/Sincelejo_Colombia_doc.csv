== History ==
The land comprising Sincelejo was inhabited in the Prehispanic age by several groups of indigenous people known as the Zenú.Sincelejo was founded on October 4, 1535, the feast day of Francis of Assisi, with the name San Francisco de Asís de Sincelejo. The village used to be a part of Alonso Padilla's encomienda between 1610 and 1640, and was located on the site of a small Zenú indigenous settlement. At that time the indigenous people were overpowered and exploited by the Spanish colonizers, or encomenderos.On November 21, 1775, Sincelejo was re-founded by the Spanish captain and engineer, Antonio de la Torre y Miranda, following orders from Cartagena's governor, Juan de Torrezar Díaz Pimienta. The construction of the town began with a church, the lands around it given to people who used to live sporadically across the region; this was to consolidate a religious and political center in the zone. Sincelejo was intended to follow the classical Spanish colonial grid, with the main church and its square in the center of the town, but this was not possible because of several creeks that ran through the town.In 1812, Sincelejo became shelter for the revolutionary priests in La Rebelión de los Curas (the Priests' Insurrection).
By 1887, Sincelejo was one of the leading towns in the Province of Cartagena. In 1908 it became the short-lived capital of the department of Sincelejo, ultimately becoming part of the Province of Cartagena again in 1910. In 1912, Sincelejo almost disappeared because of a massive conflagration which destroyed most of the central zone; nevertheless the town was rebuilt. With the creation of the Sucre Department in 1966, Sincelejo subsequently became the capital.
On January 20, 1980, the Corralejas Stadium collapsed, killing at least 200 people.

== Corraleja ==

Sincelejo is best known for its yearly folkloric and religious party - the 20th of January Party Fiestas del dulce nombre de Jesús (The party of the sweet name of Jesus) also known as Jesus' Sweet Name Party. This party includes a structure known as Corraleja, which is a temporary crafty wooden bullring, where the main attraction is watching the bullfighters facing the bulls. There is no official remuneration for the bullfighters who dare to enter the ring, but usually the wealthiest landowners state an unofficial monetary incentive for those who stab the bull using small prickers. The picadors are also a part of the show, but they belong to cattle raising farms and they're paid for their work, but the unofficial incentive also applies for them.
The construction of the temporary bullring starts at the end of December, and civil engineers and architects supervise the work of dozens of workers. The bullfighting takes places in four or five journeys (a journey a day), usually including the weekend. Different cattle rising farms (previously chosen) are in charge of supplying the bulls - about 40 bulls per day - so at the end of the last day the most entertaining journey is chosen, with people's participation, and the cattle rising farm is awarded with an official incentive. A ticket to watch a bullfighting journey costs about 15-35 US Dollars and usually the last journey is the most expensive.
The main criticisms of the corraleja is the treatment of the animals, not only in the bullfighting but as it is being prepared, the safety of the usually unskilled bullfighters, and the consumption of alcohol within the bullring by watchers and bullfighters. Anyone who dares to join the bullfighters must have insurance, which is sold on site, so if they are hurt their medical costs are covered.
