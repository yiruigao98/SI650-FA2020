== History ==

The history of Sloviansk dates back to the beginning of the 16th century when the first settlements formed by Ukrainian peasants appeared on its territory. Later on in 1645 was founded a border fortress against the Crimean attacks and slave raids on the southern suburbs of modern Ukraine and  Russia.
In 1664 the first salt plant for the extraction of salt was built that caused the appearance of housing for workers. In 1676, a fortress named Tor was built at the confluence of the Kazenyy Torets and Sukhyy Torets Rivers where they form the Torets River, a tributary of Donets River. Shortly thereafter, the town of Tor grew up next to the fortress.As several salt lakes were located close by, the town became a producer of salt. During the sixteenth century, salt production was the principal local industry, but during the eighteenth century, it became unprofitable and ceased on December 21, 1782.
In 1784, the city was renamed Sloviansk, and it became a part of the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire in 1797. A resort was established on the shores of Lake Ropne in 1832.
In April 1918 troops loyal to the Ukrainian People's Republic took control of Sloviansk.The city was occupied by the Germans on October 28, 1941. In December 1941, SS Einsatzkommando 4b executed more than a thousand Jews who lived in the city. The Red Army temporarily expelled the Nazi occupiers on February 17, 1943. Germans retook it on 1 March 1943. Finally the Red Army retook it on 6 September 1943.

Ukraine's outgoing President Olexander Turchynov described the downing as a "terrorist attack," and blamed pro-Russian militants.The city was held by Russia-backed separatists until July 5, 2014; when pressed by the Ukrainian army they had to retreat from Sloviansk and pull back to Donetsk city.In 2015 a plaque to the memory of Volodymyr Rybak was placed in the town center.
