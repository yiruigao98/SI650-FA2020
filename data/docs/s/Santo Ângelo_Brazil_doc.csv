== History ==
Santo Ângelo was founded on August 12, 1706 by the Belgium Jesuit Diego de Haze. The original name of Santo Ângelo was "Santo Ángel Custodio" (in Spanish) and then "Santo Ângelo Custódio."  The Reduction of Santo Ângelo was dedicated to "Anjo Custódio das Missões", the guard and protector of the missionaries or Jesuits.
The Angelopolitana Cathedral in Santo Ângelo, Rio Grande do Sul, was built in the 1920s on the same spot as the Santo Ângelo reduction built by Jesuits and the Guarani in the 18th century—the Cathedral is modeled after the ancient São Miguel das Missões mission also known as São Miguel Arcanjo.
