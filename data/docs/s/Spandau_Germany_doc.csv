Spandau (pronounced [ˈʃpandaʊ̯]) is the westernmost of the twelve boroughs (Bezirke) of Berlin, situated at the confluence of the Havel and Spree rivers and extending along the western bank of Havel. It is the smallest borough by population, but the fourth largest by land area.


== Overview ==
Modern industries in Spandau include metalworking, and chemical and electrical factories. BMW Motorrad's Spandau factory made all BMW's motorcycles from 1969 until final assembly plants were added in Rayong, Thailand in 2000, and Manaus, Brazil in 2016.Rathaus Spandau, Spandau's seat of government, was built in 1913. Other landmarks include the Renaissance fortress Spandau Citadel, built in 1594, the 1848 St. Marien am Behnitz Catholic church designed by August Soller, and Spandau arsenal, Germany's arms development center until 1919, now a museum. That arsenal's Spandau machine gun inspired the slang Spandau Ballet to describe dying soldiers on barbed wire during the First World War, and later was applied to the appearance of Nazi war criminals hanged at Spandau Prison. The notorious prison, built in 1876, held Nazi war criminals after World War II until 1987, when it was demolished after the death of the last surviving prisoner, Rudolf Hess. In 1979, the English New Romantic band Spandau Ballet again re-purposed the term for its name.
After World War II Spandau fell into the British and American sector of West Berlin during the Allied occupation. Gatow airfield in the south of the district, was used by the Royal Air Force, most notably during the Berlin Airlift. Since 1995 the airfield is now the Museum of Military History.
