San Antonio, officially the Municipality of San Antonio (Tagalog: Bayan ng San Antonio), is a 1st class municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 77,836 people.


== History ==
The present name of the town was given in 1843 in honor of the patron saint, San Antonio Abad, by Father Leocadio Luis, the first priest of the town. Before its organization and recognition as a town by means of a decree promulgated during the Spanish regime, this was a barangay of Gapan and was known as Barrio Delinquente.
San Antonio was previously called as the barrio of Delinquente as old residents claimed that the name Delinquente originated by the sinking of a Casco (big boat / banca) fully loaded with palay in Pampanga River.
It was partitioned from the town of Gapan in 1843 by the order of Governor-General Marcelino Oraa, along with the town of San Isidro. The movement of the separation of Barrio Delinquente from the town of Gapan, and its organization as an independent municipality was ignited in 1839. The petition of the residents of Barrio Delinquente was finally approved in November 1842 but the definite separation from the town of Gapan took place in 1843.
It is bounded by the towns of Jaen to its eastern side, Zaragosa is to the north, Cabiao and San Isidro, and Concepcion in the Province of Tarlac is at its western border. From Manila the popular route going to San Antonio is via the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), exiting at San Simon and head on to Jose Abad Santos Avenue turning right towards Arayat, Pampanga. Reaching the town of San Isidro, turn left to the road leading to San Antonio. The other route is to exit the NLEX at Santa Rita and traverse the Pan-Philippine Highway across the length of the Province of Bulacan up to Gapan City in Nueva Ecija and turning left on the Gapan-Olongapo Road.
