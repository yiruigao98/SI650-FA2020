== History ==
The region received its first settlers in 1952 with the arrival of José Pereira do Nascimento, Lozorik Belem, and Ovídio Martins de Souza who bought large areas of land and began to raise cattle. José Pereira do Nascimento was a Spiritualist healer and attracted people seeking a cure for their ills. Soon a small settlement began to grow on the banks of the São Miguel River, called São Miguel.  Soon the government surveyed the land and demarcated lots for distribution to new farmers coming from the south of the state of Minas Gerais. In 1958 it passed directly from district to municipality with its present name.  The greatest period of growth was in the 1960s when thousands of settlers arrived from the south of the country receiving free land to settle in the region.
