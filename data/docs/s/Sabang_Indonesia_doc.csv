==== India-Indonesia port development ====
 
Sabang has an ancient port on the historic Maritime Silk Route. To enhance cooperation in the national and maritime security and safety, trade connectivity, infrastructure and ecobomic development, the strategic partners India and Indonesia are jointly developing the Sabang deepsea port which also lies close to the India's southernmost territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In 2002, Indian Navy and Indonesian Navy signed "Ind-Indo Corpat" agreement. In May 2018, "Shared Vision of Maritime Cooperation in the Indo Pacific" agreement was signed between these two nations when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Indonesia. Consequently, both navies have been hosting bilateral "Samudra Shakti" naval exercise since November 2018 including in Java Sea and Andaman Sea. Indian naval ships have been regularly visiting Sabang port after the signing of the agreement. Several Indian navy ships undertook naval exercises and visits to Sabang e.g. a destroyer INS Rana in 2002, INS Sumitra in July 2018, INS VIJIT in 2019.Indonesia's minister for maritime affairs, Luhut Pandjaitan, stated that Indonesia has given economic and military access to India to strategic Sabang port which will invest in the port and economic zone of Sabang and build a hospital. He further stated that both India and Indonesia are large nations which do not need to lean towards any superpower, and that Indian navy ships will have access to the port which has 40 meter depth which is good for all vessels including submarines. Both nations started to discuss the Sabang port project in 2014. Shipping lanes passing through here are the global Choke point, Indonesia has “global maritime fulcrum” to counter balance the China's BRI, and this new India-Indonesia strategic partnership will balance the power in IOR and address the shared India-Indonesia's concerns about China's assertiveness in this region. Port is a key element of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.
