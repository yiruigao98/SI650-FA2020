== History ==
Before the year 1900, there was a battalion of soldiers of the then princely state of Bikaner to protect the north eastern boundary on the site of the present Sangaria town, which was then known as ‘Sangar’, and this is the origin of the town's name. In 1901-02 the Bikaner state railway line was extended from Hanumangarh to Bhatinda. At that time there were few people living close by so the railway station was called ‘Chautala Road’ after the name of the village Chautala situated in Haryana at a distance of 6 km (4 mi) from here. From that time onward people settled in the area. The State Government sanctioned an agricultural mandi here during the early twentieth century. The area was barren and there was no drinking water supply so water was transported by railway from Hanumangarh town and then supplied to each house.
Ancient history reveals that this area was part of the nearly 5000 years old Indus Valley Civilization. The remains of human skeletons, unknown scripts, stamps, coins, utensils, jewellery, toys, statues, wells, bathrooms, forts, streets and markets found in the course of excavations tell the story of the well developed life style of the people of the region.
In early days Sangariya was popular for its Gangaur mela (fair) for the sale and purchase of animals such as camels, oxen, cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep, donkeys and horses.
It was also well known at one time for its herds of billy goats, hence Sangaria was called Bokawali (a village of billy goats) or Boak Mandi (a place to sell and buy billy goats)

Swami Keshwanand was made director of Jat School Sangaria in 1932 when the school was about to close for want of funds. He went from village to village and to the sethi of the desert region who were in Calcutta and far off places and collected funds. He became instrumental in starting hundreds of schools in the desert region. The Jat School Sangaria was renamed as Gramothan Vidyapith, Sangaria in 1948.
