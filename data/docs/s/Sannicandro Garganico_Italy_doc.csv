San Nicandro Garganico (Pugliese: Sànde Lecàndre) known until 1999 as Sannicandro Garganico) is a town and comune in the province of Foggia in the Apulia region of southeast Italy.
The comune is bordered by those of Apricena, Cagnano Varano, Lesina, Poggio Imperiale and San Marco in Lamis.
In 1945, about 30 Italian members of a tiny Sabbatarian sect converted to Judaism. Most of the gerim emigrated to Israel and reside mainly in the cities of Birya and Safed, although some remain in San Nicandro Garganico today.
