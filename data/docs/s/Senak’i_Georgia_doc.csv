The Kutais Governorate (Russian: Кутаисская губерния; Georgian: ქუთაისის გუბერნია) was one of the guberniyas of the Caucasus Viceroyalty of the Russian Empire. It roughly corresponded to most of western Georgia and most of Artvin Province (except Hopa and Yusufeli districts) of Turkey between 1878 and 1917. It was created out of part of the former Georgia-Imeretia Governorate in 1846. It also included Akhaltsikhe uyezd before its cession to the Tiflis Governorate in 1867.
