== History ==
The first inhabitants were the Negritos and "hacheros" (woodcutters) under Don Juli치n Astigarraga (Capitan Vasco 1854-1901) of Aparri. Some fishermen from Minanga ( a barrio of Gonzaga) came and settled in Palawig. In 1891, Felipe Agarpao with some settlers organized a "gimong" (society) called "Inanama." The purpose of the organisation was to acquire and occupy lands around the place. That same year, Briccio Campa침ano of Lapog, Ilocos Sur together with some others from Ilocos came to Palawig to apply for homesteads in the sitio of Marede. These settlers organized another "gimong" called "Dagupan."
In 1900, the woodcutters from Aparri led by Don Julian Astigarraga arrived by the first boat. Thus, began the clearing of settlements.
From 1919 to 1935 several group of settlers from the Ilocos Region came to claim lands aboard virays (light seagoing boats). The once-forested areas were accessible only via rivers and the sea. Before reaching the settlements in the northern and eastern portions, they had to navigate through Palawig River.
The name Palawig was coined from the local term pasawig, meaning mouth of the river.
In 1935, the gimongs "Inanama and Dagupan" fused into one called "Da Inanama," headed by Navarro, they began to work for the separation of Palawig as a municipality independent from Gonzaga. Their application was held in abeyance because their population did not meet the needed number required by law. The move was suspended in 1941 and when  World War II broke out the move was not carried out.
Barrio Palawig and its neighbouring barrios were separated from Gonzaga and the town was created by President Elpidio Quirino via Executive Order No. 289 (21 October 1949). Contrary to the usual assumption, it is not named for Saint Anne but is an acronym of the surnames of the then-three provincial officials: Governor Nicasio Arranz; and Provincial Board members Federico Navarro; and Roberto Avena. The association to the saint was a back-formation in keeping with traditional Hispanicised toponyms.

== Festivities ==
Every May 26 to May 30 of the year, the town plays host to the Viray Festival, organized by the local government with the support of the regional tourism office and the private sector. Launched in June 2005, the Viray Festival was conceptualized to dramatize the significance of the viray, which played a key role in the lives and history of the town.
A viray is a large wooden flat boat which, before the use of gasoline-fed engines in the early 1950s, was propelled by sails. Comerciantes (traders) used large virays measuring 18 metres (59 ft) long, 5 metres (16 ft) wide and 3.5 metres (11 ft) high. Fishermen, on the other hand, used smaller ones, usually 11 metres (36 ft) long, 5 metres (16 ft) wide and 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high. Equipped with oars to reach nearby fishing grounds, these types sailed for longer distances.
Due to its capacity to carry great quantities of cargo, viray was the only means of transport used by the first settlers of Santa Ana.
Leaders and well-off families derived income from the services of the viray ranging from fishing operation, commerce and trade to means of transport during the years when Santa Ana was at its prime. Used for daklis (trawl net), sapiao (net) and sirut (ring net) fishing, viray could carry the fishing gears, provisions, supplies, and manpower. It is assisted by small bancas during the fishing operation.
An annual fluvial parade of colorful boats is held during the first day.
The second day of the festival features a grand carabao parade where each of the 16 barangays composing the municipality has their turn to show off their artistic talents.
On the third day, local folks and visitors alike line up along the main street to watch colorful bodies participating in the street dancing competition.
