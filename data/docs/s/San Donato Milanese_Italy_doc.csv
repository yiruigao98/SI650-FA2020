== History ==
Although the area was settled in ancient times, the origins of San Donato date back to the 7th century, when a pieve was founded here by the army of Grimoald I, Duke of Benevento. After a period under the Milanese family De Advocati, the town was a possession of the archbishops of Milan until the 16th century.
A series of abbeys were founded in the area by Bernard of Clairvaux during the 11th century. Later Frederick Barbarossa resided here after his destruction of Milan, while the Visconti and the Torriani fought here (1278) for the possession of the duchy of Milan. The battle of Marignano was also fought nearby, Francis I of France settled his headquarters here after the battle.
Today San Donato is a modern industrial and services centre. It received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on the 30th of December 1976.
