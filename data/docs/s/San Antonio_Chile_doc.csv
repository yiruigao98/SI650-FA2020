== Tourism ==
The zone will give way to a tourist route that will have cuisine, with the emerging cuisine being based on shellfish and oenology. This initiative is supported by a program called The Seaboard Program of the Poets supported by CORFO, or in Spanish "el programa litoral de los Poetas de la CORFO." The new route explains that it will unite the circuit to the local productions, chefs and wine vineyards, like the vineyards of Matetic, Casa Marín, Amayna, Lo Abarca, and Malvilla. Also, with the support from the Program of Tourism and Interests by CORFO, in the last year, wine growers, food industries, and tourism have initiated a process of trainings and associations under the concept of a good cuisine being the local identity.
