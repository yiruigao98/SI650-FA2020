Sieradz [ˈɕerat͡s] (listen) (Latin: Syradia, German: 1941-45 Schieratz) is  a town on the Warta river in central Poland with 42,762 inhabitants (2016). It is situated in the Łódź Voivodeship (since 1999), but was previously the eponymous capital of the Sieradz Voivodeship (1975–1998), and historically one of the minor duchies in Greater Poland.
It is one of the oldest towns in Poland, thrice being a location for the coronation of the Polish monarchs. The town was attacked by the Tartars, Bohemians and Teutonic Knights. Polish Kings chaired six assemblies from here.


== History ==
The oldest settlements can be traced back to almost 6th century. Centuries later, king Casimir the Great built the Castle of Sieradz.
In the mid 13th century it was conferred with Municipal rights.  It had also welcomed many settlers from Scotland & Netherlands after the 13th century. During the fragmentation of Poland, it was the site of the Duchy of Sieradz.
In 1445 the election of King Casimir IV Jagiellon took place at this town. Until the 16th century the town used to be important trade centre. Merchants from Spain & Portugal were frequently visiting the town for Trade and commerce. In the 17th century due to the Swedish wars, plagues, fires and floods the town lost its trading importance and fell from its prime. In the 18th century the reconstruction of town commenced. The residents during that time were only approximately 1500.


=== Nineteenth and twentieth centuries ===
On 13 November 1806 an uprising against the Prussians took place in Sieradz. It was the capital of a district within the Kalisz Governorate of the Russian Empire until the establishment of the Polish Second Republic in 1918.With the invasion of Poland and the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sieradz was attacked on September 9 and occupied by the Wehrmacht. Annexed by Nazi Germany, it was renamed Schieratz and administered as part of the county or district (kreis) of the same name within Reichsgau Wartheland.
The Nazis destroyed traces of Polish culture, destroying historical records, monuments, and buildings. Street names were changed in an effort to wipe out any connection with a Polish identity. Bombed by the Soviets, more than 100 residents were killed. After an assault lasting three days, the Red Army arrived on January 23, 1945.
Following the war, it became part of the People's Republic of Poland. Economic activities included clothing manufacture, cereal-milling, spirit distillery, potato farming and other agricultural activities. In 1957 the knitting plant "Sira" was founded.
