== History ==
Suratgarh was a significant arena of historical incidences in the ancient past. The city was once called Sodal. Around 3000 BC Suratgarh is believed to have been a lush, green place due to the presence of two big rivers, Sarasvati and Drishadvati. Present sand possessed various botanical and zoological species within the basins of chaste Sarasvati and Drishvati. The emergence of Kalibangan and Barod civilizations were facilitated by the geographical and environmental complements of the Sarasvati, and Suratgarh was a noteworthy testimony of this. The traces of ancient civilization near Rangmahal, Manaksaar and Amarpura show the historical significance of Suratgarh where Sarasvati civilization has receded after 1500 years of stability.
Suratgarh developed greatly under the rule of Maharaja Ganga Singh who built a hunting lodge at Suratgarh and ensured the connectivity of Suratgarh to train service. Hanumangarh and Bikaner came under the Suratgarh District when the district was established. Establishment of the Ganges canal in 1927 helped Suratgarh develop; it became a city after partition when various refugees from Pakistan came in and started settling there. Suratgarh Central State Farm was established in 1956, followed with the establishment of the Indira Gandhi Canal project and Central Animal Reproduction Farm in the 1960s. Meanwhile, an air and military base station, Akashvani and various offices had been established. Suratgarh Thermal Power Station started working from 3 November 1998 and this laid down one more milestone in the progress of Suratgarh city.
It has a thermal power plant of 1500 MW and a PLF of 93%, which has won an award for one of the best-operated plants in India. The industry experienced acute growth with the construction of the thermal power plant and its residential buildings. Since then the industry has been growing quickly. With the reducing demands as a result of completion of the thermal power plant project, bricks from Suratgarh are now supplied to various parts of Rajasthan especially to the districts of Churu and Jhunjhunu.
