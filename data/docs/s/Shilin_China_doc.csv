Shilin District (also spelled Shihlin District, Chinese: 士林區; pinyin: shì línqū; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Sṳ-lìm-khî) is a district of Taipei. It is home to a large foreign population, mainly concentrated in the Tianmu area. It has long been a top choice for expatriates from Europe, US, Canada, Southeast Asia and Japan to live, run businesses, and establish embassies and offices due mainly to the natural environment—sitting at the foot of Yangmingshan—and because the international schools are all located here. The central command of the Republic of China Navy is located in Shilin.


== History ==
The name Shilin was derived from Pattsiran, the Ketagalan word for "hot springs". It was then transliterated into Chinese as "八芝蘭" (pinyin: Bāzhīlán; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pat-chi-lân), which has been written as Pat-chi-na or Pachina.Prior to Han settlement, the area was home to the Kimassauw community (麻少翁社) of the Taiwanese Plains Aborigines. During the Qing era, a fort was set up, later called Zhilan Yi Bao (first fort/settlement of Pattsiran, 芝蘭一堡). By the late Qing dynasty, "many literary talents from Shilin had passed the imperial examination", prompting the local gentry to rename it Shilin (士林), meaning "congregation of scholars and talents".In 1920 under Japanese rule, the area was organized as Shirin Village (士林莊) and in 1933 Shirin Town (士林街), under Shichisei District (七星郡), Taihoku Prefecture. In 1945 after World War II, it was modified to Shilin Township (士林鎭), Taipei County (臺北縣).
Shilin is foremost a residential district and has several famous neighborhoods, such as Waishuangxi (外雙溪) and Tianmu. Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek lived in Shilin after moving the Chinese Nationalist government to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. The district is divided up into 51 villages (里), which are further divided up into 987 neighborhoods (鄰).
The district can be said to be the origin of culture in Taipei. During the Qing Dynasty, many private, public and community schools were opened in the area. During the Japanese era, a national learning center was set up at Zhishanyan.
