This is a list of communities known for possessing a community or a large number (either as a majority or concentration) of Mexican Americans. About 61 percent of Mexican Americans live in just two states, namely California (36%) and Texas (25%). According to the 2010 census, the distribution of Mexican Americans in the United States by region is: 51.8% live in the West, 34.4% in the South, 10.9% in the Midwest, and 2.9% in the Northeast.Mexican Americans are found in all 50 states. The number of Mexican Americans has been increasing dramatically since the late 20th century.
The largest communities by population are located in Los Angeles (esp. East Los Angeles (region), which became a Chicano community since the end of World War II), and unincorporated East Los Angeles (97% Hispanic/Latino - highest in LA county). East L.A. was 65% Mexican-American in the 1970 US census reports, peaked at 85% in 2000, but has dropped to 40% out of 97% Latino in 2015 and according to the US Census in 2015, 88% of Mexicans living in East L.A. are now immigrants. The suburb of Maywood is another largely Mexican and Latino community. Then there's Santa Ana, California (70% out of 80% Latino) in Orange County - esp Barrio Logan (more Central American than Mexican today), San Diego and San Bernardino in Southern California; and San Francisco (the San Francisco Bay Area) including San Jose, California. The state's highest percentage is in Calexico on the Mexican border. Tecate is an unincorporated community on the border is similarly 96% Mexican or Latino. The other 9 largest communities by percentage are found in the California cities of Coachella, Huron, McFarland, Mecca (unincorporated), Mendota, Oasis (unincorporated), Parlier, San Fernando, and Thermal (unincorporated). There are Mexican American majority regions in Central California and Southern California as well in southern Texas and southern Arizona.
The majority of Mexican American persons in northern New Mexico are Hispanos. In Texas, some are Tejanos. Tejano or Texano (Spanish for "Texan") is a term used to identify a Texan of criollo Spanish or Mexican heritage. Some also use Texian, an archaic demonym which defined a resident of Mexican Texas and the Republic of Texas and the same region after annexation by the United States of America in 1845. In addition to Texian, several other names were used during the period, including Texasian, Texilingan, Texican, and Texonian.

Many Mexican-Americans and immigrants alike have settled in other regions of the Central, Midwest (esp. Iowa and Wisconsin), Northeast and Southeast US states. Urban areas of Cincinnati; Cleveland; Fox Cities; Madison, Wisconsin; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Montana; Newark, New Jersey; New York City; Northern New Jersey (developed in the 1990s-2000s); Orange County, New York; Quad Cities; Sioux City, Iowa; South Florida with Miami; Southern New Jersey; and Suffolk County, New York along with Farmingville, New York are notable. And farming areas with often seasonal Mexican migrant labor populations like Buena Vista, Iowa; Cherokee, Iowa; Dubuque, Iowa (depends on economic situation); Eastern Iowa; Fort Dodge, Iowa; Iowa City, Iowa; Kenosha, Wisconsin; Lexington, Nebraska; Northwest Wyoming (esp. the Jackson, Wyoming area); Postville, Iowa; Racine, Wisconsin; Rapid City, South Dakota; Storm Lake, Iowa; and Western Nebraska.
Other areas of equally high Mexican immigration are Akron, Ohio and nearby Canton, Ohio; Atlanta-Northern Georgia (including Dade County, Georgia depending on economic conditions); Baltimore; Billings, Montana; Boise/Snake River Valley; Charlotte, North Carolina Metro area; Columbus-Phenix City; Northwest and western parts of Louisiana; Helena, Montana/Western Montana; Huntsville, Alabama/North Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; Kansas City, Missouri metro area; Kentucky; Louisiana; Milwaukee; Mississippi Gulf Coast; Northern Mississippi (poultry plants); North Carolina; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Providence R.I.; Shenandoah Valley in Virginia (also Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads area); and Tennessee. This is from a wave of Mexican immigration in the 1990s and 2000s.


== Growth of Mexican-Americans ==
According to the 2010 United States Census, there had been a phenomenal growth of Mexican Americans, mostly are immigrants who are Mexican nationals. In the Midwestern United States, places and states such as Michigan (the Detroit metropolitan area); Chicago and its near-in suburbs; Northern Indiana; Southern Wisconsin; Omaha; Kansas City; St. Louis and Minneapolis-St. Paul have developed large Mexican (immigrant and American-born) populations. The states of Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Nebraska attracted Mexican and Latino immigration in the late 20th century (but the trend began to reverse in the 2000s with most of these communities decreased in size when Mexicans returned home) to work in meatpacking plants and agricultural harvests, now many of the states' counties and towns have high growth of Mexicans or Latinos. Ohio has a growing Mexican and Latino population, especially in cities like Akron and Canton.
Another destination was the Northeastern United States, in places such as the Monongahela Valley, Pennsylvania; Mahoning Valley, Ohio; Hudson Valley and Long Island of New York state; the Jersey Shore region and Southern New Jersey, especially in Freehold Borough; the New Haven, Connecticut area along with other Latin American nationalities; throughout Massachusetts; Washington, D.C. with Maryland and Northern Virginia included; some parts of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Delaware; and the area's largest Mexican immigrant population is the Philadelphia metropolitan area with the Delaware Valley when the local economy boomed in the 1990s and 2000s, but in all US regions, the Mexican national population has begun to decline from the late 2000s recession. A lot of Mexicans and Hispanics currently reside in many places along the Delaware Valley (housing construction employment boom), such as Bridgeton, New Jersey; Camden, New Jersey; Lambertville, New Jersey; Salem, New Jersey; Trenton, New Jersey; Bensalem, Pennsylvania; Chester, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania; North Penn Valley, Pennsylvania; Pocono Mountains (PA) region; Souderton, Pennsylvania; and West Chester, Pennsylvania. There has been large growth in Mexican and Latino communities in Providence, Rhode Island; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Wilmington, Delaware and Youngstown, Ohio areas. 
Communities that consist mostly of recent-arrived immigrants from Mexico, are also present in other parts of the rural Southern United States, in states such as Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas and (part of the Southwest) Oklahoma. A growing Mexican-American population is also present in urban areas such as Orlando, Florida with the Central Florida region included; the Lake Okeechobee area of Florida; the Atlanta metropolitan area; the Memphis, Tennessee area; Charlotte, North Carolina-with a majority Hispanic enclave of Eastland; and Mexican immigration throughout the Piedmont of North Carolina: i.e. Siler City, North Carolina and Henderson County, North Carolina; New Orleans which increased after Hurricane Katrina in Sep. 2005; the Hampton Roads, Virginia area; housing construction and remodeling brought large numbers of Mexicans into Oconee County, South Carolina; the Charleston, South Carolina and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina areas; and Ridgeland, South Carolina.
There is also a large growth of Mexican Americans moving to suburbs and desert regions in the West Coast.
