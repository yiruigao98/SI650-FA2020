== History ==
Sollentuna municipality was founded in conjunction with the reform of local government in Sweden in 1863. However, its boundaries are almost  equivalent to those of Sollentuna Parish, which dates back to the 12th century. Well into the 20th century, Sollentuna was a predominantly rural area.
Modern Sollentuna evolved around the railway between Uppsala and Stockholm, inaugurated in 1866. Five of the eight districts that make up the municipality today correspond to railway stations, now operated by Stockholm commuter rail system. From south to north: Helenelund, Tureberg (railway station is Sollentuna Station), Häggvik, Norrviken and Rotebro. Viby is an extension of Norrviken and the two remaining districts— Edsberg and Sjöberg—are found along the road to Danderyd. Other roads into Sollentuna includes the road from Kallhäll to Rotebro and the E 4 motorway that approximates the same route as the railway.
Sollentuna received the title of a merchant town (köping) in 1944. Köping status was made obsolete by the municipal reform of 1971.
