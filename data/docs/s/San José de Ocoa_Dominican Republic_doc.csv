== History ==
The town was founded in 1805 by people from the southern town of Baní. The Canarian descendants were the first ethnic group to settle in San José de Ocoa, remaining a significant minority in the town. Other families from Spain, Italy and France, notably the Minyettys, would soon follow. Blacks also would later settle in San José de Ocoa, most of them being Cocolo descendants arriving from San Pedro de Macoris. In December 1858, San José de Ocoa was elevated to the category of municipality in the former province of Santo Domingo; in 1895, it was transferred to the province of Azua. In 1944 when the province of Peravia was created, San José de Ocoa became a municipality of this province. Finally, the town became the capital municipality of the new province of San José de Ocoa on 6 September 2000.
