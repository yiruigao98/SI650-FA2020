Truro and St Austell was a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.


== Boundaries ==
The District of Carrick wards of Boscawen, Chacewater, Feock, Kea, Kenwyn, Moresk, Newlyn, Perranzabuloe, Probus, Roseland, St Agnes, St Clement, Tregolls, and Trehaverne, and the Borough of Restormel wards of Crinnis, Mevagissey, Poltair, Rock, St Ewe, St Mewan, St Stephen-in-Brannel, Trevarna, and Treverbyn.
The constituency was centred on the former district of Carrick, which contains the city of Truro, and the former borough of Restormel which contains the town of St Austell.


=== Boundary review ===
Following their review of parliamentary representation in Cornwall, the Boundary Commission for England created an extra seat for the county which meant consequential changes for the existing seats. Truro and St Austell was abolished, and was partly succeeded by St Austell and Newquay.
The city of Truro forms part of the newly created Truro and Falmouth constituency.


== History ==
The constituency has existed in a number of different forms. The Truro constituency, up until 1885 elected two members to parliament; this was reduced to one. In 1918 the constituency was abolished but it was recreated again in 1950.
In 1997, in spite of the fact that no boundary changes were made to Truro on that occasion, the Boundary Commission nonetheless saw fit to change its name to Truro and St. Austell, reflecting the fact that St Austell has a larger population than Truro. The Truro seat became a safe Liberal seat due to the popularity of its former MP, David Penhaligon. He died in a car crash in 1986, aged 42 and was succeeded at a by-election the following year by Matthew Taylor, who held the seat comfortably until his retirement, and the constituency's abolition, in 2010.
