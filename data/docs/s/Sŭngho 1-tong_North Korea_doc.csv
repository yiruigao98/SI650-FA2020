The election of deputies to the 14th Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) was held in North Korea on 10 March 2019. The elections were announced on 6 January 2019. With only one candidate on the ballot in each constituency, outside observers recognized it as a show election. 687 for the DPRK deputies to the SPA were elected. Kim Jong-un did not stand for election, marking the first time that a North Korean leader did not participate as a candidate.


== Preparations ==
On 8 January 2019, the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) issued Decision No. 220, which announced the election of deputies to the 14th Supreme People's Assembly. This was followed three days later by the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly issuing Decision No. 221, which organized a central election committee for the election of the 14th Supreme People's Assembly that consists of Yang Hyong-sop as chairman, Kim Phyong-hae as vice chairman, Jong Yong-guk as secretary general, as well as Choe Pu-il, Kim Yong-dae, Kim Yong-ho, Pak Chol-min, Ju Yong-gil, Kim Chang-yop, Jang Chun-sil, Ri Tu-song, Pak Myong-chol and Ryo Jong-son as members.The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on 29 January that the constituencies and sub-constituencies for the election of the 14th Supreme People's Assembly had been organized, and, on 3 February, reported that election committees had been organized in the constituencies and sub-constituencies. On 21 February, the Workers' Party of Korea Publishing House produced posters urging voters to "further glorify socialism of our style on the strength of single-minded unity" and to "cement our revolutionary power as firm as a rock." On 24 February, the KCNA reported that sub-constituency committees have displayed lists of eligible voters for the election. On 25 February, the Rodong Sinmun published an editorial calling for elevated political enthusiasm and participation in the elections. The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland issued a similar appeal and sought for the social and economic prosperity of the nation coupled with peaceful relations (and a reunification) with South Korea. On 2 March, the Korean Central Television broadcast similar slogans.On 4 March, the Rodong Sinmun published a commentary saying that the North Korean election system is "the most superior in the world."On 7 March, the Central Election Committee reported that the nomination and registration of candidates has been completed. On 8 March, the KCNA reported that profiles of candidates in the election have been displayed at all constituencies, and polling stations have been set up.


== Voting practices and procedures ==
According to outside observers, the proceedings are a show election. It is also believed that the legislature wields no influence on the state-policies and serves as a rubber-stamp to decisions taken by the party machinery.Voting is mandatory, and choice of candidates is not offered. The voters are given a ballot paper with a single name and they are expected to drop it in the ballot box. Although voters are able to signify dissent by crossing the name off, or by not voting at all, analysts argue that such actions would be considered as an act of treason and incur the wrath of the secret police.
