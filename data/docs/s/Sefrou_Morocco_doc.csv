== History ==
Sefrou was named for the Ahel Sefrou, a Berber tribe that once inhabited the area.Sefrou's name might be brought from the berber  name "Asfru" (ⴰⵙⴼⵔⵓ) which means "the solution" (in Morocco) . 
Sefrou was once home to one of the largest settlements of Moroccan Jews, the population estimated to have been as high as 8,000. The first Jewish people lived in the area of the Ahel Sefrou, most of whom were converted to Judaism around 2,000 years ago. In the 8th century, most of these were converted to Islam under Idris I of Morocco. In the 9th century, a second Jewish population settled from the Tafilalt area and Southern Algeria. Most of the descendants of these Jews stayed in Sefrou until 1967, when many moved to Israel.Idris II of Morocco lived in Sefrou temporarily while overseeing the development of Fez.
