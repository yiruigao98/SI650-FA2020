Seabrook is a city in Harris County in the U.S. state of Texas, with some water surface area located within Chambers County.  The population was 11,952 at the 2010 census. Several fish markets line the city's waterfront, while antique shops and bed and breakfast establishments are found in the city's downtown area. The city is home to several miles of trails, which connect multiple city parks to each other.


== History ==

Seabrook is known for its fish markets on Waterfront Drive where resident shrimpers and fishermen bring in their catches daily. Besides bordering the bay, the city encompasses marshes through which runoff from inland fields drain to the bay. The piece of land was purchased by Seabrook W. Sydnor, who was the son of a Galveston slave trader, John Seabrook Sydnor in 1895. In March 1903, the Seabrook Company of Houston created a layout of the proposed Seabrook Town site. The new town attracted fishermen, merchants and even a few residents.
The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 demolished the local school, but by 1905 it was restored and was run by three teachers who taught 100 students. The local schools became part of the Clear Creek Independent School District in 1947. The population of Seabrook rose from 200 to 560 before the Great Depression, but fell to 200 in 1936, and remained at 400 from 1940 until 1947, when the Albert and Ernest Fay shipyard opened. It could handle 150 boats, and opened up jobs and is the main cause of the population increase. Despite damage from Hurricane Carla, a bridge linking Seabrook and Kemah was completed in 1961. With the opening of the bridge and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Seabrook's population rose to approximately 6,000.
In 1986, the decision was made to start the construction of a fixed-span bridge that was tall enough for sailboats to pass under. After this bridge was finished, Highway 146 was linked all the way from Galveston to Texas State Highway 225. This spurred a further increase in the population of Seabrook to its present level of nearly 12,000 people. Seabrook's residents are quite diversified and are employed in a variety of professional positions. Quite a few residents have ties to the chemical and oil industry as well as the NASA space program.

=== Pelican Project ===

The goal of the Pelican Path Project has been to improve Seabrook's identity as a community and one of the largest migratory paths in North America, and a bird sanctuary  to both the brown and white pelicans. The project also displays connectedness of the city by its many bed and breakfasts, close family values, available water attractions and its unique downtown of small businesses.
Most businesses in Seabrook have purchased a pelican from Pelican Project and have customized it to represent their type of business, as well as the city of Seabrook. This project has not only attracted tourism to Seabrook, but united the businesses of the city.  Artists from all over Texas have participated in this project, which has attracted future plans for more cultural art projects in Seabrook.

There are 8 miles (13 km) of continuous trails from Hammer Street to Galveston Bay at Pine Gully Park, where the Lucky Trails Marathon is run in March.

In addition to the city being designated as a bird sanctuary, the city includes four sites on the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail. The only other site in the Clear Lake area on this Texas trail is the Armand Bayou Nature Center.

== Damage from Hurricane Ike ==

The city of Seabrook was under mandatory evacuation for Hurricane Ike on the morning of September 13, 2008. Hurricane Ike was the 3rd most destructive hurricane to hit the United States. In Seabrook, the storm surge not only knocked out the streets as a means of transportation, but also knocked the power out for the entire city, along with many others. Because Seabrook is surrounded by water, the aftermath of debris and boats on the roads was phenomenal from all of the boat docks close to shore.  Seabrook residents were left without power and running water for up to a month after Hurricane Ike made landfall.A month after the hurricane, Seabrook was still dealing with people not being able to live in the conditions, even after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) came. The students zoned to schools in the Clear Creek Independent School District (which are all the residents in Seabrook) missed almost three weeks of school due to the evacuation and the damage to buildings and roads in the Seabrook and surrounding areas.


== Sister cities ==
On June 19, 2002 the cities of Seabrook and Isla Santa Cruz, Ecuador finalized a sister city status during a ceremony at Seabrook City Hall. As part of the agreements the City of Seabrook planned to build a $500,000 ($676797.04 according to inflation), 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) Ecuador visitors' center, which was to include a museum, a multimedia cultural center, and retail shops. Ecuador stated that it had secured $450,000 of the funds as of January 1, 2004. In May 2004 the city asked for an additional $150,000 in private funding and stated that the center may not be built if it does not get this funding.
