== Etymology ==
There are many theories regarding the origin of the name of Sarikei. Once upon a time, Sarikei was the centre for buying and selling chickens and hence it was called "Sa-rie-kei" ("Sa-rie" in most Chinese dialects means "centre" and "kei" means "chicken"). Later the spelling was changed to Sarikei. Another explanation is that it comes from the name of a settlement named "Sa-ley" (沙厘) along Rajang River which later had a bazaar called "Ba-sha" (巴刹). The Cantonese people living there called the bazaar as "Jie-shi" or "Shi-jie" (街市 or 市街); and going to bazaar is known as "Li-jie" (里街). Thus when 沙里街 (Sa-li-jie) is romanised to English, it became "Sarikei". Another theory stated that there was a stall selling red wood tile (红柴瓦) in the bazaar where the Cantonese people also called "Sa-ley" (沙厘), giving rise to the name of "Sarikei". For the indigenous people living there, Sarikei is known as "Siriki". Another theory was that Sarikei" was named after a beautiful woman named "Sareke" who was married to the son (named "Bujang") of a headman (named "Sigalang") of the Sigalang community which existed since 300 years ago.


== History ==

The Sigalang community is known to be the first community to exist in the Sarikei area 300 years ago which was located between Sarikei and Nyelong rivers where both rivers drained into the Rajang river. They were known to be skillful farmers, hunters, and house builders. The Sigalang community was named of its headman who was fair and just and took great care of the community. In the 1840s, the trade at Rajang River was controlled by Malays at Sarikei. Among the most powerful Malays was Datuk Patinggi Abdul Rahman. Among the popular items being traded at Sarikei was rice, beeswax, jungle produce, fine clothes and dried fish. Rajah James Brooke first visited Sarikei on 30 April 1845 in his steamer H.E.I.C.S. Phlegethon. In 1846, James Brooke wanted Abdul Rahman to control the piracy of the Iban people but Abdul Rahman failed to contain the Ibans. In 1853, James Brooke was able to take over Rajang River and its surrounding settlements from the Brunei Sultanate.  Rentap, an Iban freedom fighter against the Brookes from 1849 to 1861, was buried in the present day Bukit Sibau, Pakan District of the Sarikei Division. Syarif Masahor with his ally (the Iban people) attacked Abdul Rahman. He gained control of Sarikei from 1849 until 1861. On 4 January 1856, Sarikei was burnt by Dayaks from Julau. In the same month, James Brooke set up a fort in Sarikei to suppress any piracy activities by the upriver Iban people. The fort was built for Brooke allies led by Abang Ali and Abang Asop. This has angered Syarif Masahor. Syarif responded by building a bigger military force. This led the Brookes to reinstate Syarif as the leader of Sarikei in September 1857 in exchange for Brooke's control of Mukah. On 19 June 1856, Sir Charles Brooke led an expedition to Julau in order to counter the native resistance in Julau. The fort at Sarikei was burnt by Charles Johnson Brooke's forces five years after 1856 when they tried to capture Syarif Masahor, Syarif's rule ended in 1861. The administration of Sarikei was later taken over by the Brookes.Hoklo people and the Cantonese people were the first ones to arrive in Sarikei in 1864. They built Attap dwellings and live alongside with the Malays near the riverside. The Chinese rear chickens and planted vegetables. Later the Chinese used timber to build shophouses and started to do grocery businesses. After that, their businesses expanded to include trading with Singapore companies. The number of shophouses grew from four to six shops in 1905. In 1907, the Foochow people arrived Sarikei. As the population and the shophouses near the riverside increased, with several old shophouses tilting towards the riverside; the Brooke government ordered all the shophouses to migrate inland (now Repok road, also known as "backstreet") for safety purposes. The road near the river is known as "frontstreet".  Most of the shophouses were family owned. River was the main mode of transport for Sarikei. Sarikei was connected to Singapore through a steamship that came once a month. As the shipping frequencies increased, warehouses and wharf was built. In 1923, the Chinese in Sarikei constructed the first part of Sarikei-Durin road. In 1932, all the wooden shophouses in Sarikei were rebuilt using concrete. Chinese schools started to increase from the same year. In 1941, Japanese troops occupied Sarawak. However, the Japanese did not take over the local government in Sibu. This created a power vacuum in the central region of Sarawak. This has caused chaos in Sarikei. The local residents in Sarikei had to form their own protection squad to deter piracy activities from the upriver Dayaks. Three months later, the Japanese formally installed a provincial governor at Sibu. Peace was restored but life became harder due to stagnated economic activities. By 1943, Sarikei had 40 concrete shops. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Sarawak was liberated and became British crown colony. In 1952, Cathay cinema was opened.Initially, the Chinese were involved in land disputes with the local indigenous people. However, with Rajah intervention, boundaries between Chinese and indigenous people lands were drawn and both sides agreed to settle down in their own lands. In 1949, black pepper prices started to rise. Residents of Sarikei planted a large number of black pepper plantations. In 1950, the price of rubber rose due to the Korean war. This had caused a booming rubber plantation in Sarikei. Sarikei Chinese Chamber of Commerce was established in 1932 in order to protect Chinese commercial interests. In 1954, the Sarawak colonial government presented a 1955 budget deficit. In order to increase income, the colonial government decided to increase the price of business permit tax. In December 1954, the legislation to increase business permit tax was approved in the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). This has caused the permit tax to increase from 500% to 900%. Sarikei Chinese chamber of Commerce decided to organise a strike for ten days in protest of increased taxes. The third division (today Sibu Division) Resident came to persuade the Chinese in Sarikei to stop the strike but to no avail. The strike proceed from 1 January 1955 to 10 January 1955. This strike received full support from Chinese merchants from Kuching, Sibu, Bintangor, and Selangau. Chinese merchants from Kapit strike for eight days while Miri, Bintulu, Mukah, and Saratok strike for three days. However, the strike failed to stop the business permit tax; and the taxation continues after the formation of Malaysia and is listed under the jurisdiction of Sarawak state government.In the 1950s, Sarikei was a district under the jurisdiction of Sibu Division. In 1973, Sarikei was upgraded into the sixth division of Sarawak, covering 6,969 km2, consisting of Sarikei, Meradong, Julau, Matu, Daro, Balawai, and Pakan districts with a population of 151,300 people. The creation of Sarikei Division was to more effectively counter the communist insurgency in Sarawak. In 2002, the Sarawak government separated Matu, Daro, and Tanjung Manis districts from Sarikei to be incorporated into the newly created Mukah Division, thus leaving Sarikei Division with only Sarikei, Pakan, Meradong, and Julau districts, covering 4,857 kmkm2 with a population of 117,837 people.
