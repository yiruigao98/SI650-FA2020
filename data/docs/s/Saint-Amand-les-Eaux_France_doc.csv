=== The ancient faience factories ===
Saint Amand is known for its faience, produced, in the past, by ancient faience factories who was used the bianco sopra bianco technical.

1705 Nicolas Demoutier built a faience factory, managed by himself and by the family Dorez, descendants of Bartélémy a ceramist from Lille, in the next place. The faience factory equipment was sold to Bécart in 1775, who has been installed this firm in Valenciennes.
1718, the Fauquez family built their faience factory. They were natives of Tournai in Belgium. The roads, waterways and forests were favourable for transporting the products, so they set up their firm in Saint Amand. But the Treaty of Utrecht, which set the frontier between Tournai and Saint Amand forbade the transport of faience across the border. The faience was hidden in kegs and hay to cross the frontier. The Fauquez's factory was closed in 1794.
