Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures is a city in central Quebec, Canada, on the Saint Lawrence River, adjacent to Quebec City.
The town was founded in 1691 by three families (Desroches, Racette, Couture). It was merged with Quebec City on January 1, 2002 as part of the 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec and became part of the Laurentien borough of that city. However, after a 2004 referendum it was re-established as a separate city on January 1, 2006.
The local post office was previously named Saint-Augustin-de-Portneuf from 1852, then Saint-Augustin-de-Québec from 1918 until this was renamed to the community's current name in 1986.
