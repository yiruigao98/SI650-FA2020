== History ==
The first Muslim invasion of the Deccan took place in 1296. In 1636 the Nizam Shahi dynasty came to an end. In 1663 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj conquered Parali and Satara fort. After the death of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Shahu  Shivaji, heir apparent to the Maratha Kingdom, captured by Mughals when he was only seven years old, remained their prisoner till the death of his father in 1700. The Dowager Maharani Tarabai proclaimed his younger half-brother, and her son, Shahu Sambhaji as Chhatrapati Maharaj under her regency. Mughals released Shahu under certain preconditions in 1707, so that Marathas would face an internal war for the throne. Shahu returned to the Maratha Empire and claimed his inheritance. Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Azam Shah conquered Satara fort (Ajinkyatara) after a 6-month siege, later won by Parshuram Pratinidhi in 1706. In 1708 Chattrapati Shahu, the son of Sambhaji, was crowned at the Satara fort. The direct descendants of Raja Shivaji continue to live in Satara. Udayanraje Bhonsle is the 13th descendant of Shivaji Maharaj.
