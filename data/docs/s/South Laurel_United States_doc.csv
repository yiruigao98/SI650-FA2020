== History ==

Following the 1881 construction of the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad through the area, economic development occurred rapidly. The city of Laurel was incorporated in 1882, with timber as the impetus. Yellow pine forests in the region fueled the industry. The city was named for laurel thickets near the original town site.John Kamper built Laurel's first mill, which was small and primitive. On the verge of bankruptcy in 1891, Kamper sold the mill and extensive land holdings, totaling 15,000+ acres, to Clinton, Iowa, lumber barons Lauren Chase Eastman and George and Silas Gardiner. In 1893, the Eastman-Gardiner mill opened and employed the best technology and labor-saving devices of the day. This mill was followed by the Gilchrist-Fordney mill from Alpena, Michigan, in 1906, the Wausau-Southern milll from Wausau, Wisconsin, in 1911, and the Marathon mill from Memphis, Tennessee, in 1914. Following World War I, Laurel shipped more yellow pine than any other location in the entire world. The peak of lumber prosperity was reached in the 1920s, when the area's four mills were producing a total of one million board feet of lumber per day – enough laid end to end to stretch 189 miles.The economic prosperity of Laurel's timber era (1893–1937) and "timber families" created the famed Laurel Central Historic District as a byproduct. The area is considered the largest, finest, and most intact collection of the early 20th century architecture in Mississippi and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since September 4, 1987, for both its history and wide variety of architectural styles. Many of the homes and buildings of the district are featured on the HGTV series Home Town. In addition to influencing a diverse architectural district, the "timber families" influenced the building of broad avenues, the design of public parks, and the development of strong schools.
The city population grew markedly during the early 20th century because rural people were attracted to manufacturing jobs and the economic takeoff of Masonite International. Mechanization of agriculture reduced the number of farming jobs. In 1942, Howard Wash, a 45-year-old African-American man who had been convicted of murder, was dragged from jail and lynched by a mob. The city reached its peak of population in 1960, and has declined about one third since then.
