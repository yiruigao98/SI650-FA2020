== History ==
San Cristóbal was founded in the late 16th century. Being the 3rd most important city in the country, its nickname "La Ciudad Benemerita" means "City deserving of grace".
The Constitution of the Dominican Republic was signed in San Cristobal in 1844. Rafael Trujillo, dictator from 1930 to 1961; was born in San Cristobal in 1891 and killed by anti-dictatorial Dominicans on his way to San Cristobal in 1961 as part of a successful plot to end his 30-year authoritarian and fascist regime. Trujillo had several properties in San Cristobal among these were: 

El Castillo El Cerro
La Casa de Playa de Najayo o Casa de Marfil
La Hacienda María o Casa Blanca
La Casa de Caoba (his favorite home)All of these buildings are still standing, though in poor conditions. He built many monuments in his hometown, such as Balneario La Toma, and Parque Piedras Vivas- a park he ordered to be built from rocks and stones collected from each city of the Dominican Republic to honor himself (hence the park's name "Living Stones").
