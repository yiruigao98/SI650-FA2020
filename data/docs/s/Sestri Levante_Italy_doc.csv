Sestri Levante (Latin: Segesta Tigullorum/Segesta Tigulliorum) is a town and comune in Liguria, Italy. Lying on the Mediterranean Sea, it is approximately 56 km (35 miles) south of Genoa and is set on a promontory. While nearby Portofino and the Cinque Terre are probably the best-known tourist destinations on the Italian Riviera, Sestri Levante is becoming quite a favorite among Italians. This once quiet fishing village is slowly turning into a tourist hotspot, developing an old and a new town.


== Geography ==
Sestri Levante is found approximately halfway between Genoa and La Spezia. The town has two bays: Baia delle Favole, (Bay of the Fables), and Baia del Silenzio, the (Bay of Silence). The original part of Sestri Levante is actually on a peninsula, with the Baia del Silenzio (also known as "Portobello") on one side and Baia delle Favole on the other. Baia delle Favole or “Bay of Fairy Tales” was named in honor of Danish writer, Hans Christian Andersen, who lived in Sestri Levante for a short time in 1833.


== History ==
Sestri Levante has its origins as an ancient maritime and merchant center. Originally a small island with a promontory, it was later connected to the mainland. In Roman times, it was known as Segesta Tigullorum (or Tigulliorum) or simply Segesta, but the place was nearly abandoned when the Roman empire collapsed. It seems to have belonged to the Ligurian tribe of the Tigullii. It was mentioned again in the year 909 in a certificate of Berengar I of Italy, in which part of its territory was ceded to the basilica di San Giovanni di Pavia. During the Middle Ages, Sestri Levante began to expand, probably giving the fortress appearance that is due to the terrain.
In 1133, the noble family of Lavagna, the Fieschi, attacked Tigullio, the gulf in which Sestri Levante is located, however, they were fought off by the powerful Republic of Genoa, and therefore, Sestri Levante became a part of the republic, for military protection. In the year 1145, the abbey of San Colombano was acquired by the Genoese, and was transformed later into a castle.
In 1170, Sestri Levante was attacked by a naval flotilla from Pisa, but was able to withstand the attack.


== Economy ==
Cantiere navale di Riva Trigoso is a shipyard founded in 1897 by Erasmo Piaggio in Riva Trigoso, it mostly built commercial ships. In 1925 the Piaggio heirs decided to spin off the drydock business and the company was renamed Cantieri del Tirreno. It diversified into building warships and was heavily damaged during World War II. The shipyard was merged into Italcantieri in 1973 and then into Fincantieri in 1984.


== Cultural depictions ==
