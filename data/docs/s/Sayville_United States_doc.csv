== List of members representing the district ==


=== 1789–1805: one seat ===


=== 1805–1809: Two seats on general ticket with 3rd district ===
Gurdon S. Mumford is usually listed as member from the 2nd district, and George Clinton Jr. from the 3rd district, because Clinton was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Mitchill to the U.S. Senate, and Mitchill had been elected previously in the 3rd district. However, in 1804 Mitchill was already re-elected on the 2nd/3rd general ticket, and both Clinton and Mumford were elected in special elections, receiving votes in both districts.

The districts were separated in 1809.


=== 1809–1823: two seats ===
From 1809 to 1823, two seats were apportioned to the second district, elected at-large on a general ticket.


=== 1823–present: one seat ===
