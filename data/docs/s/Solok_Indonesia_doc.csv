== Cities proper by population ==
The Indonesian law defines a city (kota) as a second-level administrative subdivision of the country, similar to regency (kabupaten). The difference between a regency and a city lies in demography, size, and economy. Generally, a city has non-agricultural economic activities, while a regency comprises a rural area larger than a city. A city is headed by a mayor (walikota). An administrative city is a city without its own local legislatures (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah). The mayor of an administrative city is directly appointed by the Governor. This type of city in Indonesia is only found in Jakarta which consisted of 5 administrative cities and 1 administrative regency.
