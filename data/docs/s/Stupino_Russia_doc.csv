This is a list of cities and towns in Russia with a population of over 50,000 as of the 2010 Census. These numbers are the population within the limits of the city/town proper, not the urban area or metropolitan area figures.
The list excludes the city of Sevastopol and locations within the Republic of Crimea, since those were not subject to the 2010 Census as constituent parts of Ukraine. The city of Zelenograd (a part of the federal city of Moscow) and the municipal cities/towns of the federal city of St. Petersburg are also excluded, as they are not enumerated in the 2010 Census as stand-alone localities.  Note that the sixteen largest cities have a total population of 35,798,844, or roughly 24.4% of the country's total population.

Cities in bold symbolize the capital city of its respective federal subject. Three capitals are too small to make the list: Naryan-Mar (pop. 25,151), Anadyr (pop. 15,819), and Magas (pop. 12,170). Pyatigorsk is the administrative centre of North Caucasian Federal District but not of any federal subject.
