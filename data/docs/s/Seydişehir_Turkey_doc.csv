== History ==
Seydişehir has an extensive historical record extending back many centuries. In 5500 BC, Seydişehir bordered the ancient province of Psidia  and some historical building may date to this era. The city is situated in a valley between Lake Trogitis and Lake Karalis.  Pre-historic buildings are preserved within the valley. Many artefacts from this era are housed in the Konya Archaeological Museum. In 2000–700 BC, the Hittite conquerors of middle Anatolia left their mark in the way of symbols and handiwork. Rock reliefs found in Seydişehir, believed to be made by the Hittite, support the idea of Hittite's living in the area.
