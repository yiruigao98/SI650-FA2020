Santo Domingo de los Colorados, simply referred to as Santo Domingo (Quechua: Tsachila) is a city and seat of the canton that bears its name. It is the fourth most populous city in Ecuador with a population of over 460,000, is an important commercial and industrial center, and serves as the capital of the Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas Province.


== History ==
The name, "de los Colorados", refers to a local ethnic group, the Tsáchila, and the custom of men in that tribe to dye their hair with extract of the achiote plant; hence "Santo Dominigo de los Colorados" or "Santo Domingo of the Dyed." This group, which is indigenous to the area, is recognised with a substantial statue near the town center.
In c1936, Sr. Mario Borja, a surveyor and civil engineer for the government of Ecuador, son of Senator-General Philemon Borja, was hired to survey a road from Quito to a settlement within the Tsachila community. After several months, the survey crew arrived at a settlement at the Tuacha River. Mario Borja, as delegate to the Ecuadorian government, officially founded the town of Santo Domingo del Los Colorados and designed the town center.
