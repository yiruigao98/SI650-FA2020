General Trias, officially the City of General Trias (Tagalog: Lungsod ng General Trias), is a 1st class city in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 314,303 people.


== Etymology ==
During the earlier part of the Spanish colonial period, General Trias was often referred to as Las Estancias (the ranches), which was once a part of Cavite el Viejo, the present-day Kawit. It was also called Malabón Grande. The name Malabón was speculated to have been derived from either the local term "maraming labong," due to the abundance of bamboo shoots in the area, which is a main ingredient in Filipino cuisine; or from "mayabong," referring to the trees and other plants once abundant in the place.
At any rate, the first reference seems to be more probable because General Mariano Trías, a noted writer, adopted the nom de guerre "Labong," a word he often used in his writing and conversation. Grande, on the other hand, was affixed to the appellation because at the time, the place was a vast wilderness covering Sitio Tejero, frequently called by the revolutionary as Salinas (present-day Rosario), Santa Cruz de Malabón or Malabón el Chico (present-day Tanza) and Tierra Alta (present-day Noveleta). When the town was made independent from Cavite el Viejo, it was finally called by its popular name San Francisco de Malabón, in honor of patron saint, Saint Francis of Assisi (1181-1200).


== History ==


=== First Cry of Cavite ===
The first uprising in Cavite known as the "First Cry of Cavite" occurred in San Francisco de Malabón about ten o’clock in the morning of 31 August 1896, when the town tribunal was attacked by Filipino revolutionaries led by Mariano Trías, Diego Mojica and Nicolas Portilla in Pasong Kalabaw (now known as Santa Clara). The second incident followed at twelve noon at Tierra Alta and the third in Cavite el Viejo between two and three o’clock in the afternoon.


=== Tejeros Convention ===
A chapter of the Katipunan known as Balangay Mapagtiis had already been in existence in the place for sometime. The Sangguniang Bayang Magdiwang headed by General Mariano Álvarez of Tierra Alta and the Sangguniang Bayang Mapagtiis of San Francisco de Malabón later merged under the name Magdiwang Council with General Alvarez as president. The Magdiwang Council hosted the Tejeros Convention on 22 March 1897 in a friar estate house in Sitio Tejero wherein Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo was elected president and Mariano Trías, then lieutenant general, as vice-president in a revolutionary government replacing the Katipunan.


=== Renamed as General Trias ===
On 28 February 1914, Act No. 2390 was passed by the Philippine Assembly, changing the town's name to Malabón. On February 24, 1920, Act No. 2889 was approved renaming the town after one of its most famous son, General Mariano Trías.
