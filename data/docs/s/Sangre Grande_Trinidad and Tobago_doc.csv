== Trinidad ==
Before 1991 Trinidad was divided into eight counties.


== Tobago ==
Tobago is a ward of Trinidad and Tobago and is governed locally by the Tobago House of Assembly.
Historically, Tobago was divided into seven parishes (Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Mary, Saint Patrick and Saint Paul). In 1768 each parish of Tobago had nominated representatives to the Tobago House of Assembly.  On 20 October 1889 the British crown implemented a Royal Order in Council constituting Tobago as a ward of Trinidad, thus terminating local government on Tobago and formed a unified colony government.
In 1945 when the county council system was first introduced, Tobago was administered as a single county of Trinidad.
In 1980 provisions were made for the Tobago House of Assembly to be revived as an entity providing local government in Tobago.  Under the revived system, Tobago is made up of 12 local electoral districts with each district electing one Assemblyman to the THA.
