The city's site has been of military importance ever since the Romans built a fort there. Saïda was a stronghold of Abd al-Qadir, the Algerian national leader, who burned the town as French forces approached it in 1844.Modern Saïda was founded as a French military outpost in 1854 and once housed a regiment of the French Foreign Legion. Its growth was stimulated by the arrival of the Oran-Béchar (narrow-gauge) railway in 1862.
In 2005 the population was 158,856 inhabitants. It is nicknamed the city of waters, because of its abundant underground springs. The area is forested and the main products of the town are cereals, wool, leather and bottled mineral waters.
