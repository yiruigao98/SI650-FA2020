== Etymology ==
Shahr-e Kord, at face value, seems to mean "City of the Kurds". In antiquity, the place had been called "Dezh Gord" (دژگرد), where dezh (دژ) means "fortress" and gord (گرد) means "hero". After the Muslim conquest of Persia, the name changed to "Deh Kord" (Persian: دهكرد‎); dezh was reinterpreted as deh (ده) meaning "village" and gord became kord because the Arabic alphabet lacks the letter "g" (گ). Other examples of cities whose names changed partly due to the influence of the Arabic language are Chamgordan, Boroujerd and Dezful, which were called Chamgord, Borougord and Dezhpol, respectively, before the Islamic conquest. In 1935, the name was finally changed to its present form with deh being replaced with shahr (شهر) meaning "city", which better reflects the size of Shahr-e Kord.
