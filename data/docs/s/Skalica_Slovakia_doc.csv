Skalica (German: Skalitz, Hungarian: Szakolca, Latin: Sakolcium) is the largest town in Skalica District in western Slovakia in the Záhorie region. Located near the Czech border, Skalica has a population of around 15,000.


== Etymology ==
The name is derived from Slovak word skala (a rock) referring to the cliffs the inhabitants built their settlement over.  The first written record of Skalica was made in 1217 as Szacholca.


== History ==
The site has been inhabited since 4000 BC and was part of the Great Moravian Empire. From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary.  The settlement developed around a triangular plaza, which was rare during the Middle Ages. Its town privileges were conferred in 1372 by King Louis I of Hungary. In 1428 Skalica became a bastion for the Hussites; during the Hussite Wars, the majority of its then predominantly German-speaking populace fled or was exiled. Many Habaners (adherents of a sect similar to Anabaptism) settled in Skalica in the 16th century. 
On 6 November 1918 Skalica became the seat of the Temporary Government of Slovakia, for ten days de facto capital of Slovakia. The Temporary Government led by Vavro Šrobár declared here a sovereignty of the Czechoslovak state, published a newspaper Sloboda (Liberty) and unsuccessfully tried to negotiate the removal of Hungarian troops from Upper Hungary (today Slovakia).
After World War II, the town tried to take advantage of its position as a district town, and many new works, schools and apartments blocks were built, while successfully preserving its historical city centre. In 1960, Skalica became part of Senica district. This lasted until 1996, when Skalica became a separate district again.
Didaktik computers were produced in Skalica during the 1980s. The 2006 European Table Hockey Championships were held in the town.
A popular pastry called trdelník is made in Skalica. Now sold all over Slovakia and Czechia, this unusual "stove-pipe" shaped pastry has its origins in Transylvania. 
Today, it is economically the strongest town in the Záhorie region, bypassing its rival town Senica for this position, and is becoming a tourist destination thanks to its preserved town centre and historical monuments.
