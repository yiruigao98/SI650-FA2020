In winter, numerous ski resorts come to life. Due to the town's rural nature, low income and low population Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, Japan's richest man at the time, was able to build a large ski area and hotel without the kind of "organized opposition of environmentalists" which stymied his plans elsewhere in Japan.

The farm has been used as a shooting location for television dramas and movies. Every year Koiwai Farm puts on the Koiwai Snow Festival (小岩井雪祭, Koiwai Yuki Matsuri).
