Municipalities in Brunei are settlements which have been incorporated by the government to run as municipalities. They are independent from the hierarchy of the country's subdivisions but nevertheless overlap with mukims and villages, the second- and third-level administrative divisions of Brunei. The governing body of a municipality is municipal department (Malay: jabatan bandaran) which is a government department under the Ministry of Home Affairs; the head is a chairman (Malay: pengerusi, officially Pengerusi Lembaga Bandaran) which is equivalent to mayor.

There are four settlements in Brunei which have municipal status, namely Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei; Kuala Belait, a town and capital of Belait District; Seria, a town also in Belait District; and Tutong, the town of Tutong District. Although Muara in Brunei-Muara District and Bangar, the capital of Temburong District, are officially known in Malay as Pekan Muara and Pekan Bangar (literally 'Muara Town' and 'Bangar Town'), they do not have municipal status but instead administered as village-level subdivisions.
