During the Ottoman administration (16th-18th century), Pazova was populated by ethnic Serbs and was part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Syrmia. In 1718, the town became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the 18th century (after 1760) Lutheran Slovaks settled in Pazova, and in 1791 Germans arrived here as well. The Germans lived in a separate settlement known as Nova Pazova ("New Pazova"), thus the old settlement was named Stara Pazova ("Old Pazova").
