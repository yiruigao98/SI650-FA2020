== History ==
Mansa District was formerly a part of the Phulkia Sikh Dynasty (1722–1948) then part of Kaithal Sikh Kingdom (1762–1857).
The present district was formed on 13 April 1992 from the erstwhile Bathinda district. The town is said to have been founded by Bhai Gurdas who hailed from Dhingar, Mansa district. He is said to have been married at this place among the Dhaliwal Jat Sikh. Once he came to his in-laws to take his wife along with him but they refused to send her. At this, Bhai Gurdas sat in meditation before the house of his in-laws. After some time, the parents of the girl agreed to send their daughter with Bhai Gurdas. But he refused to take her along with him, stating that he had now renounced the worldly way of life. In his memory, his Smadh was constructed where a fair is held every year in March–April. People in large numbers attend the fair and offer Laddus and Gur (jaggery) at Smadh. Class ‘A’ municipality has been functioning in the town since 1952. The town has two Colleges, viz. Govt.
