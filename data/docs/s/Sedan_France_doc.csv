Club Sportif Sedan Ardennes, commonly referred to as CS Sedan or simply Sedan (French pronunciation: ​[sədɑ̃]), is a French association football club based in Sedan. The club was formed in 1919 and plays its home matches at the Stade Louis Dugauguez located within the city.  Sedan is sponsored by Invicta France and Caisse d'Épargne, the latter being one of France's largest banks.


== Colours and badge ==
Sedan's home strip always includes red and green, and this is reflected in the club badge. The badge also incorporates the image of a wild boar, a symbol of the Ardennes region, hence the club's nickname is Les Sangliers (the wild boars).


== Supporters ==
Sedan's fanbase is mainly drawn from the surrounding Ardennes region, and particular rivalry is reserved for the derby with nearby club Stade Reims. Although not known for outbreaks of hooliganism, a Sedan home game against Paris Saint Germain in 2007 was widely reported following the arrival of Dutch football hooligans from Utrecht and their ensuing fight with PSG fans.
Sedan does have a small hooligan faction known as the Young Boys, complete with their own designated stadium corner and even their own online gift shop.
