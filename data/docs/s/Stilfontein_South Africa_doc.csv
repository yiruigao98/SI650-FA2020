Stilfontein (Afrikaans for quiet spring) is a mining town with 17,942 inhabitants, situated between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom in North West Province of South Africa.


== History ==
Stilfontein was established in 1949 as a residential centre for three large gold mines, the Hartebeesfontein, Buffelsfontein and Stilfontein mines.
In May 1949 two shafts (Charles and Margaret) were sunk and it was this success at Stilfontein that inspired the opening up of the Hartebeesfontein and Buffelsfontein mines. 
The Margaret shaft at the Stilfontein mine was the first concrete headgear ever to be erected in South Africa and was designed locally and completely constructed form local materials. Tower mounted on this headgear was the first ever multi rope Koepoe hoist in South Africa.
