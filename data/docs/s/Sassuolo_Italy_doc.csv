Sassuolo (Italian pronunciation: [sasˈswɔːlo]; Modenese: Sasōl [saˈsoːl]) is an Italian town, comune, and industrial centre of the Province of Modena, Emilia-Romagna region. The town stands on the right bank of the river Secchia some 17 kilometres (11 mi) southwest of Modena. As of 2015, its population was 40,884.


== History ==
The territory was inhabited in ancient times by the pile-dwelling terramare civilization, then by an Eastern Ligurian tribe called Friniates during the Iron Age. The Celt Boii settled this land beginning from 400 BC, overlapping with the Friniates. The Boii represent the most powerful and numerous Celtic tribe of Northern Italy, or Cisalpine Gaul. They fiercely opposed the Roman conquest of Cisalpine Gaul.
The first historical mention of the town dates to 980. In 1078, the consuls of Sassuolo swore loyalty to the commune of Modena. In 1373, the city passed to the Este family at the request of the citizens themselves, who obtained the right to extract water from the river Secchia.
The town was also the capital of the homonymous signoria (which also included the town of Soliera), led by the house of Pio and existing from 1499 to 1599, when it was directly annexed  to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio of which it remained a possession until the Italian Unification.


=== Title ===
As a titular Duke of Modena, the current holder of the title of "Lord of Sassuolo" would theoretically be Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este; however, the 1947 Constitution of Italy explicitly does not recognize any titles of nobility.
