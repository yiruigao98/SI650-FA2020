== History ==
Governador Aluízio Alves International Airport is a new airport complex in São Gonçalo do Amarante, near Natal, Brazil, built to replace Augusto Severo International Airport.
Planning for the airport started in 2007 envisioning concepts of an intermodal airport, focusing both on passenger and cargo transportation. The complex is expected to have the highest aircraft traffic in the Northeast.On May 12, 2011, the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC) released a document opening the concession of the airport to private entrepreneurs. The auction to choose the winner took place on August 22, 2011. The winner was an Inframérica Consortium, formed by the Brazilian Engineering Group Engevix (50%) and the Argentinean Group Corporación América (50%).After the signature of the contract of concession, works of the passenger and cargo terminals started. Inframérica Consortium had 3 years to build the terminals and is authorized to commercially explore the facility for 25 years (with one possible 5-year extension). Differently from other Infraero airports in process of privatization, in which Infraero retains 49% of the shares, in the case of Natal Consórcio Inframérica got 100% of the shares. On February 6, 2012 Consortium Inframérica also won the concession of Brasília–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport.The airport was opened for operations on May 31, 2014, when airlines moved their domestic operations to this facility. International operations were moved a few days later. The airport is the first airport in Brazil operated by a private sector company.
