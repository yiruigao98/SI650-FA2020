The city tracks its roots from a small village in the headstream of Dovzhyk River (Sharapka). At the end of the 18th century, it was granted by Catherine II of Russia to ataman Vasyl Orlov as a reward for his excellent military service. The farmland took on the name Dovzhykove-Orlovske (Sharapkyne). Development of the area significantly expanded towards the end of the 19th century, after the discovery of coal in the Donetsk region.
In 1938 a number of local settlements as well as the Sverdlov mine (today is part of the Sverdlovantratsyt company) were merged into the city of Sverdlovsk in memory of the Bolshevik leader Yakov Sverdlov.
A local newspaper is published in the city since November 1938.Starting mid-April 2014 pro-Russian separatists captured several towns in Luhansk Oblast; including Sverdlovsk.
