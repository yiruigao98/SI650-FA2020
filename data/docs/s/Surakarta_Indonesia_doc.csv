Surakarta (Javanese: ꦯꦸꦫꦏꦂꦠ), known colloquially as Solo, is a city in Central Java, Indonesia. The 46 km2 (16.2 sq mi) city adjoins Karanganyar Regency and Boyolali Regency to the north, Karanganyar Regency and Sukoharjo Regency to the east and west, and Sukoharjo Regency to the south. On the eastern side of Solo lies Solo River (Bengawan Solo). Its built-up area, consisting of Surakarta Municipality and 59 districts spread over seven regencies, was home to 3,649,254 inhabitants as of 2010 census.Surakarta is the birthplace of the current President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo. He served as Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012.


== Administrative division ==

Surakarta City and its surrounding regencies, Karanganyar, Sragen, Wonogiri, Sukoharjo, Klaten, and Boyolali, are collectively called the ex-Surakarta Residency (Dutch: Residentie Soerakarta). After Surakarta became a city, it was divided into five districts (kecamatan), each led by a camat, and subdivided into 51 kelurahan, each led by a lurah. The districts of Surakarta are:
Kecamatan Pasar Kliwon (Postal code: 57110): 9 kelurahan
Kecamatan Jebres (Postal code: 57120): 11 kelurahan
Kecamatan Banjarsari (Postal code: 57130): 13 kelurahan
Kecamatan Laweyan (also spelled Lawiyan, Postal code: 57140): 11 kelurahan
Kecamatan Serengan (Postal code: 57150): 7 kelurahan


== Greater Surakarta ==
Surakarta as a dense core city in Central Java, and its second city, spills considerably into neighboring regencies. Though a traffic study quotes the population as 1,158,000 as of 2008, this reflects only the very core, as the city affects entire neighboring regencies by significantly driving up overall population densities in Sukoharjo Regency and Klaten Regency over the already dense countryside. Furthermore, the government of Indonesia officially defines a broader region as Surakarta's extended metropolitan zone, with the acronym Subosukawonosraten as the city and 6 surrounding regencies, which reflects a broader planning region, though not a core metropolitan area as some of its regencies are not particularly suburbanized. Both the metropolitan area and extended areas border Yogyakarta's metropolitan area, while only the extended metropolitan area borders Kedungsapur or Greater Semarang.
