Shiojiri is located in former Shinano Province, and as its name implies, was traditionally a centre for salt production. During the Edo period, Narai-juku, Shiojiri-shuku and Seba-juku developed as post stations on the Nakasendō highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. The village of Shiojiri was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was elevated to town status on April 1, 1927. Shiojiri annexed the villages of Kataoka, Hirooka, Souga and Chikumazi on April 1, 1959 and was elevated to city status. Shiojiki lost Kitauchida hamlet and Gakenoyu hamlet (both in Kataoka ward) in 1960 and 1961 to Matsumoto city due to border adjustments. On June 28, 1961, Shiojiri absorbed the village of Seba and the village of Narakawa on April 1, 2005.
