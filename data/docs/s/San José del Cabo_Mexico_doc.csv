== Population ==
In the 2015 census, it had a population of 93,069. Together with neighboring Cabo San Lucas, it forms a major tourist destination for travelers, with over 900,000 hotel guests in 2011.The Mission San José del Cabo was founded in 1730 on the west bank of the nearby Río San José. The Río San José flows into an estuary, the largest body of fresh water in southern Baja California Sur, after flowing largely underground for 39.1 kilometres (24.3 mi) from its origin in the Sierra de la Laguna (Laguna Mountains). For more than 250 years it has furnished drinking and irrigation water for the town of San Jose del Cabo, beginning as a source of fresh water for Spanish galleons traveling back from the Philippines. The river used to flow above ground until the beginning of the 20th century due to anthropogenic causes. A one km long sand bar separates the estuary from what early Spanish explorers, including Sebastian Vizcaino, called the Bahía de San Bernabé or Bay of San Bernabé and now San José del Cabo Bay.San José del Cabo is one of two places where the rare and nearly extinct rice rat Oryzomys peninsulae has been found.


== Climate ==
San José del Cabo, like almost all of the Baja California peninsula, has an arid climate (Köppen BWh) although it does receive more rainfall than most areas further north due to tropical cyclones occasionally coming in from the south and bringing very heavy falls such as 340 millimetres (13.4 in) on the first of September 1998 and 316 millimetres (12.4 in) on 3 November 1993. Overall, however, rainfall is some of the most erratic anywhere in the world due to this influence, and many years pass by without significant falls at all.
The sea experiences lows of 72–73 °F (22–23 °C) in winter, and highs of 77–84 °F (25–29 °C) during the summer months.
