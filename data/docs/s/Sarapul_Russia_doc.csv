== History ==
Sarapul is one of the oldest cities of the Kama region. It was first mentioned in a 1596 population audit book as the village (selo) of Voznesenskoye (Вознесе́нское), later known as Sarapul: in Kazansky Uyezd in the upper Kama River ... in Sarapul and Siva people fish. Apparently, here "Sarapul" is the name of a section of the river, as well as the entire area along its shores. It is believed that the name of this area comes from the word "сарапуль" (sarapul) which in Chuvash means "yellow fish", or sturgeon, which was in abundance here. Later, however, other versions of the origin of the name were considered. In particular, one of them says that the word "sarapul" formed by the merger of two words: "sarah", which in one of the Siberian dialects means "money", and "pul", a small copper coin, thus meaning "place of money".
It was chartered in 1780 and by the end of the 18th century had grown into a merchant town with developed footwear manufacturing industry.
The city of Sarapul was one of the residence centers of the Udmurt Jews, who spoke Udmurtish Yiddish. In the lexicon of this dialect there was a noticeable number of Udmurt and Tatar loan words.
