"Hwanghae Province" or "Hwanghae-do" (Korean pronunciation: [hwaŋ.hɛ.do]) is, according to South Korean law, a province of the Republic of Korea, as the South Korean government formally claims to be the legitimate government of whole of Korea. The area constituting the province is under the de facto jurisdiction of North Korea.
As South Korea does not recognize changes in administrative divisions made by North Korea, official maps of the South Korean government shows Hwanghae Province in its pre-1945 borders. The area corresponds to North Korea's North Hwanghae Province (except Kaesong which is claimed to be part of Gyeonggi Province) and South Hwanghae Province.
To symbolize its claims, the South Korean government established The Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces as an administrative body for the five northern provinces. A governor for Hwanghae Province is appointed by the President of South Korea.
