The territory of Sainte-Julie, was part of the parish of Sainte-Anne-de-Varennes and was informally known as "Grand Coteau". These settlers mostly came from Boucherville.Soon residents, finding the Sainte-Anne-de-Varennes parish too far away, asked to establish their own parish in 1843. In 1850 they received authorization and built a church on land belonging to Julie Gauthier dite St-Germain, who asked that the name of the patron Sainte-Julie be given to the parish after Julia of Corsica, a virgin martyr from the fifth century A.D.On May 6, 1851, a civil proclamation recognized the parish municipality of Sainte-Julie. In the fall of 1851, there were more than 190 families and 1,251 people in Sainte-Julie, according to the federal census.On July 1, 1885, the city obtained the right to legally elect, its first mayor, Jules Choquet.Sainte-Julie-de-Verchères, its full name, gained city status in 1971.In the mid-1960s, the construction of the Quebec Autoroute 20 further stimulated the development of Sainte-Julie, which became a rapidly developing suburb of Montreal.
