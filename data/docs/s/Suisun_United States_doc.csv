== History ==
Suisun City was established in the 1850s. Its location made it ideal for commerce and transportation during the California Gold Rush.
In 1868—1869, the First Transcontinental Railroad connected to downtown Suisun City via the California Pacific Railroad, expanding the region's reach across the United States.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Suisun City experienced rapid growth as the San Francisco Bay Area's suburban ring expanded to the formerly rural Solano County. Also in the 1960s, Interstate 80 was constructed two miles (3 km) outside the city, effectively moving commercial traffic away from railways and water conveyance.
