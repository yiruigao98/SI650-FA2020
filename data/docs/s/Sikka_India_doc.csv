A historical coastal port, mainly inhabited by seafarers and fishermen, became a town when it housed a cement factory in the 1940s. Digvijay Cement Company (also known as DCC) was set up, and Sikka became one of the prominent towns of the district. The factory brought along a railway connectivity and modernization of the port. People from nearby villages started moving to Sikka in search of a new world and started settling there, as years passed. 
Gujarat government also set up a thermal power plant here, due to its railway connectivity and a ready-made port. Reliance Industries houses its crude storage unit in the outskirts of Sikka; these storage units are clearly visible when the town is looked at, in Google Maps.
