Samborondón is one of the cantons of Guayas province in Ecuador. It has three parishes, two urban parishes, one called La Puntilla and the other called Town of Samborondón (Cabecera cantonal). There's another rural parish called Tarifa. La Puntilla's parish is one of the most exclusive residential and entertainment districts in Ecuador, boasting many Gated Communities (urbanizaciones cerradas) and several retail developments are located in the suburb. Its proximity to the country's second-largest city, Guayaquil (merely crossing a bridge), allows many of its residents to work there. Most of the upper-class families in Guayaquil live at La Puntilla's Parish in Samborondón.
Samborondón was founded on May 24, 1776 and achieve its independence on October 10, 1820. Since October 31, 1955 the suburb has been a canton. The canton has 105 localities and two urban parishes (La Puntilla) and Samborondón Town (Cabecera cantonal) and one rural parish (Tarifa).The name Samborondón comes from Saint Brendan, in Spanish San Borondón. The name of the Saint was commonly used in Spain and subsequently in Latin America for towns and villages.
The name Samborondón, in general usage, often refers to the rich downtown area of the canton called
La Puntilla. In fact, Samborondón consists of a much larger area than just La Puntilla, which is a peninsula between the rivers Babahoyo and Daule (where the River Guayas is formed).
La Puntilla is known as the home of many of the rich and powerful of Guayaquil, including banana tycoon and several-time presidential candidate Álvaro Noboa, Ecuador's richest man. But much the canton is in fact rural and poor, and most of its inhabitants live from the cultivation of rice. Nevertheless, the mayor (who himself lives in Guayaquil) has done a lot to improve their situation and his policies are intended to benefit poorer inhabitants of the canton, as well as the richer inhabitants. Several improvements have been made to the area recently.
