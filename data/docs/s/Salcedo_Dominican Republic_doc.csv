In the place where is now the city of Salcedo there was a very small town with the name of Juana Núñez. It was made a Puesto cantonal (an old category that now is called Municipal District) in 1880 as part of the old La Vega province.With the creation of the Espaillat province in 1885, Juana Núñez was made part of this new province. In 1891, its name was changed from Juana Núñez to the present one, Salcedo.
Salcedo was made a municipality in 1905 and, when the Salcedo Province (now Hermanas Mirabal Province) was created in 1952, the city became the head municipality of the new province.

Farming is the only economic activity in the municipality, except for some very small industries; the main products are plantain, cassava and cacao.

The city became wide known outside of the Dominican Republic due to the Youtube video with an unusual request from the listener of a local radio station to play a song with the words "Essos son Reebok o son Nike" (meaning actually "Are they Reebok or Nike?").
