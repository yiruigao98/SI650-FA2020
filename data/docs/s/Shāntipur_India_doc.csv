Since ancient times, Shantipur and the surrounding region has been famous for handloom saris (saree). The handloom weaving style unique to this region are famously known as Santipuri Sari (tant). After the partition of India, Bengal was split into two major regions.  West Bengal became a part of India and East Bengal became East Pakistan (Bangladesh).  Many skilled weavers from Dhaka, in current day Bangladesh, migrated into West Bengal and settled around the cities of Shantipur and Kalna (Ambika Kalna) of Bardhaman district.  Both are traditionally renowned centers for producing hand-woven fabrics sold throughout the country. Through government support for Indian handicrafts and arts, the weaving community slowly grew and thrived. Saris and finely woven feather-touch textiles are still being produced in the same traditional method today. One can find the patterns and colors found in ancient times still reflected in the garments produced in the vast textile belt of Shantipur, Phulia, Samudragarh, Dhatrigram and Ambika Kalna.  Each center produces superb fabrics in its own variation of the Shantipuri style of weaving. Shantipur is especially known for super-fine-weave dhotis and jacquards. These textiles are marketed through co-operatives and various commercial undertakings.Most of the people in the Sutragarh area of Shantipur are engaged in textile trade.

== Religious History ==
The old and historical town Shantipur is famous for Ras Utsav and "Dol utsav" which is thought to have begun by Mathuresh Goswami, the great grandson of Advaita Acharya who was one of the main associates of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

The principle deity of the town is 'Radharaman' in the family of Baro Gosai descending from the lineage of Mathuresh Goswami. The deity was originally installed as a single statue of krishna named 'dol govinda' in Orissa by king indradyumna. When the king of Yessore (now in Bangladesh), Pratapaditya attacked Orissa, the priest of the temple gave away the deity to his own guru Mathuresh Goswami to protect it in times of emergency. He brought the idol to his ancestral home in Shantipur where he reinstalled it in a new temple. A deity of Radha was later installed beside Dolgovinda and both of them renamed Radharaman.

The deity believed to be worshipped by Advaita Acharya himself is named Madan Gopal and is worshipped in the lineage of Krishna Mishra, the second son of Advaita Acharya.
On the day of Rashyatra, the main festival of the town, all of them are taken out in a grand procession around the city accompanied with drums, kirtan and other celebration. Curiously, all the thrones are lit with the age-old Belgium glass candleholders and chandeliers, instead of electric lighting, even to this day. This gives Rashotsav a very ancient and historical look. On this day, as a continuation of a tradition introduced by Bara Goswamis near about 250 years ago, a young girl, called Rai-Raja (Rai is another name for Radha and Raja means king), dressed in expensive attire and gold ornaments is seated in a throne and paraded across the city to be worshipped as Radha.
Kali Puja is another festival that the people of this place pays a lot of dedication .
There is a unique form of celebrating Kali worship in the form of hand painted image of the deity known as "Pateshwari" meaning drawing of the deity on a piece of cloth. The deity is worshiped for 3 days during the "Rash Utsav." The second day of worship is marked by the sacrifice of a goat. It is then incorporated into the many festive meals and shared with the community until the festival ends. The "Pateshwari Mandir" is one of the oldest temples in Shantipur, dating back to the 16th century, with such a painted canvas of Goddess Kali.okulchand(Madhyam Gosai),Madangopal,Shyamchand Mandir, Chakfera,Ataboney,Bansboney etc. '
