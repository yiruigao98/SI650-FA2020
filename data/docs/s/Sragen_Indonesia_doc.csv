The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was confirmed to have spread to Indonesia on 2 March 2020, after a dance instructor and her mother tested positive for the virus. Both were infected from a Japanese national.By 9 April, the pandemic had spread to all 34 provinces in the country. Jakarta, East Java, and West Java are the worst-hit provinces, together accounting almost 50% of the national total cases. The largest increase of new cases in a single day occurred on 8 October, when 4,850 cases were announced. At most 5,810 recoveries and 160 fatalities were ever recorded within a span of 24 hours. On 13 July, the recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.As of 17 October, Indonesia has reported 357,762 cases, the highest in Southeast Asia, ahead of the Philippines. In terms of death numbers, Indonesia ranks third in Asia and 16th in the world. Review of data, however, indicated that the number of deaths may be much higher than what has been reported as those who died with acute COVID-19 symptoms but had not been confirmed or tested were not counted in the official death figure.Indonesia has tested 
2,505,898
people against its 269 million population so far, or around 9,295 people per million. The World Health Organization has urged the nation to perform more tests, especially on suspected patients.Instead of implementing a nationwide lockdown, the government had approved large-scale social restrictions (Indonesian: Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar, abbreviated as PSBB) for some regencies and cities. Starting from late May, they began to apply new normal, along with another green and yellow zone regions. This policy received much criticism and is considered as a 'disaster' due to the still increasing number of cases.


== Statistics ==

At first, the government only published the numbers of actual people being tested. Since 15 April, the government changed the method of its counting, now also publishing the actual numbers of tested specimens, which is used on this chart. On 11 June, the government published the numbers of actual people being tested the next morning due to delay in reporting from several labs. Tested specimens reported on Mondays and day after public holidays are normally lower as most testing labs are closed on the day before.


== Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.


== Timeline ==

From January until February 2020, Indonesia reported zero cases of COVID-19, despite being surrounded by infected countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia. Flights from countries with high infection rate, including South Korea and Thailand, also continued to operate. Health experts and researchers at Harvard University in the United States expressed their concerns, saying that Indonesia is ill-prepared for an outbreak and there could be undetected COVID-19 cases.On 2 March 2020, Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced the first cases in the country: a dance instructor and her mother in Depok, West Java. Both of them had held a dance class at a restaurant in Kemang, South Jakarta on 14 February, which was attended by more than a dozen people. One of whom was a Japanese, who was later tested positive for the COVID-19 in Malaysia. As Malaysia reported the case, the government of Indonesia began to trace anyone who have had close contact with the Japanese and the infected Indonesians.The cluster was initially identified as the "Jakarta cluster" or the "dance class cluster", owing to the location of the infection. Since then, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia began to increase slowly. By 8 March, a total of 6 people who had attended the dance class were infected by the COVID-19, including one case of repatriated Indonesian from the Diamond Princess. Several COVID-19 cases in West Java and Jakarta were found to have a link with the cluster.The positive cases first confirmed in March are not the first Indonesians to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In January, an Indonesian maid in Singapore contracted the virus from her employer.The first confirmed death of COVID-19 in the country occurred on 11 March when a 53-year-old British citizen in Bali died. However, a Telkom employee who died on 3 March was found positive on 14 March.A newborn baby who died in Manado, North Sulawesi on 19 May was declared as the youngest COVID-19 patient and fatality in Indonesia. On 11 April, an 11-month-old infant died at Bahteramas Regional General Hospital, Kendari while still under Patient Under Supervision (PDP) status. On 30 May, a centenarian from Surabaya had recovered, making her the oldest person to recover from COVID-19 in the country.


== Classifications ==


=== Cases ===
Since 14 July 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia classifies people involved with COVID-19 into four levels:
A suspect is a person showing symptoms of respiratory infections, and has stayed within 14 days in any country or any region in Indonesia with local transmission and/or has established contact within 14 days with a confirmed or probable case and/or requires treatment at the hospital and has no possible diagnosis of other diseases.
A probable case is a person, alive or deceased, who shows or showed obvious signs of COVID-19 symptoms and awaiting results of his or her swab test.
A confirmed case is a person whose sample produced positive results based on swab or molecular rapid test. A confirmed case may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Due to lower accuracy and higher chance of false positives, a positive rapid or antibody test is not counted into the official number of cases.
A close contact is a person who established contact with a probable or confirmed case between 2 days before and 14 days after symptoms show up, or the date of testing for asymptomatic cases. He or she must be quarantined for 14 days. Reclassification into suspect may be done should he or she show symptoms.Other classifications include:

A recovered case is recorded after a confirmed case is discharged from isolation. For an asymptomatic case, it is 10 days after a sample testing; for a symptomatic case, it is after a swab test or 10 days after onset of symptoms, and at least 3 days after no fever or respiratory difficulties.
Deaths are a combination of both the number of deceased probable and confirmed cases.


=== Location ===
According to the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, a regency or municipality may be classified into three levels depending on the severity of COVID-19 cases within the region, according to these parameters:
The number of positive cases within 14 days
The number of suspected cases within 14 days
The number of deaths buried according to COVID-19 protocol within 14 days
Threat of disease contagions to healthcare workersEach has a score of 15 points for increasing trends, 20 for stationary trends, and 25 for decreasing trends.
The three levels will be assigned to a specific region:

Red Zone if the total score reaches below 80 points. Large-scale social restrictions may be enforced.
Yellow Zone if the total score reaches 80 to 95 points.
Green Zone if the total score reaches 100 points (all 4 parameters show a decreasing trend).


== Cases ==


=== Cases by province ===
Jakarta became the first province that confirmed COVID-19 cases, while Gorontalo was the last to do so. On 6 July, Jambi became the last province to report a death, 53 days after the penultimate province East Nusa Tenggara did. Jakarta set a record for most cases in a single day by a province with 1,398 cases, beating the previous record held by West Java with 962 cases. Java is currently the epicenter of the pandemic since it has more cases than all other regions combined. Furthermore, four most affected provinces are located on the island.

The Indonesian government persuaded other countries to bring Indonesians to their country, but the countries questioned on whether Indonesia is able to manage the outbreak and thus keep them safe. The Minister of Foreign Affairs Retno Marsudi telecommunicated with other countries to discuss it; some countries then decided to only unban very essential travel with travellers already conducted two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, in consideration of Indonesia's disrupted economy.


== Criticism ==


=== Failure to detect the virus ===
Health experts are concerned that the country is failing to identify the transmission of the virus. Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, "analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report ... that Indonesia might have missed cases" of coronavirus disease 2019. Western diplomats as well as local and international news outlets postulated that the lack of cases within Indonesia result from inadequate testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer luck and divine intervention.On 22 March, a research suggested that the official number of infections may only reflect 2% of the real COVID-19 infections in Indonesia. According to The Jakarta Post on 5 April 2020, the central government has only conducted a daily average of 240 PCR tests since 2 March.


=== Budget for foreign social media influencers ===
The government faced backlash after instead pledging to set aside IDR 72 billion ($5m) to pay for social media influencers to attract tourists to Indonesia.


=== Lack of transparency ===
Indonesian president Joko Widodo is also criticized by Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, human rights groups, and also by political party such as Golkar and PKS for lack of transparency regarding the information of the COVID-19. Widodo have insisted not to share the travel history details of the patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the general public. The public had asked the government to release official national map of COVID-19 confirmed cases' location, as unofficial independent maps may provide incorrect data.


=== Tests and treatment ===
Reports have surfaced about patients in Greater Jakarta having to wait for a long time to get tests or treatment for possible cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as referral hospitals face the increasing strain.


=== Lockdown policies ===
Joko Widodo has come under increased pressure to impose a partial lockdown on virus-plagued areas, with scientists saying the country is racing against time to curb the spread of COVID-19 before Eid al-Fitr and that a community quarantine could be the only solution to do exactly that. On 16 March, Jokowi said lockdown policies are the authority of the central government, and warned the local government to not impose lockdown without the consent of the central authority.On 27 March, dozens of Indonesian medical professors have called for "local lockdowns", saying that the government's policy of physical distancing is not "effective". The government is drafting a regulation (PP) to stipulate the procedures and requirements for imposing regional quarantines.


=== Censorship ===
Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic.


=== Additional death rates excluded from official counts ===
According to a report from Reuters, as of 28 April 2020, there were around 2,200 patients who had died with coronavirus symptoms, but not included into the official death toll of 693. This suggests that Indonesia has a higher death rate than the official counts. An analysis by Financial Times showed that there were 1,400 more deaths in Jakarta compared to the historical average number of deaths in March and April. This excess deaths figure is 15 times the official figure of 90 COVID-19 deaths in this same period.


=== Evasion of travel restrictions ===
"Ramadan exodus" contributed to the spread of the virus in Indonesia, despite government regulations on social distancing and despite a lockdown slated to run until June.Also, despite the travel restrictions which suspends all passengers to travel outside areas with at least one confirmed case, many Indonesians disregarded it and have attempted to evade the travel restrictions in order to return to hometown during Eid al-Fitr season. This has caused scientists to raise concern that this evasion will lead to the diseases which can spread easily from Jakarta and nearby satellite cities, where it is the epicenter of the pandemic, to other regions of Indonesia with weak medical facilities which are unable to handle large numbers of outbreak.There are also few attempts on evading the travel restrictions which had been discovered by the police department, such as one of the cargo trucks was stopped only to found out the intermodal container is hiding a car with passengers inside to be transported from Java to Sumatra, and additional four cargo trucks were also detained when the driver attempting to bring 20 passengers from Jakarta inside the containers which were covered with tarpaulin.


=== Lack of safety in tobacco industries ===
Despite the temporary closure of HM Sampoerna due to two workers dying from COVID-19, with additional 63 workers tested positive, Pandu Riono, the epidemiologist from University of Indonesia reported that other cigarette factories in East and West Java will continue to operate without practicing social distancing and workers never wearing face masks. This sparks concern that the cigarette factories could create new clusters for the coronavirus outbreak considering that this industry usually has large workforce.


== Impact ==


=== Socioeconomic ===
