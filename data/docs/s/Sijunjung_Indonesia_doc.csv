Sijunjung Regency, formerly known as Sawahlunto Sijunjung, is a regency (kabupaten) in West Sumatra, Indonesia. The regency seat is Muaro Sijunjung. The regency was created from the former Sawahlunto Regency, after the districts comprising Sawahlunto town became a city, administratively separated from the regency.
Most of the people work in trade or as government employees, and the rest are farmers. There are few university graduates, because most people are not interested in continuing their studies for reasons of economic and environment culture. Many of the natural resources of this regency are not explored and utilized because of the mountainous geography.
