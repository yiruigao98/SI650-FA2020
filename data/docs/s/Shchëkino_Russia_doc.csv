In the 6th season, the show underwent a major change. Firstly the name was changed to «Minute of Fame - Dreams Come True». At the end of each qualifying round the jury picks 1 act, not necessarily one who passed on to audience voting, and gives them a choice: either have their dream fulfilled, or be entered directly into the finals without requiring the audience to vote them there, meaning they still have a chance to win the 1,000,000 rubles prizel. Second, the participants were given mentors.

In the 7th season of the show on the new scenario, part of the participants' «Minute of Fame» now is not removed in the studio and outdoors.

By new rules it's for such numbers jury does not vote. Vote for them audience in the hall. In the semifinal get those participants for whom the vote of at least 15% of the audience in the studio. There is also no mentors, who had previously supported the contestants.

In this season in the chair member of the jury, along with the usual three judges in each issue necessarily representative of the sport was alone, as this is Olympic season. Also in the VIP-box in each issue were present different guests with their exclusive gifts that they in the end of the tour participant were presented to get noticed.
