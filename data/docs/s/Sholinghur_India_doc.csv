Sholinghur is a selection grade town panchayat under Sholinghur taluk in Ranipet District of Tamil Nadu, India. The town is  famous in Tamil Nadu and other neighboring states for the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple.


== Etymology ==
The first name for this  town was Thirukkadigai. This signifies its status as one of the 108 Divya Desams in Vaishnavism. The reason behind the name Thirukkadigai is due to one of the following myths.

It is believed by historians that sage Vishwamitra attained title by worshiping Narasimha there for around 45 minutes.
It is said in sculptures that saptha rishis had vision and blessings from Lord Narasimha for a duration of time, termed as 'Kadigai' (approximately 45 minutes) and hence the name 'Thirukkadigai'.
It is also believed that Indra, with his demigods, would take a bath in the pushkarni and pray to Narasimha. The name of pushkarni is 'Thakkan'.
The Pushkarni is believed by historians to have medicated water which cures all diseases.
Budha (son of Chandra) worshipped the deity there and was cured from the curse given by sage Durvasa.
Many mental disorders, evil acts and prolonged diseases of any kinds are believed to be cured when people take bath in the pushkarni and pay obeisance to the lords on the two hillocks.During the days of Cholas & Nawabs, the name Thirukkadigai was less used and the name Chozha Singapuram acquired prominence.
Reference is made to a ghatika in the Tiruvallam inscription of Nandivarman Pallavamalla dated in his 61st year.  Again an arbitrator having the title Trairjyua ghatika madhyasthan is mentioned in three inscriptions of Parthivendradhipathi from Brahmadesam in North Arcot District (Kanchipuram district) of Tamil Nadu  This ghatika was presumably a different one from the famous one at the Pallava capital Kanchipuram.  It was probably the Ghatikachala at the Sholinghur hill.  This place is referred to as Kadigai in the siriya thirumadal and periya thirumoli of Vaishnava saint Tirumangai Alvar, a contemporary of Nandivaraman Pallavamalla.  During the Pallava period it was a well-known centre of Sanskrit learning and stronghold of Vaisnavism.  The early Vaisnava saint Peyalvar refers to this temple as Pungatikai in his Iyarpa third Andadi. Pallava influences are traceable in the neighbourhood of this place.  A cave temple belonging to Mahendravarma I who reigned early in the seventh century is from Kanchipuram bearing the name Mahendravisnugrha is found in Mahendravadi.  It is not unlikely that a ghatika was founded there by the successors of Mahendravarman and the place was named Ghatikachalam.  In his hymns on the Tirukkannapuram on the hill of Ghatikai. The ghatika is Sholinghur hill consisted of Vaisnava Brahmans who carried on a programme of higher studies specially drawn up for the institution.  The institution presumably attracted its students from several places around Ghatikachalam. The ghatika was probably located the hill temple itself dedicated to Narasimha.  Sholinghur which a Kadigai was seat of Great learning in the later Pallava age continued to be an educational centre in subsequent days during the chola age.  Even to this day there is a Sanskrit College at this place.The current name of the town is a contraction of the words Chola-linga-puram, and was given to because a Chola king had found a natural lingam (suyambu) here, and built a temple over it, called the Sholeswara temple.  The temple is located in the middle of the town.According to legends, Lord Narasimha would not only take several reincarnations in this world to reform people, but also send his messengers as preceptors to perform this function. One such preceptor was Doddacharya of Chozha Lingapuram (சோழலிங்கபுறம்), who lived nearly 470 years ago, performing service to Lord Yoga Narasimhar.
Doddacharya used to visit Kanchipuram Varadharaja Perumal temple every year during Bhramotsavam. On one particular year, he fell sick and was not able to visit the Kanchipuram Temple. Sitting on the banks of present-day Thakkan kulam (Pushkarini) he prayed to God Varadharaja Perumal. Heeding to his prayers, God Varadharaja Perumal appeared in front of him for few seconds. At the same time, the Varadharaja Perumal idol disappeared in Kanchipuram. As a result of this incident, a temple dedicated to Varadharaja Perumal Temple was built on the banks of Thakkan kulam, next to Anjaneyer Temple in Sholinghur. This Varadharaja Perumal Temple at Sholinghur is open only during the Bhramotsavam Festival days in Kanchipuram. Even today during Bhramotsavam at Kanchipuram, the Varadharaja Perumal idol will be closed with a screen for few seconds and then opened to mark the disappearance of the idol and its appearance before Doddacharya at Sholinghur some 470 years ago.
The name Choza Lingapuram was later shortened to Sholinghapuram in common usage. During the late 20th Century, the name of the town was further shortened to Sholingur, which is currently the official name of the town.
