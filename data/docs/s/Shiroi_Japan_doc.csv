== History ==
Shiroi Village was created within Inba District, Chiba Prefecture on April 1, 1885 with the early Meiji period establishment of the municipalities system. From shortly after World War II until the early 1960s Shiroi was the site of a United States Air Force Base (ShiroiI AFB APO 73). Shiroi was elevated to town status on September 1, 1964. As the Japanese economy grew in the 1970s, many people moved from the country to the cities, and the growth of Tokyo sent many residents out to suburbs in the Kantō countryside. Shiroi's real growth began during this period: its rail connection to Chiba City was completed in 1979, and it was linked directly to the Tokyo railway network in 1991. Shiroi was elevated to city status on April 1, 2001


== Schools ==
There are nine elementary schools (Grade 1-6) in Shiroi: Shiroidaini Elementary School, Shiroidaiichi Elementary School, 
Nanatsugidai Elementary School, Ikenokami Elementary School, Shimizuguchi Elementary School, Minamiyama Elementary School, Shiroidaisan Elementary School, Oyamaguchi Elementary School, and Sakuradai Elementary School.

== Economy ==
Shiroi is a regional commercial center and a bedroom community for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. During the Meiji era, Shiroi became a fruit-growing area. Local farmers planted kiwifruit and grapes, but the most famous of Shiroi's fruits turned out to be nashi pears. In the springtime, the pear trees still bloom alongside the sakura.
