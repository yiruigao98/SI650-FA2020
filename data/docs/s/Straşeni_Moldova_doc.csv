Strășeni (Romanian pronunciation: [strəˈʃenʲ]) is a city and municipality of about 20,000 inhabitants in central Moldova, the administrative center of Strășeni District. The city administers one village, Făgureni.
There are several legends about its name. One tells that the name of the region is derived from strașnic, a Romanian adjective that can mean "scary", "terrible", and the story goes that in former times this region was covered by a fearsome forest.
Nowadays, Strășeni is famous for its wine. The Strășeni vineyard, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) west of Chișinău, is renowned for its sparkling white wines. A little farther north is the Romănești winery, one of the largest locally and the one-time leading producer of wines in the USSR. One of its more famous products is a Bordeaux-type red.
