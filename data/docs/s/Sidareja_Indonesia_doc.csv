Serayu Train is an economy-class train running twice a day between Purwokerto and Pasar Senen. The train was previously known as Sidareja, Cipuja, and Citrajaya. The name Serayu is derived from the Serayu River, which the train crosses twice on its journey.


== History ==
Initially called Sidareja at its inauguration in 1985, the morning train was later renamed to Cipuja, while its night train counterpart was named Citrajaya and the route was extended to Cilacap and Jakarta. The train Galuh called at stations on this route which were skipped by both Cipuja and Citrajaya. In the early 2000s, Cipuja and Citrajaya were rebranded to Serayu. In 2013, the route was extended to Purwokerto.


== Route ==
The Serayu train runs four times daily, twice per direction, following the route Purwokerto–Kroya–Maos–Kawunganten–Sidareja–Banjar–Ciamis–Tasikmalaya–Cipeundeuy–Kiaracondong–Cimahi–Purwakarta–Pasar Senen.
