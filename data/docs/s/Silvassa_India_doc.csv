Silvassa (Gujarati: સેલવાસ, Hindi: सिलवासा) is a city and municipality in western India. It is the headquarters of the Dadra and Nagar Haveli district of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, India.

The city was chosen as one of the hundred Indian cities in Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission. City is surrounded by beautiful & big gardens.  


== History ==
Until the end of the 19th century, Silvassa was only a small village. The growing importance of Silvassa started in 1885 when the Portuguese Administration decided to transfer the seat of Nagar Haveli to the city, which until then had been in Darará. By decree of 11 February 1885, Silvassa was created as a town, with the name of Vila de Paço d'Arcos. However, the original name prevailed and the town continued to be mainly known as Silvassa and referred to as such in official documents.


== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 India census, Silvassa had a population of 98,265.


== Language ==
Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi are the commonly spoken languages. Since the city lies in the northern part of Nagar Haveli, Gujarati language and its dialects are widely spoken as compared to the southern part of Nagar Haveli where Marathi, Konkani and its dialects hold prominence. Silvassa, being a cosmopolitan, is home to people from every part of India and hence every Indian language is spoken here such as Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bhojpuri, Odia, Malayalam, Bengali, Kannada, Marwadi etc. A former Portuguese colony, Silvassa has a significant Roman Catholic population. There are still a few people who speak Portuguese as their first language.
