Sarakhs (Persian: Saraxs‎, also Romanized as Serakhs) is a city in Sarakhs County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.  Sarakhs was once a stopping point along the Silk Road, and in its 11th century heyday had many libraries.  Much of the original city site is now just across the border at Serakhs in Turkmenistan.  According to the most recent national census, in 2006, the city's population was 33,571 in 8,066 families.


== History ==

Several battles were fought in this area. According to Ferdowsi's Shahnameh the town has existed since the Afrasiab period and was named for its builder, Sarakhs, son of Godarz, by Keykavus.  Turkmen historians consider the city to have been founded over 2500 years ago. The Mongols plundered and destroyed Sarakhs in 617. It was rebuilt in the mid-19th century by the order of Nasser-al-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty.  The city was also attacked by the Turkmens.


== Geography ==
Sarakhs weather is cold in winter, warm and dry in summer thanks to the influence of the Karakum Desert.


== Landmarks ==
The main historical site of Sarakhs is the partly restored Loghman Baba mausoleum in a field just north of the town.  It was built in 1356AD (757AH).
In Sarakhs district within 80 km of Sarakhs town are:

Mazdavand cave and reservoir
Iran–Turkmenistan Friendship Dam
Ribat Sharaf Caravanserai

== Transport ==
More than a century after the early proposals of a cross-border railway at this location,
the railways of Iran and Turkmenistan were finally linked here in 1996. A bogie exchange is needed to overcome a break of gauge.  This will be supplemented with a quicker SUW 2000 variable gauge axles track gauge changing facility (TSR).
