== History ==

The Counts of Nellenburg founded Stockach in the 13th century, the town receiving town privileges in 1283. In 1401 to the Landgraviate of Nellenburg owned the towns of Engen, Tengen, Radolfzell, Stockach, 125 villages, 9 abbeys and 4 mailing stations.
The Counts of Nellenburg became extinct in 1422 and their estates were acquired by the House of Habsburg in 1465; hence Stockach was a part of Further Austria until 1805. In the Swabian War of 1499 the troops of the Three Leagues besieged the town but failed to capture it.
During the War of the Spanish Succession, Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria set fire to Stockach. During the French Revolutionary Wars of the Second Coalition two battles were fought here between the French First Republic and the Habsburg Monarchy in 1799 and 1800. In 1810 Stockach finally fell to the Grand Duchy of Baden.
