Malegaon is a city and a municipal corporation in Nashik District in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Malegaon is known as the Textile Hub of Maharashtra. Malegaon is the second largest city of Nashik district after Nashik city and one of the largest cities in North Maharashtra.


== History ==
Malegaon (previously Maligaon) at the confluence of the Mausam (previously Moosy) and Girna rivers.
On the road linking Mumbai and Agra – now national highway No 3, NH3 – it used to be a small junction known as Maliwadi (hamlet of gardens). It quickly gained the reputation for being a source of employment in 1740 when a local jahagirdar, Naro Shankar Raje Bahadur, started building a fort in the area. As the fort took 25 years, a sizeable number of Muslim workers and artisans from places like Surat and northern India settled in the area.After the British capture of the Malegaon fort in 1818, Muslims from Hyderabad migrated to the region. The 1857 revolt saw many Muslims from the north move here, and the pattern repeated over the years. Malegaon, with its growing Muslim presence, became something of a shelter and a source of employment for the community whenever it faced reversals. If famine in 1862 forced Muslim weavers in the Varanasi area to move to Malegaon, the political upheavals in the Hyderabad of the late 1940s and 1950s saw a similar exodus to the town. Communal riots, especially from the 1960s onward, have undoubtedly contributed to swelling the number of Muslim migrants to Malegaon.

=== Industry ===
Malegaon is a major hub for cloth weaving using early 20th century power looms. The era of power looms in the city emerged after 1935. Malegaon was a traditional handloom-weaving centre in Maharashtra. Most of the preparatory work before weaving like starching the yarn, transferring it over the tubes, and preparing tanabana was done by the women. Even after power looms were introduced, women continued to help men in the weaving procedure.With the introduction of power looms, the cloth industry in Malegaon flourished due to increased productivity. Many people bought power looms and very few were left with handlooms. It has an estimated 3 lakh power looms producing about 1 crore (10 million) meters of cloth every day. It attracts workers from around India, majority of migrants from U.P., Khandesh and Deccan, due to lower cost of living and Muslim dominance.In recent times, the power loom industry is going through difficult phase due to factors like fluctuating government policies, frequent electricity outage, lack of political will, middleman at every stage and reluctance to migrate to advanced machines. Though it is still a major source of employment, most of workers struggle to make a living. As a result, the city has observed a change in migration pattern wherein the worker prefer to move to metros compared to Malegaon for better and stable job opportunities.
Malegaon of late has been diversifying and new industries are rapidly expanding. PVC pipe manufacturing is one such industry. Malegaon is soon becoming a regional centre for PVC pipes.


=== Mollywood film industry ===
Malegaon's notoriously wacky film spoof industry has introduced many classic Hollywood and Bollywood characters to the satellite town of Malegaon by giving them its quintessential dialogue, looks, circumstances, and food. After having conquered local imagination with such cult spoofs as Malegaon ki Sholay, Malegaon ke Karan arjun, Malegaon ka James Bond and Supermen of Malegaon, the impoverished film-maker invaded national television with his second version of Malegaon Ka Chintu, Chintu ban gaya Gentleman, a mute comedy based loosely on Mr. Bean.
A crew named Sky View Pictures in Malegaon produce and make movies. They have made several short films like Dillage, Caller Tunes, The Lost Lover, and Independence. The crew is currently working on their next feature film.Mollywood artists work on daily wages. They earn a livelihood selling vegetables, working in the textile factories in Malegaon, or running eateries or tea stalls. In the credits their names reflect their professions, like Salim Electrician, Iqbal Chaiwala, badshah khan, or Zaheer Cyclewala. Since Mollywood films are not released all over India, they don't make much money. The urge to make the movies is almost always personal passion. Malegoan Ke Karan Arjun, for example, was made on a budget of Rs 50,000 and made around Rs 2.50 lakh.
In the early days of Mollywood, local actors from Malegaon were excited to work in film with no fees. Later it was a trend that actors were not paid for the work. Owner of "ADD Films" production Atul Dusane was the first in Malegaon who started to pay actors, crew, and cast. Since then actors are being paid for the work.The male actors are locals, Some of the biggest stars, such as superstar Sarthak Nagpal, Jainya, Shafique Chotu, Badshah Khan, Ramzan Shahrukh. but Malegaon's conservative society does not allow local women to act in films, so actresses are mostly from Jalgaon.


=== Agriculture ===

== Bomb blast ==

On 29 September 2008, three bombs exploded in the States of Gujarat and Maharashtra killing eight people and injuring 80. During the investigation in Maharashtra, a Hindu group was framed and alleged to have been involved in the blasts. Three of the arrested suspects were identified as Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, Shiv Narayan Gopal Singh Kalsanghra, and Shyam Bhawarlal Sahu. All three were produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court in Nashik, which remanded them to custody till 3 November. On 28 October, the Shiv Sena, came out in support of the accused saying that the arrests were political in nature., the sectarian Hindutvadi Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray, propounded a potential conflict of interest in political rivalry as the secular Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) controlled the relevant ministry. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has found evidence against Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur and it has recommended the court to act against all charges against her which was proven incorrect.The Indian Army officer Prasad Shrikant Purohit was also Falsely accused of being involved in the blast. His counsel alleged that he was being falsely framed for political reasons because he has intelligence data of a sensitive nature pertaining to the operations of Sanathan sanstha, and bajrang Dal which could embarrass some quarters . He was sent on bail by the Supreme Court after nine years of trial on 21 August 21, 2017.
