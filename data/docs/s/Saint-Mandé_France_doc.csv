Saint-Mandé (French: [sɛ̃.mɑ̃.de]) is a high-end commune of the Val-de-Marne department in Île-de-France in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 5.3 km (3.3 mi) from the center of Paris. It is one of the smallest communes of the Île-de-France by land area, but is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. It is located on the edge of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, near the Porte de Vincennes and the Porte de Saint-Mandé.
The motto of the city is Cresco et Floresco, which means "I grow and I flourish".


== History ==
On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, about two-thirds of the commune of Saint-Mandé was annexed to Paris, and now forms the neighborhoods of Bel-Air and Picpus, in the 12th arrondissement of Paris.
In 1929, the commune of Saint-Mandé lost one-quarter of its territory when the city of Paris annexed the Bois de Vincennes, a small part of which belonged to Saint-Mandé, leaving Saint-Mandé as a small rump commune after the territorial losses of 1860 and 1929.
