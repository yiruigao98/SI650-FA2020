Saidpur (Syedpur) (bn:সৈয়দপুর Saiyadpur) is a city of Nilphamari district in Rangpur Division of Bangladesh. The city has become a very important communication hub for adjoining major district headquarters. Saidpur Airport is one of the domestic airports in Bangladesh. The Saidpur Railway Workshop, established in 1870, is the largest in Bangladesh and was the major railway workshop for Assam-Bengal railway. The city has historically been an Urdu-speaking community with close ties to Bihar, from which many residents originate, particularly the town of Munger. Since Bangladeshi independence, Urdu has declined as the Bihari community either integrated into Bangladeshi society, adopting Bengali as a Lingua franca, or a few who migrated to India or Pakistan.


== History ==
The city of Saidpur was established around the Saidpur Railway Workshop, established in 1870 by the British Colonial regime. Nothing is known about the origin of the upazila's name. It is learned that in the long past there came a Sayed family from Koch Bihar of India and settled in this area and started preaching Islam. It is generally believed that the Upazila might have derived its name, Saidpur, from the name of that Sayed family. Saidpur became Thana in 1915.

== Language ==
Most of the city dwellers use standard Urdu-Hindi as their mother tongue which is noticeable and influential in this city of Bangladesh, even the local Bengali people are fluent in speaking Hindi-Urdu. The language dialect of the region is slightly different from the modern standard Urdu or Hindi language trending toward Bihari languages. In some traditional wedding costumes, women sing folk songs in Bihari languages particularly in  Bhojpuri, Magahi, Awadhi and Maithili. Bihari Hindu people in Saidpur use mostly Bhojpuri among themselves. The Hindustani languages have not lost its full importance since the city had been remained untouched during the liberation war of Bangladesh and did not faced discriminations afterward. You can notice the use of Urdu in market, local announcements, Urdu musaharati Na'at during ramadan sehri and Mushaira programs. However, these Hindustani languages are not constitutionally recognised official languages in Bangladesh as for other Indigenous peoples in Bangladesh. Therefore, the official and academic language of the city is Modern Standard Bengali that serves as the lingua franca of the nation, with 98% of Bangladeshis being fluent in Bengali as their first language.
