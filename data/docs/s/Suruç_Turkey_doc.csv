Suruç (pronounced [ˈsuɾutʃ], Kurdish: Pirsûs, Syriac: ܣܪܘܓ‎ Sruḡ) is a rural district and city of Şanlıurfa Province of Turkey. It lies on a plain in the south of Turkish Kurdistan, near the Syria-Turkey border, 46 kilometres (29 mi) south-west of the city of Urfa.


== History ==
In antiquity the Sumerians built a settlement in the area. The city was a centre of silk-making. They were succeeded by a number of other Mesopotamian civilisations.
The Roman Emperor Constantine I brought the town under the control of the city of Edessa (modern-day Şanlıurfa). One of the most famous residents of the district is its 6th-century Syriac bishop and poet-theologian Jacob of Serugh. The Roman Catholic Church hold the bishopric as a titular see of that church, though they had little presence in the area, while the Syriac church holds a separate Bishopric in the town.
Tell-Batnan was visited by emperor Julian on his march from Antioch to the Euphrates in 363.The town was surrendered to the Rashidun Arabs in 639. It was later controlled by Crusaders (in 1098), and Muslims again (in 1127).
The city was then destroyed in the Mongol invasions, and in 1517 the area was brought into the Ottoman Empire by Selim I.
Suruç was occupied in 1918 by British and in 1919 by French troops, but was freed by a local resistance struggle. Today, Suruç is inhabited mostly by ethnic Kurds.

== Ecclesiastical history of Batnae ==
Batnae (or Batnæ) was important enough in the Roman province of Osroene to become a suffragan bishopric of its capital Edessa's Metropolitan, yet was to fade. The most famous Bishop of the city was Jacob of Serugh – The great Syriac Christian hymnographer born around 451 at Kurtam on the Euphrates and educated at Edessa becoming a priest at Hawra in the Serugh district, as a wandering pastor of several villages. At the age of 67 he was made bishop of Batnan, where he died around 521. Jacob avoided the theological controversies of his age, and is claimed with equal eagerness by Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian Christians as one of their own. He wrote several Hymns, 760 homilies and the Syriac translation of Evagrius.Another Bishop was Abraham of Batnae a contemporary of Basil of Caesarea. fl373
The bishopric would be nominally restored in two different titular bishoprics, for different Catholic rite-specific particular churches.
