Tamba-Sasayama (丹波篠山市, Tanba-Sasayama-shi), formerly known as Sasayama (篠山市, Sasayama-shi), is a city in the central eastern part of Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan.
The modern city of Tamba-Sasayama was established on April 1, 1999, from the merger of the former town of Sasayama, absorbing the towns of Konda, Nishiki and Tannan (all from Taki District).
As of April 30, 2017, the city had an estimated population of 42,395, with 17,161 households, and a population density of 110 persons per km². The total land area is 377.61 km².
On November 18, 2018, the city held a successful referendum on changing its name from Sasayama to Tamba-Sasayama in reference to the historical Tanba Province, which still has some influence on local branding and politics. The referendum about changing a municipality's name is the first of its kind in Japan, and the new name officially came into effect in May 2019.
