Somerset is a home rule-class city in Pulaski County, Kentucky, United States. The city population  was 11,196 according to the 2010 census. It is the seat of Pulaski County.


== History ==
Somerset was first settled in 1798 by Thomas Hansford and received its name from Somerset County, New Jersey, where some of the early settlers had formerly lived. Somerset became the Pulaski County seat in 1802, and it was incorporated as a city in 1887. A significant Civil War battle was fought in January 1862, at Mill Springs (now "Nancy") about 8 miles (13 km) west of Somerset, and a museum is at the site. A smaller battle was fought nearby at Dutton's Hill in 1863. In 1875 tracks for the Southern Railroad were completed and Somerset saw a sudden population growth and an increase in industry. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, library services were provided by the pack horse library. The completion of Lake Cumberland in 1950 transformed Somerset from a sleepy rural community into one of the largest recreation centers in Kentucky, drawing more than 1.7 million visitors annually, especially between the Memorial and Labor Day holidays.


== Geography ==
Somerset is located at 37°4′59″N 84°36′34″W (37.082966, −84.609387), and the downtown (central) part of the city is at an elevation of 974 feet above sea level. The city is located at the eastern end of Kentucky's Mississippian Plateau (or Pennyroyal Plateau); however, the micropolitan area extends eastward into the Appalachian Plateau (or Eastern Kentucky Coalfield), and northward to Kentucky's Outer Bluegrass region. Thus, the area shows significant variations in landforms and scenery.
Nearby Lake Cumberland is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world (101 miles in length, with an average depth of 85 feet (26 m) and a normal pool containing more than 2 trillion gallons of water). Somerset is also near Cumberland Falls and the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area; its tourism industries are, in part, due to its scenic and varied landscape.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.3 square miles (29 km2), of which 11.3 square miles (29 km2) is land and 0.09% is water.

== Demographics ==
The major demographic differences between the city and the micropolitan area relate to income, housing composition and age.  The micropolitan area, as compared to the incorporated city, is more suburban in flavor and has a significantly younger housing stock, a higher income, and contains most of the area's school age population.  Over the last 20 years, significant housing growth has occurred along the Fishing Creek tributary of Lake Cumberland, which lies just to the west of the City of Somerset, and along the main body of Lake Cumberland between the City of Burnside and Fishing Creek.  Much of the Somerset area housing growth in the last 20 years is decidedly lake-oriented.
As of the census of 2000, there were 11,352 people, 4,831 households, and 2,845 families residing within the City of Somerset (proper). The population density for the city proper was 1,007.1 persons per square mile (388.9/km2). A large karst valley occupies the south-central portion of the city, taking up about 25% of the land area; this valley is quasi-industrialized and also contains parks and recreational facilities; most of the population lies to the east and north of this valley in fairly compact and well-kept residential neighborhoods that have a real population density of about 1,800 persons per square mile.  There were 5,428 housing units at an average density of 481.5 per square mile (186.0/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 94.16% White, 3.66% Black, 0.18% Native American, 0.71% Asian, 0.26% from other races, and 1.02% from two or more races.

== Economy ==
Tourism is important to Somerset, due to its proximity to Lake Cumberland and other events. Lake Cumberland alone generates approximately $150 million in revenue each year, though the industry has been greatly impacted in recent years by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' work on the Wolf Creek Dam.  Since 2007, Lake Cumberland has been at low levels to facilitate the Corps work. . The city holds the annual Master Musicians Festival. The Civil War Battle of Mill Springs took place in nearby Nancy and the reenactments held there often draw large crowds. In November 2006, the Mill Springs Battlefield Visitor Center and Museum opened.  Their efforts focus on the preservation of the battlefield while providing educational resources to visitors.
Commerce, driven in part by the area's tourism, thrives in Somerset. The city is home to a small mall and several shopping centers. Most of these stores, as well as many restaurants and hotels are located along U.S. Route 27, making up the state's longest stretch of businesses outside of Louisville and Lexington.Begun in 2001, Somernites Cruise is a monthly classic car show held the fourth weekend of the months April through October. It has now become one of the largest monthly classic car events in the southeastern United States averaging over 1,100 cars each month. As a result of this event, the Kentucky State Legislature has named Somerset as "The Car Cruise Capital of Kentucky."
Somerset has also increasingly been taking on the functions of a major medical center. In 2006, a new 58-acre (230,000 m2) medical park, called MedPark West, was finished near the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital (LCRH). Since completion, several new medical practices have opened there. LCRH is one of the largest in the state and is surrounded by many doctors' offices and pharmacies. LCRH is regional hub for the region's only advanced medical services. LCRH is a JCAHO-accredited hospital with 304 beds. A virtual online tour of the hospital is available. An advanced ventilator care facility, Rockcastle Regional Hospital and Respiratory Care Center, is in adjoining Rockcastle County.
On June 26, 2012 Somerset city voters approved the sale of alcoholic beverages by a margin of 2167 "Wet" votes to 1464 "Dry" votes. This vote will allow for packaged liquor and beer sales and sales by the drink at restaurants and bars.In 2014, a municipal-run filling station, the Somerset Fuel Center, was opened in response to persistently high local gas prices. "The price of gas will be based on an average regional price and will include a small markup to cover costs, the mayor said." In addition to serving local residents, it is hoped the station will help encourage visits to nearby Lake Cumberland for fishing and boating.Nearby Somerset, located off Highway 461, is the Valley Oak Technology Complex, a key industrial center in the region. Housed there are such companies as SafeAuto, Blackboard Student Services and others. Somerset's location along Lake Cumberland has caused it to become a major houseboat manufacturing center. The city also has auto-associated, flooring, wood-associated, and other industries.
