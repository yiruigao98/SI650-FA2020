Sheridan is a city in the U.S. state of Wyoming and the county seat of Sheridan County. The city is located halfway between Yellowstone Park and Mount Rushmore by U.S. Route 14 and 16. It is the principal city of the Sheridan, Wyoming, Micropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of Sheridan County. The 2010 census put the city's population at 17,444 and the Sheridan, Wyoming, Micropolitan Statistical Area at 29,116, making it the 424th-most populous micropolitan area in the United States.


== History ==
The city was named after General Philip Sheridan, Union cavalry leader in the American Civil War.
Several battles between US Cavalry and the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Shoshone, and Crow Indian tribes occurred in the area in the 1860s and 1870s before the town was built.
In 1878, trapper George Mandel built a cabin on Big Goose Creek, reconstructed today in the Whitney Commons park near the Sheridan County Fulmer Public Library. Jack Dow surveyed the townsite for Sheridan in 1882, at the behest of John Loucks, first mayor of the town who had served under Gen. Sheridan.In the early 1880s, the nearby town of Big Horn was larger in population. In 1888, Sheridan County split off of Johnson County, and voters chose Sheridan as the county seat in a run-off election. The arrival of the Burlington and Missouri Railroad in 1892 boosted Sheridan's economic status, leading to the construction of the Sheridan Inn, where Buffalo Bill Cody was once a financial partner. Railroad maintenance facilities and railroad-tie treatment plants were significant employers in Sheridan's first decades. The railroad created numerous side industries as well as export opportunities for raw materials. Maps of the day show Sheridan as part of the "hinterland" providing raw goods to cities like Chicago. For the next twenty years the economy and population boomed.Numerous coal mines funded by Chicago investors opened along Tongue River north of Sheridan in the 1890s, sparking immigration, and a major building boom that built Sheridan's brick downtown district. By 1910, an electric streetcar line, one of the only in the state, connected the mining towns of Monarch, Dietz, and Acme to Sheridan.Sheridan was initially settled by farmers from midwestern states like Illinois, and a few people who came up the cattle trails from Texas, like John B. Kendrick, who went on to be a cattle tycoon and Governor of Wyoming. Many immigrants from Poland, Italy, Greece, Germany, Mexico, and Japan settled in Sheridan, finding work in coal mines, railroad, or agriculture. One notable Muslim immigrant was Zarif "Louie" Kahn, a charismatic Afghani tamale and hamburger vendor from what is now Pakistan whose neighborly generosity is still remembered in Sheridan. Many Polish families came from the Jaworzynka village in southern Poland.Agriculture played a major role in Sheridan County's early economy. By the 1920s, Sheridan was an agricultural processing center for wheat, dairy, and sugar beets, with a stockyard for cattle shipping by rail. Many hobos rode the rails to Sheridan in the 1920s and 1930s, seeking employment in agriculture and ranches.The role of underground coal mining declined in the 1950s when demand for coal to power steam locomotives declined due to adoption of diesel locomotives. As coal mine towns dwindled, many employees moved into Sheridan and found other lines of work. The economy boomed in the 1970s with the construction of strip mines along Tongue River in Montana. Many subdivisions were built on former small farms outside of Sheridan in the 1970s and 1980s as the dairy, wheat, and sugar beet industry consolidated to other areas in Montana and South Dakota with more production capacity.Tourism has long been a significant factor in Sheridan's economy and community life. Numerous guest ranches including Eaton's Ranch hosted guests that arrived by rail. Books like Diary of a Dude Wrangler and Hell Among the Yearlings document this history. Many dude ranch guests moved to Sheridan permanently, leaving a lasting influence on the area's economy, cultural life, and charity institutions. Today Sheridan has a number of local educational and community foundations, and almost 400 non-profits. Notable community-funded entities include a large Y.M.C.A. recreation center, and the WYO Theater.
In the 21st century, Sheridan is the economic center for a large area spanning three counties in north-central Wyoming and southern Montana. The town has a relatively diversified service economy — including government, healthcare, education, real estate, mining, and financial services, with a growing manufacturing sector — in contrast to many communities in Wyoming that rely mostly on natural resource extraction, government jobs, or national park tourism.


== Rodeo Culture and Cowboy/American Indian Influences ==
Sheridan has a strong rodeo culture that draws from ranching history as well as a tradition of catering to the wild-west entertainment and shopping tastes of locals and tourists. The Sheridan WYO Rodeo was established in 1932 following the success of other rodeos like the Bots Sots Stampede and the PK Ranch Rodeo of 1928. These summer events often drew participants and spectators from the nearby Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations, leading to the slogan "Cowboy Days and Indian Nights."
In 1953, the Miss Indian America Pageant and All-American Indian Days, "an interracial project in human relations," was founded to celebrate American Indian culture.The mix of cowboy and American Indian pageantry is still a major flavor in Sheridan's annual summer celebrations, akin to rodeos in other reservation-border towns like Pendleton, Oregon. Sheridan's milieu of cowboy-Indian cross-pollination and community relations provided part of the inspiration for the Walt Longmire mystery novel and TV series created by local author Craig Johnson.
Though Sheridan primarily celebrates its western culture through rodeo, the town's history and culture includes major industrial, commercial, and recreational influences.

== Representation in media ==
In 1984, Queen Elizabeth II visited Sheridan and stayed at Canyon Ranch as a guest of Wyoming U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop, the brother of lifetime friend Lady Porchester whose husband, George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon, was the queen's godson. It remained rather unpublicized before local reports of the Queen shopping at local stores caused international media outlets to hound the area, seeking to capture the obscure idea of British monarchy gathering at a ranch in the 'Old West' nestled beneath the Rocky Mountains. Coverage drastically intensified the following day with the Brighton hotel bombing, a nearly successful assassination attempt on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and reports of the Queen's impromptu call with President Ronald Reagan to discuss the matter.Several scenes of the 2006 film Flicka were filmed on location in Sheridan. It was based on the novel, My Friend Flicka.
Movies filmed in Sheridan include Into the Homeland, Wild Horses and Endangered Species.
In 1986, MTV hosted the world premiere of Prince's movie Under The Cherry Moon in the city.

Sheridan was ranked number one by the True West Magazine in 2006 among the Top Western Towns.  It was ranked sixth in 2007. It is a vacation destination and a travel stop, due to its proximity to Interstate 90 and U.S. Route 14.
Top Sheridan area destinations include The Brinton Museum in Big Horn, Wyoming, which exhibits iconic 19th, 20th and 21st century Western and American Indian art in the new 25,000 square-foot Forrest E. Mars, Jr. building and in its historic ranch house on the 620-acre Quarter Circle A Ranch. The museum was established in 1961 by Bradford Brinton's sister Helen Brinton, who wanted to make his historic collection of art available to the public. Exhibits include pieces by Charles M. Russell, Frederic Remington, Edward Borein, Winold Reiss, Thomas Moran, and Hans Kleiber, among many others. The Brinton Museum draws visitors from all 50 states and more than 30 foreign countries annually.
Another top destination is The Sheridan WYO Rodeo, which began in 1931 and is widely regarded as one of the top rodeos in the nation. It draws 25,000 guests to its annual, weeklong western celebration and performance each July at the Sheridan County Fairgrounds. The Sheridan WYO Rodeo recently launched a new Labor Day Weekend destination event called the Cowboy State Elite Rodeo, the only ERA League of Champions Rodeo event in an outdoor arena in the U.S.
Additionally, in 2009, Sheridan appeared on Newsmax magazine's list of the "Top 25 Most Uniquely American Cities and Towns," a piece written by current CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg. In the cover story, Greenberg called Sheridan "the real deal" and praised it for preserving "its rich American history."Ten sites in and near Sheridan are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including:

Trail End State Historic Site - 400 Clarendon Avenue - A mansion finished in 1913 that was the home of John Benjamin Kendrick (1857–1933).
