San Benedetto del Tronto is a city and comune in Marche, Italy. Part of an urban area with 100,000 inhabitants, it is one of the most densely populated areas along the Adriatic Sea coast. Its port is one of the biggest on the Adriatic; it is the most important centre of Riviera of the Palms, with over 8,000 Phoenix canariensis, Washingtonia and P. sylvestris plants.


== History ==

San Benedetto del Tronto was a martyr and a soldier born in Cupra during the reign of Roman Emperor Diocletian. Shortly thereafter, following the edict of Constantine in 313 AD, some believers built a chapel around the tomb. Since then, San Benedetto has been highly revered by locals. He later built a small church which included an apse facing the east and its entrance facing the west, in accordance with the early Christian tradition that the east, where the sun rises, and the sunrise is symbolic of Christ's resurrection. Historians argue that archaeological findings indicate Roman origins, linking San Benedetto to the ancient city of Alba Picena on the right bank of the Albula river.
The first document which indicated the name of the village dates from 998. The document was an act concerning the investiture of the benefice of SS. Vincent and Anastasius in the territory of Acquaviva Piceno by Hubert bishop of Fermo. The document contains the phrase "Pede sive terra et silva Sancti Benedicti", referring to the city. In 1211, Emperor Otto IV granted the territories ranging from the Tronto River to the Potenza river to the town of Fermo. In 1245, Emperor Frederick II granted Ascoli Piceno a stretch of coast between the Ragnola river and Tronto river to build a fortified port. In the following years, there were disputes between Ascoli and Fermo. In 1478, there was a plague epidemic which decimated the city's population. The area remained virtually uninhabited until refugees from Romagna repopulated San Benedetto where they were granted land leases. From the 16th century until the 19th century, the Turks repeatedly invaded the city where they captured sailors and forced them into slavery. Since 1650, the urban center expanded beyond the city walls. In 1754, the first marine suburbs, Sant'Antonio da Padova and Marina, were created. In 1860, the "Cacciatori delle Alpi" freed the city from the dominion of the church. The Royal Decree giving San Benedetto the "del Tronto" attribute was in 1896. In 1936, the village of Porto d'Ascoli was absorbed into the city of San Benedetto del Tronto.
During Second World War, the city suffered 144 air raids and 6 naval bombardments. Following the end of the war, the city's economy and businesses prospered. Fishing became a cornerstone of the local economy and in the 1960s and 1970s, the city became one of the largest national fishing ports. After the war, San Benedetto became a tourist destination on the Adriatic coast.


== Geography ==

The city has an ancient nucleus (the "high country" or " su dèntrë " in Sambenedettese) on a modest relief not far from the sea, at the foot of which develops the original settlement of the most recent part "  Navy  '. This is crossed by the Albula torrent and has developed over the years up to the river Tronto, to the south, incorporating the locality Porto d'Ascoli, while at north it joins with the Ischia district of Grottammare, with which it constitutes a single urban agglomeration that reaches almost until Tesino.

=== Monument to the fisherman ===
This statue is located at the point where the waterfront joins the southern dock of the harbor basin and reproduces the fishermen's estate during storms, when, to draw attention to the danger deriving from the looming fog over the sea, they used the trumpet. It is the work of Cleto Capponi, a Grottammarese artist.


=== The Jonathan seagull monument ===

Created by the artist Mario Lupo in 1986, the monument to the seagull Jonathan Livingston Seagull, protagonist of the book by Richard Bach, rises along the southern pier promenade, the one that was renamed The Jonathan's way. The work, projected for 10 meters, encloses the life of seagulls and water in a blue circle. It is the symbol of the generous industriousness and tenacity typical of seafarers, people used to face and overcome obstacles and difficulties silently.


=== Museum of the Sea Museum ===
The "Polo del Mare" museum complex is composed of five sections: the "Augusto Capriotti" Fish Museum, the Amphora Museum, the Marche Marine Civilization Museum, the Truentinum Antiquarium and the Sea Picture Gallery. The first four are located in the Wholesale Fish Market area. The Pinacoteca del Mare instead is located inside the Palazzo Piacentini.


==== "Augusto Capriotti" Fish Museum ====
It is among the most important museums in the Piceno area. Named after the distinguished Sambenedese scientist Augusto Capriotti, inaugurated in 1956 it now includes over 9,000 specimens divided into: fish, crustaceans, molluscs, cetacea, echinoderms, coelenterates and fossils. Also interesting is the library containing more than 1,000 volumes including rare texts of historical and scientific value.


==== Museum of Amphorae ====
Housed near the port, it represents a unique collection of amphoras of disparate ages (Canaanite, Phoenician, Punics, Greek, Roman and Byzantine) collected throughout the Mediterranean from the Sambenedetti fishing boats that they practiced bottom trawling, a technique that had not been permitted for years, which made it possible to recover these lost finds from past civilizations.


==== Museo d'Arte sul Mare (MAM) ====
The Museo d'Arte sul Mare (MAM) is a permanent open-air museum that stretches over 1,150 meters along the 'Molo sud' (walkway) (called  Jonathan's street ). It contains 189 artworks, of which 165 are sculptures made on the faces of the breakwater blocks of travertine lined up along the walk and 24 murals. The artworks have been created over the years by 164 sculptors and wall painters coming from 37 nations of five continents, guests of the International Art Symposium " Festival dell'Arte sul Mare" .


=== The course ===

The historic Viale Secondo Moretti, built at the beginning of the thirties of the last century by the engineer Luigi Onorati as part of the project that led to the construction of the waterfront, located in the city center, perpendicular to the beginning of the northern waterfront, has been for decades now, the meeting place of the Sambenedettese population and the surrounding area. Pedestrian area, recently renovated, home to the city's historic premises and numerous commercial activities, for some years now it has been enriched by a collection of works of modern art, in particular sculptures, by Ugo Nespolo, Enrico Baj, Mark Kostabi, Paolo Consorti, Marco Lodola, Paolo Annibali.
The center of the course, a key meeting place of the town, is the Giorgini square (or Giorgini rotunda), dedicated to Carlo Giorgini, one of the most beloved mayors of the city, located at the intersection of the end of Viale Secondo Moretti and the north start of the waterfront. The fountain located in the center of the square has now become a symbol of the city.


=== Seafront ===

In 1931, on the project of the engineer Luigi Onorati, the promenade was built which, still today, as well as being an essential means of communication, is the center of San Benedetto. Considered disproportionate at the time of construction, it has a roadway with a total width of 30 meters and starts from the Giorgini roundabout (the rotunda), at the end of the central Viale Moretti, and, in its northernmost part, for the withdrawal of the sea consequent to the continuous enlargement of the port, it is very backward compared to the sea shore. Concludes at the Salvo D'Acquisto roundabout in Porto d'Ascoli for a total length of about 6 km.
It is bordered by lush gardens, a pine forest, tennis courts, a skating rink and a building, the "Palazzina Azzurra", the city's local historian, on the mouth of the Albula stream that determines the end of the first stretch, to the south of which the most touristy area, with beachside resorts on one side and villas and hotels on the other side of the road. A peculiar feature of the waterfront is the abundant presence of palm trees (mainly Phoenix canariensis and Phoenix sylvestris) which have become a bit of a city symbol (today, between public and private gardens and along the city avenues, there are a total of about 8,000 palm trees of various species) in the tourist sense, having taken the same tourist promotion company the name of Riviera delle Palme.
In 2001 the cycle path was completed which is a single walk to Cupra Marittima to the north and to Porto d'Ascoli to the south. The southern part of the waterfront has been subject to interventions at different times. In 2004, a radical reconstruction was launched which saw the modernization of the first part of the southern promenade: both the pedestrian area and the cycle path were extended. Then in 2007 the 2nd section was inaugurated. The cycle path is part of the larger project called Ciclovia Adriatica which once completed will connect the entire Adriatic coast.

In addition to the pedestrian area and the cycle path, there are "thematic gardens", the "oases": arid garden, wet garden, palm garden, rose garden, Mediterranean bush garden. The materials chosen are compatible with the new vocation of the waterfront in order to make these features look like real natural spaces on the sea, where to stop to admire the view, or for direct access to the beach. On the official website of the Municipality it is possible to admire the photos of the new waterfront and also make a virtual tour. In 2016, work began on the redevelopment of the northern promenade, which extends for about 2 km and goes from the "Palazzo Las Vegas" to the Albula stream.

The "Riviera delle Palme" is a beach located in San Benedetto del Tronto. It has annually been awarded a Blue Flag since 1998. The Blue Flag is a certification awarded to beaches and marinas by the Foundation for Environmental Education which qualify with its environmental standards.

=== Fishing ===
San Benedetto del Tronto has become, over the centuries, a fishing and tourist center of primary national importance. In 1912 the launch of a motorized fish-carrier began a process of transformation of the propulsion of the ships that, from the sail, reached the ocean fishing vessels. Alongside these events there have also been modernizations and developments also in other sectors directly linked to maritime activities, such as shipbuilding, hemp processing, cable and network construction, naval workshops, on-board instrumentation, fish marketing (San Benedetto boasts the most important wholesale fish market in Italy), the cold chains for the transport of fish.Although in continuous decline, this sector remains a driving force for the local economy if we do not consider only the properly maritime part (note that San Benedetto del Tronto is the second Italian port, behind Mazara del Vallo, for quantity of fish caught and number of fishing boats and one of the largest fish markets in Italy) but all related industries are taken into account and above all the highly developed canning industry which, established to support the marketing of fish, now operates on all food products, mainly fruit and vegetables.
