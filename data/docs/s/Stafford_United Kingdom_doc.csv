The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a British breed of short-haired terrier of medium size. It originated in the city of Birmingham and in the Black Country of Staffordshire, it is the direct descendent of the Bull and terrier which was itself bred from cross-breeding the Old English Bulldog and the Old English Terrier. The breed’s ancestors were bred primarily for the blood sports of dog fighting and rat-baiting.
With the introduction of legislation criminalising blood sports including dog fighting in 1835 and again in 1911, attitudes changed which resulted in generations of responsible breeding and further breed refinement of the Stafford as a family pet and companion dog. The Stafford's association in early 19th century as a fighting dog made it difficult for the breed to gain recognition by the Kennel Club in the United Kingdom but was eventually added to their purebred registry in 1935.The Stafford is one of the most popular companion dog breeds in the United Kingdom, as well as Australia, France and New Zealand.


== Characteristics ==
The Stafford is a stocky, muscular and unusually strong small to medium-sized dog that stands 14 to 16 in (36 to 41 cm) at the shoulder. The dogs weigh 29 to 37 lb (13 to 17 kg) and the bitches 24 to 34 lb (11 to 15 kg). It has a broad chest, strong shoulders, well-boned wide-set legs, a medium length tail that is carried low and a broad head with a short muzzle; its ears fold over at the tips and are not cropped. The Stafford's coat is short, stiff and close. Base colours can be red, fawn, white, black or blue, or any one of the aforementioned with white, any shade of brindle or any shade of brindle with white.


=== Temperament and health ===
Even in the days of blood sport, the Stafford was always a family pet and companion dog, and is even more so today. They are considered loyal, courageous and affectionate, and are among the dog breeds recommended by the KC as suitable for families. They have a reputation for pugnaciousness, and when challenged by another dog it is characteristic of them to not back away. It is recommended that puppies receive early socialisation; certainly before 18 months. Staffords are healthy and robust dogs with a life expectancy of 12–14 years. Hereditary eye conditions, including L-2 Hydroxy Glutaric Aciduria (L-2HGA) and Hereditary Cataract (HC-HSF4Hereditary, are known to occur in the breed. The condition is caused by a mutant gene that can be identified through DNA screening to determine if the dog is clear, a carrier or affected. The KC, AKC, various other reputable organisations and breed clubs run DNA screening schemes and maintain the results in an effort to accurately identify and eliminate undesirable genetic diseases.


== History ==


=== Early protection ===
The Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 made blood sports illegal, and effectively stopped bull and bear baiting in the UK. Bull and bear-baiting required large arenas which made it easier for authorities to police, whereas illegal dog fighting was much harder to terminate because fight sponsors kept their venues hidden and closely guarded in private basements and similar locations. As a result, dog fighting continued long after bull and bear-baiting had ceased. It was not until the passage of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 that organised dog fighting in Britain largely came to an end.


=== Early history ===
In the early 1800s, “bull and terrier” crossbreeds had been developed to satisfy the need for vermin control and the taste for blood sports. In the mid–19th century, James Hinks wanted to develop a socially acceptable "gentleman's companion" with refinement, cleaner lines, and courage without the aggressive tendencies. Two different types of bull and terriers resulted, including Hink's cross of the bull and terrier with the English White Terrier to achieve a more refined appearance with better legs and a more appealing head. A later outcross included the Dalmatian and Collie which led to the development of an athletic white dog known as Hink's "white cavalier", the forerunner to the modern Bull Terrier. Devotees preferred the original bull and terrier type over Hink's Bull Terrier, and remained loyal to their preferred type, which became the modern Staffordshire Bull Terrier of the same ancestry as the Bull Terrier.


=== Theories of origin ===
The Stafford was developed in what was then considered the "black country" of Staffordshire and northern parts of Birmingham. There are two theories about the development of the Stafford as recognised by the KC registry.The first and more widely held theory is that the Stafford, like the Bull Terrier, descends from the long-extinct bull and terrier, which originated as a cross between the ferocious, thickly muscled Old English Bulldog and the agile, lithe and feisty Black and Tan Terrier. The aggressive Old English Bulldog, bred for bear and bull baiting, was often pitted against its own kind in organised dog fights, but it was determined that lighter, faster dogs were better suited for dogfighting than the heavier Bulldog. In an effort to produce a lighter, faster, more agile dog with the courage and tenacity of the Bulldog, breeders outcrossed with local terriers and ultimately achieved success.The second less widely held theory is that the Old English Bulldog was not crossed with terriers; rather, the Stafford as a breed began with direct descendants derived from generations of selective breeding of early Bulldogs which produced a smaller dog with a more athletic build. Some believe the theory is evidentially supported by certain genetic characteristics and similarities in the appearances of modern Staffords when compared to the Old English Bulldogs depicted in some of the early 19th-century paintings.


=== DNA analysis ===
In 2017, a genome-wide study revealed that all of the bull and terrier–type dogs, including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, map back to the terriers of Ireland and to origins which date to the period 1860–1870. The timing coincides with historical descriptions of dog fighting contests in Ireland, a lack of accurate stud book documentation, and subsequently, the undocumented crosses of dogs during the time when these breeds were first created. By 1874, in Britain the first Kennel Club Stud Book was published, which included Bull Terriers and Bulldogs.


== Global recognition ==
In addition to recognition by the KC in 1935, the Stafford was later recognised in the breed registries of various other kennel clubs, including the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, the American Kennel Club, Australian National Kennel Council, Canadian Kennel Club, Irish Kennel Club, New Zealand Kennel Club, and the United Kennel Club in the United States.


=== Kennel Club ===
The Stafford's early origins as a fighting dog made it difficult to gain recognition as a breed for entry in the KC's breed registry. In 1930, the name "Staffordshire Bull Terrier" first appeared in advertisements for dogs of the type. Throughout 1932 and 1933 attempts were made by dog show judge and breeder Joseph Dunn to gain breed registry recognition from the KC.
In early 1935, the first show was held on the bowling green of the Conservative Club at Cradley Heath and in May that year, the KC approved the name "Staffordshire Bull Terrier" (the first name requested, "Original Bull Terrier", was rejected by the Kennel Club). In June 1935, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed during a meeting at the Old Cross Guns pub in Cradley Heath. That same day, the breed standards were approved and further shows were held that year. Other pivotal breeders involved in acquiring breed recognition were Joe Mallen and actor Tom Walls. The first champions recognised in England were awarded in 1939 to the bitch Lady Eve and the dog Gentleman Jim.


=== American Kennel Club ===
Staffordshires, as the English bull and terrier crosses have been historically referred, first arrived in North America in the mid to late 1800s. AKC would not recognize anything they deemed to be pit bull types into their breed registry as they neither endorsed nor wanted to be associated with dog fighting. It was not until 1936, long after blood sports were banned and legislation was enacted, that AKC recognised and accepted the Staffordshire Terrier into its purebred registry, and in 1972 changed the name to American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff). AKC recognition of the English bred Staffordshire Bull Terrier (Stafford) would come two years later.In an effort to achieve AKC recognition of the Stafford, Steve Stone organised the US Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, January 14, 1967. There were few Staffords in the country at that time, most being imports from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other parts of the world. The first attempts to encourage club membership and gain AKC recognition began with the first rally held in the summer of 1967 which resulted in 14 memberships and 8 Staffords registered by the club. By year's end, the count had increased to 39 registered dogs. Dog imports continued, and the number of memberships and registered dogs increased exponentially but it would take nearly a decade of hosting sanctioned shows and demonstrating consistency in the breed standard by maintaining responsible breeding practices that the club would acquire official AKC recognition.In 1974, the AKC officially recognised the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, giving it recognition as the official AKC Parent Club representing the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. On March 5, 1974, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was the 120th breed recognised by the AKC. Confusion often arises over the Stafford and AmStaff being separate breeds, typically because of the similarities in nomenclature, appearances, ancestry, and variances between the standards of several different purebred registries.


== Appeal ==

Staffords appeal for owners is for the most part because of their stout agility and muscular bodies which makes them appear tough while at the same time they are loving, courageous and loyal family dogs that are people-friendly. A survey conducted by Eukanuba revealed that Staffords and West Highland White Terriers are the "most communicative and affectionate breeds" with the Stafford being the "‘waggiest’ (80%) and most partial to a belly rub (62%)". In 2019, ITV’s Britain's favourite dogs declared the Staffordshire Bull Terrier as the most popular dog breed in Britain. They rank among the most popular dog breeds in the UK, Australia, France and New Zealand.Due in part to its popularity, Staffords have experienced some negative impacts from over-breeding. In 2013, the breed accounted for more than a third of the dogs passing through shelters such as Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. The breed has been associated with chav culture, which tends to attract the negativity associated with it.
According to American Kennel Club, it was their 82nd most popular dog in 2019.


== Breed-specific legislation ==

In the United States the Stafford is commonly classified as a pit bull-type dog along with the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier, in other countries including the United Kingdom the term pit bull is used as an abbreviation for the American Pit Bull Terrier and does not encompass the Stafford. A number of federal and municipal governments have placed restrictions on the ownership of the pit bull-type dogs, including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Some areas also regulate or restrict other breeds such as Dalmatian, German Shepherd, Chow Chow, American Bulldog, Rottweiler, Mastiff, Doberman Pinscher, and any mix or even a resemblance of those dogs. In the US, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is opposed to breed-specific legislation, referring to it as "breed-discriminatory laws". In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, Staffords are not restricted by any breed-specific legislation.The AKC "supports state laws making any form of participation in organized dog fights a felony" and oppose the breeding and training of dogs for fighting. They also oppose the "training of dogs for uncontrolled aggressive behavior toward other dogs and people." However, the AKC considers Breed-specific legislation (BSL) "a slippery slope" stating that "any dog can be exploited and trained to be aggressive" and expressed concern because they believe "breed-specific bans ultimately punish responsible dog owners, while doing very little to actually punish irresponsible owners."In 2018, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) lobbied the British Parliament to have the Staffordshire Bull Terrier added to the list of restricted dog breeds in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. PETA supported the legislation because they believed it would prevent more Staffords from being born into a world of cruel treatment and abuse. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the KC, Dogs Trust, Blue Cross and the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home all objected to the proposed ban. Defra minister George Eustice gave his support saying, "Staffordshire bull terriers [sic] are a popular breed in this country and have shown themselves to be a good family pet." Parliament rejected the legislation.


=== Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier ===
In the UK, American Pit Bull Terriers are sometimes advertised as Irish Staffordshire Bull Terriers in an attempt to circumvent the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. The appearance of the Irish Staffordshire, which is not recognised by any kennel club or breed registry, is attributed by the RSPCA to be contributing "to a rise in incidents of dog fighting". The editor of Dogs Today magazine described the breed as "complete fiction".
