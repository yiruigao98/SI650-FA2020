== Etymology ==
As per historical legend, the land around Srivilliputhur was under the rule of Queen Malli. The queen had two sons called Villi and Kandan. While the two were hunting in a forest, a tiger killed Kandan. Unaware of this, Villi searched for his brother, got tired and fell asleep. In his dream, divinity narrated to him what happened to his brother. By divine orders, Villi founded a city. The city is originally named after its founder, Villi forming the word Sri-Villi-Puthur. Thiru is the Tamil salutation and an alternative to Sanskrit word  "Sri" and that is why it is also called as a Thiruvilliputhur.As per another legend, the town is called the town of the bowman from the Tamil word villi meaning bow.


== History ==
The history of Srivilliputhur centres around the Srivilliputhur Temple, dedicated to Andal (8th century or earlier), the only female Alvar of the 12 Alvar saints of South India. She is credited with the Tamil works of Thirupavai and Nachiar Tirumozhi that are still recited by devotees during the Winter festival season of Margazhi. Andal is known for her unwavering devotion to god Vishnu, the God of the Srivaishnavas.  Adopted by her father, the Alvar saint Periyalvar who found her as a baby, Andal avoided earthly marriage, the normal and expected path for women of her culture, to "marry" Vishnu, both spiritually and physically. In many places in India, particularly in Tamil Nadu, Andal is treated more than a saint and as a form of god herself and a shrine for Andal is dedicated in most Vishnu temples.
During the reign of Tirumala Nayaka (1623–1659) and Rani Mangammal (1689–1706), this city became very popular. Tirumala Nayaka renovated the temples of this city. Nayak built a palace similar, but smaller in size to that of Thirumalai Nayakkar Palace in Madurai. Entry to this well preserved historical complex is presently restricted by the Archaeological Department of India which is managing this palace complex. From 1751 to 1756 A.D., Srivilliputhur came under the rule of Nerkattumseval palayakkarar Puli thevar and was a maravarpalayam. Later the Fort of Srivilliputhur was ruled by Periyasami Thevar. Then it fell into the hands of Mohammed Yusuf Khan during 1756. The troops of Yusuf won over the Polygars in the region. When they tried to invade Srivilliputhur, a Brahmin fell from the top of the temple tower as a mark of protest. Though Muslims, the troops retreated at the sight of the shattering brain in front of a Hindu temple might draw further wrath. During 1801, there were battles between polygars in the region and the British. One of the rebels, Sivattaiya Nayak was captured in the town during the same year. During February 1811, the town was suffering from an epidemic. Until 1850, Sri Andal temple was under the care of the king of Travancore. The British ruled the country till India attained freedom in 1947.
