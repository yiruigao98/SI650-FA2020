Sorong is the largest city of the Indonesian province of West Papua. The city is located on the western tip of the island of New Guinea with its only land borders being with Sorong Regency. It is the gateway to Indonesia's Raja Ampat Islands, species rich coral reef islands in an area considered the heart of the world's coral reef biodiversity.  It also is the logistics hub for Indonesia's thriving eastern oil and gas frontier. Sorong has experienced exponential growth since 2010, and further growth is anticipated as Sorong becomes linked by road to other frontier towns in Papua's Bird's Head Peninsula. The city had a population of 190,625 at the 2010 Census; the latest official estimate (as at mid 2019) is 254,294.  It is served by Domine Eduard Osok Airport.


== Etymology ==
The origin of Sorong's name comes from the word Soren, which means "deep and wavy ocean" in the Biak language. The name was first used by the Biak-Numfor people who sailed to different islands before they finally decided to settle down in Raja Ampat Islands. When the Biak-Numfor people came to the place called "Daratan Maladum", they decided to call it Soren. After centuries of contact with Chinese merchants, European missionaries, and people from Maluku and Sangihe-Talaud, the name underwent further change into Sorong.


== Administrative Districts ==
At the 2010 Census, the city comprised six districts (distrik), but the number has subsequently been increased to ten by the splitting of existing districts. These are tabulated below with their populations at the 2010 Census, together with the latest estimates for mid-2019. The table also includes the number of administrative villages (desa and kelurahan, 41 in total) in each district and its post code.

Note: (a) Sorong Kepulauan district includes 25 offshore islands within the city limits, including Doom, Soop, Raam and Umbre Islands. (b) the populations as at 2010 of the four new districts established after 2010 are included in the figures for the districts from which they were split off.
