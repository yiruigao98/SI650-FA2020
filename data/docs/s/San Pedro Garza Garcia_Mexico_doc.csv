The municipality has an area of 69.4 km2 (26.8 sq mi) and is almost entirely urban, lying adjacent to the southwest side of Monterrey. It sits in a valley surrounded by mountains; most notably La Loma Larga and Sierra Madre Oriental.


== Government ==
The current Municipal President (Mayor) of San Pedro is Miguel Treviño de Hoyos, an independent candidate.San Pedro Garza Garcia was founded in 1596. The land was converted into a large plantation called "Los Nogales", where crops like corn, wheat, beans, and many other foods were produced.
During the 18th century, the plantation often went by the name of "San Pedro", in honor of Saint Peter.
The city was not elevated to the status of "Villa" (Village) until December 14, 1882, when it was given the name Garza García, in honor of the governor of Nuevo León, Genaro Garza García.
It was not until 1988 that the mayor at the time, Alejandro Chapa Salazar gave the city its current name, adding the reference to what it was called centuries before.
