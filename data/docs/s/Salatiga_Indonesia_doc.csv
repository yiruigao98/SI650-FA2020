Salatiga (Javanese: ꦯꦭꦠꦶꦒ) is a city in Central Java province, Indonesia. Located between the cities of Semarang and Surakarta, it sits at the foot of Mount Merbabu (3,142 m) and Mount Telomoyo, and has a relatively cool climate due to its elevated position. Salatiga is a part of the Semarang metropolitan area.


== Etymology ==

Salatiga is thought to be named either after the goddess of Trisala, or after the three wrongs done to the first king of Semarang.
In the first explanation, the people of the village celebrate the goddess of Siddhadewi, who is mentioned in the Monolith of Plumpungan. Siddhadewi was also called Trisala, so the village was called Trisala and in the years to come became Salatri and eventually Salatiga.The second explanation is based on the story of Ki Ageng Pandanaran, the first regent of Semarang, who was robbed by three muggers, and he thus named the location Salah Telu. Salah means wrong in both Indonesian and Javanese. Telu is Low Javanese for three, spelled is tiga in both the more refined Middle/High Javanese (but pronounced /tigo/ in Javanese respectively /tiga/ in Indonesian). Hence the name Salatiga from Salah Tiga.


== History ==
The official birth date of Salatiga is 24 July 750 A.D. (the 31st date and 4th year of the Saka calendar).  The scroll Monolith of Plumpungan (Prasasti Plumpungan in Sanskrit) by King Bhanu, declares May you be happy! All the people ("Srir = astu swasti prajabhyah") and designated village of Hampran (Desa Hampran) a Perdikan village (Desa Perdikan, meaning a tax-free village). "Çrirastuswasti Prajabyah" is the official motto of Salatiga as written in the government seal.
In 1746, the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, VOC) built De Hersteller fort in Salatiga because Salatiga was strategically located at the intersection between Semarang, Surakarta and Magelang.

On 1 July 1917 the village of Salatiga was designated as a stads gemeente or small town by the Dutch East Indies government. In the colonial era, Salatiga was stratified by race. The Europeans live near the city centre, at the Toentangscheweg (Toentang Road) because it leads to Semarang and also near to Dutch plantations in the Salatiga Afdeling. The Chinese live near the trading centre, the Kalicacing Market, at the Soloscheweg (Solo Road). The native people live outside the European and Chinese communities. The education system was divided by race, with different schools for the Europeans, the Chinese and the natives. Salatiga was led by a burgermeester (mayor), assisted by College van Burgermeester en Wethouders. There was a legislative body, the Stadsgemeenteraad; however, its membership was not proportional, with 8 seats for the Europeans, 1 seat for the Chinese, and only 2 seats for the natives who form the majority of the people. The birth of Salatiga was accompanied by the world economic depression of the 1930s, so the development of the city was halted, and to solve the increase of the city's spending, the salaries of government officials were cut by up to 15%. Salatiga had an important economic role as a hinterland to Semarang, providing products from coffee, rubber, cacao, cotton, spices, tobacco, wheat and vegetable plantations to Semarang to be processed.Supported by geographical factors, its cool climate, and its luxurious buildings with Indies architecture, Salatiga's beauty was well known during the Dutch colonisation, even it was called De Schoonste Stad van Midden-Java (The Most Beautiful City in Central Java).
