Emmerich, formerly called Embrika and Emrik, was originally a Roman colony. Around the year 700 Saint Willibrord founded the mission "Emmerich" in the Utrecht diocese. The oldest documented name is Villa Embrici, which survives from the year 828.

The collegiate church St. Martinikirche was constructed in 1040.
On 31 May 1233 Count Otto von Zutphen and Gelder arose to the royalty of the prosperous city with the authorization of the Roman Emperor Frederick II and the German King Henry (VII) Emmerich. In 1371 it fell to the Duchy of Cleves, and passed with it in 1609 to the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The town joined the Hanseatic League in 1407. In 1794 it was bombarded by the French under General Vandamme, and in 1806 it was assigned to the Duchy of Berg. It passed into the possession of Prussia in 1815.In 1856 the railway section Oberhausen-Arnhem, of the Cologne-Mindener Railway was opened.
