== History ==
Saku is located in former Shinano Province, and by the Sengoku period it was home to the Ochiai clan, a samurai family that sided with Uesugi Kenshin during his conflict with Takeda Shingen in the 1550s. The Ochiai clan consequently fought for the Uesugi during the Siege of Katsurayama in March 1557; all Ochiai members who took part in the battle were killed in combat or committed suicide. During the Edo period the area of Saku developed as the castle town of Tatsuoka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate and as a post town. Following the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Saku District, with the town of Asama, and the village of Higashi (from Kitasaku District) merging with the towns of Nozawa and Nakagomi (both from Minamisaku District) to create the city of Saku.
