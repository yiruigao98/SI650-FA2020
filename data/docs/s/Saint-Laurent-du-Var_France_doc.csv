Saint-Laurent-du-Var (Occitan: Sant Laurenç de Var, Italian: San Lorenzo del Varo) is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region on the French Riviera.


== History ==
The town was founded in the 11th century when a hospice was founded under Saint Lawrence's protection. The main activity was to help passengers to cross the Var, which became a border between Kingdom of France and County of Nice in 1481.


== Geography ==
St. Laurent is the second-largest suburb of the city of Nice, after Cagnes-sur-Mer, in the urban community of Nice Côte d'Azur. It lies adjacent to it on the west side on the other side of the river Var.
Nowadays, the town has developed much and its population has been multiplied by ten in the last century and it is now part of Nice metropolitan area.
The suburb's positioning, close to Nice and with an abundance of flatlands - which is a rare resource in this region - led to the building of CAP 3000, the Côte d'Azur's biggest mall, and an industrial zone with many dynamic activities.
