== History ==
The first known occupants of the region of the current municipality were the charrúa and minuane indigenous. Then came Spanish Jesuits, then throughout the 19th century came Portuguese and Italian immigrants. In 1810, the political instability that would lead to the independence of the Spanish colonies in the Platina Basin led to the arrival of Portuguese troops to the region, in order take advantage of the opportunity and extend their empire in areas of temperate weather so coveted by them. These troops, commanded by Diogo de Sousa, Count of Rio Pardo, began the present city of Santana do Livramento, through the construction of a chapel dedicated to the homonymous saint. The permanent Portuguese settlement of the region began with the donation of sesmarias made by the Marquês of Alegrete in 1814. Founded the city on July 30, 1823, it was elevated to the category of municipality in 1857, emancipating itself from Alegrete.
