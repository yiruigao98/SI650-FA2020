San Gabriel  is a city in Los Angeles County, California.  It is named after the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel (which in turn was named for Archangel Gabriel), founded by Junípero Serra.  The city grew outward from the mission and in 1852 became the original township of Los Angeles County.  San Gabriel was incorporated in 1913. The city's motto is "A city with a Mission" and it is often called the "Birthplace" of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. At the 2010 census, the population was 39,718.


== History ==
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish to Alta California, the area that is now San Gabriel was inhabited by the Tongva Native Americans, whom the Spanish called the Gabrieleño.  The Tongva name for the San Gabriel region has been reconstructed as Shevaa.Today a center for culture and art, the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel (named for Archangel Gabriel), founded by Father Junipero Serra, is the fourth of twenty-one California Missions, and is known as the "Pride of the California Missions."The Mission San Gabriel Arcángel served a pivotal role in the colonial Spanish society, with many of the area's first Mexican settlers being baptized at the mission, including future governor Pio Pico, who was born in 1801 at the mission and baptized there the same year. He was appointed as California's governor twice, serving briefly in 1832 and again from 1845 through the Mexican–American War. Later in life, he was elected as a Los Angeles City councilman. The city of Pico Rivera was named to honor him as the last governor of California to be born in Mexico.In 1853, a company of Army Engineers, which included the geologist William P. Blake, passed by the mission in search of the best route for an intercontinental railroad. Blake observed that the once great vineyards had fallen into wild disarray. Fences were in disrepair and animals roamed freely through the property. But the mission bells were ringing and the church was still in use. Blake predicted, "I believe that when the adaptation of that portion of California to the culture of the grape and the manufacture of wine becomes known and appreciated, the state will become celebrated not only for its gold and grain, but (also) for its fruits and wines."In the first United States census made in California in 1860, 586 people lived in the San Gabriel township, an area encompassing the mission lands and several adjacent ranchos stretching north to what is now Pasadena.  By 1870, the population had shrunk to 436. By the time of General Law Incorporation on April 24, 1913, the city's population had grown to 1,500.

=== Transportation ===

San Gabriel is currently served by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
In 2008, voters approved the measure, proposition 1A for the California High Speed Rail Project from San Diego to San Francisco. The project will be constructed in two segments. The San Francisco to Los Angeles/Anaheim project is scheduled to be built first, at a cost of $43 billion, with a completion date in 2029. The second phase of the proposed railway, from Los Angeles to stations in San Diego will not begin construction until after phase one is completed. The California High-Speed Rail Authority is responsible for planning, designing, and building the system.
Conceptually, the voters were very enthusiastic about a high speed railway. The reality of the possibility that it could impact their neighborhood and their homes is being met with steadfast disapproval.  When the California High-Speed Rail Authority recently met with the city councils and residents of San Gabriel, El Monte, Rosemead and Alhambra, to discuss the four proposed routes for phase two, the members of the three city councils expressed that residents were very concerned that the railway could possibly end up in their backyards.  Mayor David Gutierrez said  "We made a promise to the community that the city of San Gabriel will never allow anything like this to happen if there is any consideration that people might lose their home." No decisions will be made until environmental impact and evaluation of the various proposed routes are completed in 2014. Alhambra city councilwoman, Jessica Keating,
maintained that city representatives, who had initially appeared to agree with the proposal, admitted they were "caught asleep at the wheel."
