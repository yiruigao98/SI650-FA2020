== History ==
Long before Indiana became a state, long before the founding of Schererville, people called the area the "Crossroads,"  as several Native American trails intersected here, that later became routes for the wagons of settlers traveling west.
One of those settlers was Nicholas Scherer, who was born in 1830 at Scheuern, today part of Tholey, Saarland, in southwestern Germany, who arrived in the U.S. in 1846. When he came to this place at the southern tip of Lake Michigan in 1865, he founded the community that bears his name.Today, trails still cross at Schererville, the modern trails of a motorized society, U.S. Highways 41 and 30. Nearby are newer trails, I-80/94 and I-65. All these are primary transcontinental routes and gives Schererville its slogan: "Crossroads of the Nation."
The town was named one of the "100 Best Places to Live in the U.S." by Money Magazine in 2007.
Schererville's former Town Council President, Perry Ferrini, died on December 13, 2009.  The Town Council's new president became Jerry Tippy, and the vacant seat held by Perry was filled by Sharon Moore on January 9, 2010.
The town of Schererville celebrated its sesquicentennial in September, 2016.
