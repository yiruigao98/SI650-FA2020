Sampaloc is a district of Manila, Philippines. It is referred to as the University Belt or simply called “U-Belt” for numerous colleges and universities are found within the district such as the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest extant university in Asia; the National University, the first private nonsectarian and coeducational institution in the Philippines; the Far Eastern University, known for its Art Deco campus and cultural heritage site of the Philippines; and the University of the East, once dubbed as the largest university in Asia in terms of enrollment. The district is bordered by the districts of Quiapo and San Miguel in the south, Santa Mesa district in the south and east, Santa Cruz district in the west and north, and Quezon City in the northeast.
Aside from being the "University Belt", Sampaloc is also known to Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces for its Dangwa flower market, located in Dimasalang Road, well known as the selling center for cut flowers from all over the Philippines, mainly Baguio. Sampaloc is also the location of a former colonial mansion, now called Windsor Inn, which is popular among backpackers and budget travelers.
Barangays 395-636 of the City of Manila would all have belonged to Sampaloc and comprise 241 barangays for the district. However, what are now known as barangays 587-636 became part of Sta. Mesa when these areas were separated from Sampaloc after Sta. Mesa became a separate parish in 1911. Sta. Mesa is now a part of the 6th congressional district of Manila, while Sampaloc is the sole district comprising the 4th congressional district of Manila.
Many streets in Sampaloc, particularly in the northeast portion divided by España and Lacson avenues, have names that are directly associated with the Philippine National Hero José Rizal, either named after the places (e.g. Calamba, Dapitan), real-life people (e.g. Blumentritt), characters from his novels (e.g. Ibarra, Maria Clara) or his pen names (e.g. Laong Laan, Dimasalang).
