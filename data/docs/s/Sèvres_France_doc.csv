Sèvres is a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, 10.5 km (6.5 mi) to the west of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, with an eastern edge by the River Seine. The commune borders the Île Seguin, an island in the River Seine, in the commune of Boulogne-Billancourt, adjoining Sèvres.

Situation of Sèvres
		
		


=== Geology and landforms ===
The area of the commune is 391 hectares (970 acres). The altitude varies between 27–171 metres (89–561 ft).Work at Sèvres, including for the construction of the expressway, permitted an update of interesting fossils in different geological layers. For example, in chalk, some types of sea urchins, belemnite beaks, rhynchonellas, and oysters were found; in the coarse limestone, ammonites.


=== Hydrography ===
The Seine
The Ru de Marivel which empties into the Seine 80 metres (262 feet) upstream of the Pont de Sèvres.


=== Climate ===
The climate of île-de-France is oceanic. The popular observation stations for meteorology at Sèvres are Orly and Vélizy-Villacoublay airport.The climate in the departments of the small Parisian crown is characterised by sunshine and relatively low precipitation. The following table allows a comparison of the île-de-France climate with that of some large French cities:

=== Routes of communication and transport ===


==== Roads ====
Sèvres is traversed from side to side by the RN 10, today downgraded and allowing connection of the city to Boulogne-Billancourt and Chaville. It is also the starting point of the RN 118 at the level of the Pont de Sèvres.


==== Cycle paths ====
Sèvres presents a main traffic artery which supports important transit traffic at morning and evening peak hours. This allows preservation of its secondary residential purpose from suffering the negative effects of through traffic, and on which the development zone 30 was under study, as early as 2007. The city hall has, however, launched a reconsideration on these routes for sharing public spaces in favour of soft links (comfortable pavements, if possible with the development of cycle paths) and the use of public transit where they pass (comfortable bus stops, creation of own sites where technical conditions permit). Since November 2011, fifteen streets have two-way cycle lanes. They are the subject of ground markings and installation of specific signaling panels:

Avenue de la Cristallerie
Rue Brancas, between the Rue de Ville-d'Avray and Rue Bernard-Palissy
Grande Rue, between the Rue de Ville-d'Avray and the Place Gabriel-Péri
Rue du Docteur Gabriel-Ledermann, between the Rue de Rueil and Rue Jules Sandeau

Rue Albert Dammouse, between Rue Avice and the Stade des Fontaines turn
Rue Rouget-de-l'Isle
Rue Jules-Ferry

== Urbanism ==


=== Urban morphology ===
INSEE has divided the commune into ten islets grouped for statistical information.
The commune of Sèvres includes 16 quarters, named as follows:


=== Housing ===
In the project planning and sustainable development (PADD) approved 10 May 2007, the commune displays an ambition to maintain its population around its situation of early 2005. It has a commitment to offer every household in the commune the opportunity to live and grow in Sèvres, and a stake in preserving its fabric of facilities and local businesses. Studies conducted in the context of the PLH show that by 2015, this would involve the construction of approximately 40 homes per year (taking into account of the transformation of the former park, of the reduction of the vacancy rate and the loosening of household size) to maintain the communal population.
In 2005, the commune had 24.5% of its total as social housing. These homes are mostly located along the RD 910, around the city centre. The commune displays a desire to preserve this social mix by ensuring a diversity of different types of housing, under the framework of future construction operations. As such, it shows the will to maintain its social housing stock at around 25% of the total stock of main residences. On the other hand, private rental declined between 1990 and 1999. An effort in favour of this type of housing will be always sought in order to maintain the diversity of population profiles. Some areas of the city are poorly provided with social housing, and the development of this type of housing should allow a better balance across the commune.


=== Development projects ===
The main projects are:

The reconstruction of the Croix Bosset school
The development of links between the banks of the Seine, the city, parks and woodlands by pedestrian openings designed to develop a frame of soft East/West links. Such as linking Saint-Cloud Park / île Monsieur, between Brimborion Park and the Brimborion tram station, along the Seine, a development project of the entrance of Sèvres and the vicinity of the Museum of Manufacturing by the creation of a pedestrian/bicycle along the Grande Rue, behind the wall of the Museum.


== Toponymy ==
The name of the locality is attested as Savara in the 6th century, originating from the name of the stream which followed the Valley of Viroflay, Chaville, Sèvres. Then in the forms of Villa Savara in the 6th century,Saura, Saure, Savra, Saevara in the 11th century, Severa, Sepera and Separa in the 13th century, Sevra, Sièvre, Saives, Sèvre-en-France-lez-paris from the 14th century, before Sèvres.Sèvres took the name of the river which ran through it. Sèvres includes radical sav-, sab-, in the sense of "hollow" or radical sam- "quiet". These radicals are often used in hydronymy.The root is the same for the Sèvre Nantaise and the Sèvre Niortaise which gave its name to the Department of the Deux-Sèvres.


== History ==

The town of Sèvres existed in 560, when Saint Germain, Bishop of Paris, healed a sick person and built the church.

The manufacture de Sèvres was formed in 1750, by the Ferme générale; they were held by the Marquis de Fulvi who operated at Vincennes.
In 1756, Madame de Pompadour transferred the Vincennes porcelain factory to Sèvres. It was moved to the location of the Guyarde, the former resort of Lully.

In 1815, the inhabitants of Sèvres, along with some soldiers, tried to resist the Prussians who occupied and looted Sèvres, despite the capitulation signed at Saint-Cloud.
The Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920)A treaty was signed in the large room which currently houses the Museum of Porcelain at Sèvres, it was a peace treaty between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, to the detriment of the latter.

In 1961, the renovation of old town centre, which was unhealthy, accompanied by the deviation of the RN 10, was committed to by the municipality of Dr. Odic, and included the demolition of 1,500 houses and the construction of 1,600 new houses, along with 42,000 square metres (450,000 sq ft) of offices or commercial premises.
