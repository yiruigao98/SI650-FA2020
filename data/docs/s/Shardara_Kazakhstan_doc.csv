Turkistan Region (Kazakh: Түркістан облысы, romanized: Túrkistan oblysy; Russian: Туркестанская область), previously South Kazakhstan Region (Kazakh: Оңтүстік Қазақстан облысы, romanized: Ońtústik Qazaqstan oblysy; Russian: Южно-Казахстанская область, romanized: Yuzhno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast), is the southernmost region of Kazakhstan. Population: 2,469,367 (2009 Census results); 1,978,339 (1999 Census results). Its capital is Turkistan. Other cities in Turkistan Region include Sayram, Kentau, Arys, Shardara, Zhetisay, Saryagash, and Lenger. This region and Atyrau Region are Kazakhstan's two smallest regions; both are about 117,300 square kilometers in area. Turkistan Region borders the neighboring country of Uzbekistan (and is very near the Uzbekistan capital Tashkent), as well as three other Kazakhstan regions: Karaganda Region (to the north), Kyzylorda Region (to the west), and Jambyl Region (to the east). The Syr Darya passes through the region, on its way to the Aral Sea. Also, an oil pipeline runs from Turkmenabat, Turkmenistan to Omsk, Russia (where it connects with a larger, Siberian pipeline) through South Kazakhstan. Oil, lead and zinc are refined in Shymkent.
The Region was originally formed in the Kazakh SSR within the Soviet Union by the name South Kazakhstan Oblast. In 1962, it was renamed Chimkent Oblast, but this only lasted until 1992, when it was changed back to the old name. In 2018, it was changed to Turkistan Oblast, which is the current name.
The administrative center of the region was Shymkent until 19 June 2018, when it was taken out of the region and subordinated directly to the central government.  The administrative center was moved to Turkistan, and the region renamed Turkistan Region.


== Demographics ==
Turkistan Region is the most densely populated of Kazakhstan's many regions. This derives from the oblast's gentler climate, better irrigation infrastructure, and proximity to historical population centers (such as Uzbekistan's Tashkent and the Silk Road cities of Samarkand and Bukhara). It is also the fastest growing of Kazakhstan's regions, due to two main factors. One is the birthrate among traditional Kazakh and Uzbek families, where families of five to eight children are commonplace. The other is the exodus of cheap migrant labor from northern Uzbekistan. These migrant workers sometimes become full-fledged immigrants, and if they are ethnic Kazakhs this process is easily green-lighted through local governments for an (unacknowledged and under-the-table) fee.
As such, Turkistan Region is the only region with a demographic breakdown where ethnic Russians are not in the first or second most populous categories. Census results are old and made using Soviet methods that served propaganda over accuracy, but they still point to Kazakhs being the most populous, closely followed by Uzbeks, with Russians bringing in a distant third.
As of 2020, Turkistan Region has a population of 2,016,037.Ethnic groups (2020):
Kazakh: 75.98%
Uzbek: 17.11%
Tajik: 1.87%
Russian: 1.73%
Azerbaijani: 0.93%
Others: 2.38%Note, the ethnicity figures exclude the City of Shymkent, which in 2018 became administratively separate from the region.


== Languages ==
Main languages are Kazakh, Russian (including as means of international dialogue) and Uzbek.


== History ==
Historically speaking, South Kazakhstan Region is home to Kazakhstan's oldest and greatest marvels. Two thousand years ago it was part of the northern border of the Persian Empire. It owes its long history of habitation to a mixing of Persian culture and science with the native Turkic/Mongol tribal clans. South Kazakhstan Region was part of the Satrap of Sogdiana.
Some places of historical interest include the cities of Turkistan, Otrar and Sayram. Sayram was the birthplace of Ahmed Yasavi (1103–66), a great Sufic scholar and author that lived and worked throughout Central Asia. He is entombed in a mausoleum complex that stands in present-day Turkistan, and which has been named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It was commissioned by Amir Temur (Tamerlane) to increase his standing among the area. The mausoleum was built by Persian masters, though it was left unfinished with the death of Tamerlane. The original scaffolding that would have been used to apply the colored-tile still protrudes from the front entrance.
