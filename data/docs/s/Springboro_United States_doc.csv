== History ==
Settled as early as 1796, Springboro was founded in 1815 by Jonathan Wright, as "Springborough." Jonathan Wright's father Joel was a surveyor who plotted Columbus and Dayton, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky. Springboro was predominantly Quaker during its early years.
By the 1830s, two mills and a woolen factory in Springboro had been built up on the abundant springs for which the town was named.As a stop on the Underground Railroad, Springboro played a significant role by providing hiding places for escaping slaves. On October 17, 1999, Springboro was the first city to erect an Ohio Underground Railroad Historic Marker. The dedication was part of the 4th Annual Ohio Underground Railroad Summit.
Beginning in the late 1960s, Springboro's population began a boom that would redefine the city. Fueled by the growth of the Dayton Area, Springboro transformed from a sleepy town along I-75 into a real estate hotspot in the Miami Valley. Growth in Springboro led to a new highway exit being created at I-75 & Austin Boulevard and the construction of three new schools by the SCCSD in the 2000s. Today Springboro is one of the most important suburbs in the Cincinnati-Dayton metro area due to its stronghold on the growth between the two major cities. The mayor of Springboro is John H. Agenbroad, who was reelected in 2019. The vast majority of new development occurred to the east of SR-741 (Main Street).
