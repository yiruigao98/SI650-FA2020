The following is a list of the most populous incorporated places of the United States. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an "incorporated place" includes a variety of designations, including city, town, village, borough, and municipality. A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places. Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only that portion (or "balance") of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.
This list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. metropolitan area populations.


== 50 states and District of Columbia ==

The following table lists the 317 incorporated places in the United States (excluding the U.S. territories) with a population of at least 100,000 on July 1, 2019, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau.

The total land area (2019 estimate) of all cities over 100,000 is 29,482 square miles (76,360 km2).
The overall density (total population divided by total land area [2019]) is 3,238 inhabitants per square mile (1,250/km2).
The mean city population is 301,160.  The median city in population is number 185 (Syracuse) at 142,380.

== Island Areas ==

The U.S. Census Bureau has a defined area called the "Island Areas" — it contains every major U.S. territory except Puerto Rico. There are no cities in the Island Areas with more than 100,000 people. Below are the most populous cities in the Island Areas as of 2010.Saipan and Charlotte Amalie are capital cities, while Tafuna and Dededo are not.


== Census-designated places ==
The following table lists U.S. census-designated places (CDPs) with populations of at least 100,000 according to the 2010 Census.  A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places.  Unlike the incorporated cities in the main list, the US Census Bureau does not release annual population estimates for CDPs.
The table below contains the following information:

The census-designated place
The state
The city population as of April 1, 2010, as enumerated by the 2010 United States Census
The city population as of April 1, 2000, as enumerated by the 2010 United States Census
The city percent population change from April 1, 2000, to April 1, 2010
The city land area as of January 1, 2010
The city population density as of April 1, 2010 (residents per land area)
The city ANSI INCITS 446–2008 geographic code
The city latitude and longitude coordinates


== Cities formerly over 100,000 people ==
The following table lists U.S. cities that, in past censuses, have had populations of at least 100,000 but have since decreased beneath this threshold or have been consolidated with or annexed into a neighboring city.
The table below contains the following information:

Name of city
Name of state
The city population as of July 1, 2019, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau
The city's peak population based on highest official enumeration recorded by the Census (and the year of that particular Census)
The numeric decline in population from its peak Census count to the most recent Census estimate in 2018.
The percent decline in population from its peak Census count to the most recent Census estimate in 2018.
Any additional notes of significant importance.
