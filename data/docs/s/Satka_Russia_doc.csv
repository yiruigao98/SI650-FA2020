He was fielded against Sweden in the 83rd, but was notably involved in the controversy, that had led to resignation of Ján Kozák, then Slovakia's longest serving and most successful coach, who introduced him to the national team.Šatka violated the code of conduct of national team player, along with Martin Dúbravka, Michal Šulla, Norbert Gyömbér, Milan Škriniar, Vladimír Weiss and Stanislav Lobotka. On the night of 13 October 2018, after loss in Slovakia's second UEFA Nations League fixture and a derby match against Czech Republic (1–2), they left the hotel and went out, missed the bedtime and violated the wellness policy, regarding regeneration and rehabilitation. They were allegedly busted by Ján Kozák at about midnight, admitting to the incident and apologising during the next day. Ján Kozák resigned from the national team in afternoon hours of 14 October, revealing the details of his decision in a press conference on 18 October, to avoid distractions during the preparation for the fixture against Sweden, that was managed by his former assistant Štefan Tarkovič on a caretaker basis. Kozák cited his inability to work with the squad under such conditions as the primary reason, as about a third of the squad was involved. The coach additionally revealed, that when seeking an explanation from Šatka, on the day after the incident, he apparently claimed he "just went out with friends", to which Kozák sarcastically reacted:"If your friends jump out of the window, will you follow them?". President of SFZ, Ján Kováčik, said that the players will be punished by not receiving any financial rewards for any future nominations and performances in the national team during the upcoming qualification cycle.On 19 October, SFZ published Šatka's statement, in which he apologised to the entire footballing public of Slovakia, including the fans, SFZ, the team and his fans of DAC Dunajská Streda. He stressed that conduct was not aimed against the coach and he was saddened to learn about Kozák's resignation, being thankful to him for a chance in the senior national team. He stated that it was and it will be his honour to represent the country and that he takes lesson from what happened, now concentrating on his career and professionality off the field, accepting any sanctions from the club or SFZ.
