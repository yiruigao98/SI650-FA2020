== History ==
Santa Cruz is the oldest municipality in the province; it was founded on 5 October 1884, thirty-six years after the foundation of Davao, which is its mother city, by Don Jose Uyanguren of Guipúzcoa, Spain. It all started when Spanish pioneers and missionaries attempted to settle and Christianize the area in what is now Barangay Poblacion as early as 1880. But because of the relentless Islamic faith of the local people in the area, the enraged pioneers and missionaries planted a cross under a shelter to mark the failure of the missionaries to convert these people to Christianity; the town's name now bears the name of the cross planted by those Spaniards. Fortunately, for the next 4 years, the local people will submit themselves to Christianity and had themselves conquered by Angel Rodriguez, the Spanish Governor-General of Davao. But, like Don Uyanguren's attempt to develop the newly established Davao, the area around the young town did not prosper until after almost 20 years since then.
The Americans arrived in Davao in the early 1900s after the Spanish defeat in the Spanish–American War. Fourteen years later, the town began to grow economically, although overshadowed by the booming economic growth of its neighbour Davao. Several Japanese entrepreneurs like Kyusaburo Otta and Yoshizo Furukawa are living in the region to exploit more agricultural territories, the former in Davao and the latter in what is now the barangays Darong and Inauayan.
On 16 March 1936, its mother town, Davao, became one of the first two cities in Mindanao, the other being Zamboanga, due to the town's faster economic growth and agricultural boom.
On 1942, it was the beginning of Japanese invasion of the Philippines. The town suffered greatly during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, unlike its neighbor Davao, which fared well and continued its economic growth during that time. The local recognized guerrillas and the military troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units continued to attack the Imperial Japanese forces. On 1945, combined Filipino and American troops including recognized guerrillas fought the Japanese and liberated the town. The general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was active from 1945 to 1946 and was located in the town. After the war, most of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz moved to Davao in search of economic opportunities; despite this, the town continued its population and economic growth, though at a slower rate.
Almost three years after the Philippine Independence on 4 July 1946, two towns broke off from the municipality, namely: Padada, on 15 July 1949; and Digos on 19 July in the same year. In 1960's, a new municipality, Roxas, was carved out from the town, covering the present-day barangays of Inauayan, Darong, Astorga, Coronon, and Sibulan; however, the Supreme Court of the Philippines nullified the creation of the municipality since this meant the collapse of the jurisdiction of once the most Christianized town in Mindanao.
One of the municipalities which broke off from the town, Digos, became the capital town of the newly created Davao del Sur province in 1967; thirty-three years later it would become a city and will be the most populous in the entire province, excluding Davao City.


=== Aspiration for cityhood ===
On 5 October 2013, during the town's 129th anniversary of its existence, its local government leaders and populace have envisioned for a new aspiration for the town to become a city, given the presence of large industrial companies like the San Miguel Corporation, Coco Davao Inc., Franklin Baker Co., GSL Food Industries in the town. The municipal mayor Joel Ray Lopez commented, "As the oldest town in the province of Davao del Sur, we really wanted it to become a city soon." Its infrastructure have been moderately improved, and most of its cityhood requirements, specifically its income and total land area requirements, have been already met. When the municipality of Santa Cruz finally becomes a city, full industrialization in the area may be expected.
