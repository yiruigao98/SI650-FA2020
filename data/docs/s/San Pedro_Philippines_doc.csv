== History ==
San Pedro de Tunasán became a town on January 18, 1725, when King Charles II of Spain decreed that the town formerly known as "Tabuko" be a separate town from "Kabuyaw" (now known as the city of Cabuyao).By virtue of the last will of Philip V of Spain, Rodriguez de Figueroa or "Don Esteban", a group of Augustinian Fathers gained the ownership of the Tunasán Estate. Later on, San Pedro became an hacienda of Colegio de San José, a group of Jesuits friars who took over the property which now is known as "San Pedro Tunasán". Tunasán literally means "a place where there is Tunás" (Nymphaea nouchali), a medicinal plant abundant on shoreline area.During that period, agriculture, fishing, duck raising, fruit trees, and sampaguita were the main source of income of its residents. This period was highlighted by the growing tenant/landlord dispute. The tenants of Hacienda San Pedro Tunasán fought for their birthrights over their ancestral lands. This struggle took almost 423 years of unsuccessful resistance to Colegio de San José, and in 1938, the government bought the home sites of the San Pedro Tunasán Hacienda from the Colegio for re-sale to its tenants. This event laid to rest the tenants/landlord problem in the town.
In the year 1902, the name San Pedro de Tunasán was simplified to San Pedro.
From the Spanish time until after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the scenario did change a bit, when on August 30, 1954, beginning to the Philippine Commonwealth forces against the Japanese, President Ramón Magsaysay signed at the historic town plaza the Land Tenancy Act. By virtue of this law, farm lots of the hacienda were bought by the Philippine government to be sold at cost to the tenants or occupants of the farm lots in Bayan-Bayanan under the Narra Settlement Project of the Magsaysay Administration.


=== Cityhood ===
On March 27, 2013, President Benigno Aquino III signed the Republic Act No. 10420 converting the municipality into a new component city of the province of Laguna.  The cityhood of San Pedro was ratified through a plebiscite scheduled by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). The date for the ratification is December 28, 2013 after the National Barangay Elections. It became the sixth city of Laguna after the cities of Biñan, Cabuyao, Calamba, San Pablo, and Santa Rosa, and also the third to be a city in the 1st congressional district of Laguna - making it the first city district in the province.
COMELEC officially proclaimed the first-class municipality of San Pedro as a component city of Laguna on December 29, 2013. Juanito Icarro, regional director of Calabarzon and Mimaropa, and Marianne Marfori, provincial election supervisor, made the proclamation at the municipal hall after San Pedro residents voted for the cityhood in a plebiscite held on December 28, 2013. "Yes" votes for cityhood totaled 16,996 (which is an additional 50 votes added in some precincts mostly in the San Vicente area to win the "yes" vote), and "no" votes, only 869, in 501 clustered precincts in San Pedro. Only 11% of 165,777 registered voters in San Pedro's 27 barangays took part in the plebiscite.

In 2015, Pimentel filed Senate Bill No. 3029 for the creation of the San Pedro City as a separate district to commence in the next national and local elections.

=== City Seal ===

The City of San Pedro logo represents San Pedro's identity – a Gateway City:

Being the first city of Laguna from Metro Manila, San Pedro is gateway to the Province and likewise to the Calabarzon Region, the country's premier growth area.
Being a pilgrimage tourism destination on account of the miraculous Lolo Uweng Shrine, San Pedro is a place for holiness and religious devotion that can lead the Christian believer to eternal life in God's Kingdom, thus, it is Gateway to Heaven.
San Pedro is named after Saint Peter to whom Christ entrusted the keys to the gates of heaven. Matthew 16:19: ”I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”Shapes and colors
Circles have no beginning nor end. They protect, they endure, they restrict. They confine what's within and keep things out. They offer safety and connection. They suggest community, integrity, and perfection.
White is color at its most complete and pure, the color of perfection. It means purity, innocence, wholeness and completion. White is the base color of the logo.
The Red Circle suggests excitement, energy, passion, love, desire, speed, strength, power, thus contributing to the success of all things intense and passionate.
The Black Circle suggests power, sophistication, formality, and elegance.
The Green Circle suggests balance, growth and self-reliance.
Gold is the color of success, achievement and triumph. It is also associated with abundance and prosperity, luxury and quality, prestige and sophistication, value and elegance. Its color psychology implies affluence, material wealth and extravagance.
Blue stands for peace, tranquility, calm, stability, harmony, unity, trust, truth, confidence, conservatism, security, cleanliness, order, loyalty, sky, water, and technology. It is the color of trust and peace. It can suggest loyalty and integrity.
San Pedro Arch, the logo's main element, reflect the city's status as a gateway to and from Metro Manila, Laguna Province and the whole of Calabarzon.Roosters
These roosters, porched on the Arch, represent the incident where Peter denied Jesus, followed by the crowing of the roosters. The Christian world calls this the Incident of Repentance. For the crowing of the rooster was followed by Saint Peter's bitter cry and plea for forgiveness.Keys
The keys symbolize the power to enter the kingdom of heaven, and Saint Peter holding the keys tightly means he holds the most important thing that leads to heaven, that is Knowledge of God.
The Gold Ancient Keys in the Arch also represent greatness and power, among others. These keys symbolize the city's never-ending quest for opportunities that will contribute to its growth and progress.Sampaguita garland
This symbolizes San Pedro's distinction as the Sampaguita Capital of the Philippines. Some would question this title due to the absence now of a tangible heritage, which are the vast tracks of Sampaguita farms that gave rise to the Sampaguita industry in San Pedro during the olden times. But the claim to this title is justified by the fact that the city still owns the intangible heritage of having the most skillful and most creative makers of Sampaguita products in the country. Moreover, the Sampaguita Festival which is being celebrated annually by San Pedro is the only festival in the country which gives honor and recognition to the national flower.
The twenty Sampaguita buds forming a lei represent the 20 barangays of San Pedro. It also symbolizes unity and harmony among the city constituents. The number of buds may be increased through time should new barangays are created in the future.Sun
This Star is our logo's connection to the Philippine National Flag. Its 8 rays symbolize the 8 provinces (including Laguna) which first revolted against Spanish colonization during the 19th century.Words and date
The words and date of 2013 note the city's status as a component city of the province of Laguna and as part of the number of cities of the Philippines,  as well as the very year of the granting of its city charter. NOTE: Approved by the Sangguniang Panlungsod on February 17, 2014 under Resolution 2014-26 and City Ordinance 2014–10.
