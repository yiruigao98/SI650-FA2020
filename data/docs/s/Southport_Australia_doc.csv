== History ==
Originally known as Nerang Creek Heads, it was named Southport because it was the southernmost port of the colony of Queensland.A settlement was first surveyed in 1874 and the name Southport decided the following year.  Southport was once the site of timber mills. A port was established to ship logs to Brisbane. Cutting timber opened up the area for settlement. Early rural industries included sugar growing and livestock grazing.
Southport Provisional School opened on 17 February 1880. On 1 July 1882 it became Southport State School.

In 1879 the first Congregational services were held in Southport in the home of J. C. Lather conducted by the Reverend J. Whiting who ministered in the Logan and Albert River districts. Land was purchased in Queen Street and a Congregational church was opened there on 9 October 1880. It was used for monthly Congregational services but was also available for use by other denominations. The first minister, Reverend A.R. Bailey was appointed in 1883. A manse was built in Bauer Street. J.B. Evans was the minister from late 1885, being replaced by J. G. Cribb in 1887. In 1888 a new Congregational Church was erected in White Street costing £530 and based on the designs prepared for the Milton Congregational Church in Brisbane. In 1899, the  manse was relocated to behind the White Street church.In 1883, the first Southport Pier was built to allow steamships to bring cargo and passengers to Southport. In the 1880s, Southport became the chosen site for the holiday residence of the Queensland Governor Sir Anthony Musgrave and his wife Lady Musgrave. Known as the Summer Place and still situated on the present day site of The Southport School, the choice of Southport as the preferred holiday destination for one of the most prominent couples in Queensland established the township as Queensland's pre-eminent seaside resort. Following the death of the governor in 1888, the Summer Place continued to be a holiday home for visitors to the area.In 1889 the South Coast railway from Beenleigh to Southport opened. The line was closed in 1964. After the arrival of the rail and prior to the construction of vehicular or pedestrian bridges across the Nerang River, a ferry service run by Johan Meyer ferried passengers to Main Beach, Queensland and a horse and buggy service linked the area to Surfers Paradise.

In April 1900 the Roman Catholic Church purchased a parcel of land for a convent on Marine Parade opposite the pier (27.9655°S 153.4151°E﻿ / -27.9655; 153.4151﻿ (Star of the Sea Convent)). The Star of the Sea College opened as day school on 21 January 1901. Operated by the Sisters of Mercy, there were about 60 students enrolled on the opening day. In 1934, the school commenced offering secondary school education. The school closed at the end of 1990 with the girls transferring to Aquinas Catholic College (previously a boys-only school). The site was sold with buildings being demolished in 2016. The demolition unearthed a time capsule placed in March 1988 as part of the Australian bicentenary celebrations.The Southport School opened in 1901.
Guardian Angels' School opened on 1 January 1901.By 1901 (Federation) Southport was well established as a tourist seaside spot with numerous accommodation options and a permanent population of 1,230. Tourism continued to expand in the first half of the 20th century with Southport maintaining its role as a seaside resort and a popular destination for day trippers and excursionists travelling from Brisbane.St Hilda's School opened in 1912.A concrete jetty was built in 1914 to replace the earlier structure. In 1927, the Pier Theatre which included a cafe and indoor golf course was built on the jetty.  A fire destroyed the structure in 1932 but it was rebuilt and open to the public for nearly forty years.In 1915 163 allotments of "Pacific Ocean Estate" were advertised to be auctioned on 5 April 1915 (Easter Monday) by Newman and Dawber auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states the Estate was 2 miles from Southport Railway station, and near Southport High School.The construction of the Jubilee Bridge in 1925 between Southport and Main Beach replaced the ferry service and facilitated further growth.

On 25 April 1922 (ANZAC Day) Southport War Memorial located at the foot of Nerang Street was dedicated by the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Albert, John Appel, in the presence of many Southport people. In 2010, renovation of the parklands required the relocation of the memorial; it was re-dedicated on 11 November 2010.By the 1950s, Southport was the central entertainment location of the Gold Coast. It was also the administrative centre, with a central business district.
Southport State High School opened on 24 January 1955. Prior to its opening, a secondary department had operated at Southport State School.Circa 1958 All Saints' Anglican Church opened in the Chirn Park neighbourhood. Its closure on 2 November 1997 was approved by Assistant Bishop Williams. The church building was relocated to become the Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd in Mudgeeraba.Gold Coast Opportunity School opened in 1962.

However, it has still experienced tourist-driven development and extraordinary growth. Southport has 18 high-rise towers either completed, under construction or awaiting commencement.


== Landmarks and locations ==

The body of water marking the eastern boundary of present-day Southport is known as the Gold Coast Broadwater. The Broadwater houses the Southport Yacht Club and a number of marinas on the southern bank of the Nerang River in an area now known as Main Beach. The area is used for fishing, boating, and watersports. Located opposite Southport on the far side of the Broadwater on The Spit, is the theme park Sea World. Although the Broadwater water is suitable for swimming, it is only six minutes from Surfers Paradise, which features high quality beaches and infrastructure including a permanent life guard station. The present day southern boundary of Southport is the Nerang River.
On the western side of the Broadwater, is the Southport Broadwater Parklands which opened in 2009  and has undergone subsequent expansions in 2013 and 2016. Within the Parklands precinct are the Southport Pier, Gold Coast Aquatic Centre and the Southport War Memorial. Overlooking the Parklands is Australia Fair Shopping Centre.
Australia Fair Shopping Centre is an indoor shopping centre spreading over Scarborough Street with frontages on Nerang Street and the Gold Coast Highway. Containing 233 stores and a cinema, it was established in 1983, initially on the site of the former milk factory and entirely on the site of the former Pacific Hotel, which was built in 1878, redesigned in 1927 and demolished in 1988 to make way for the expansion of the shopping complex.The western end of Nerang Street in the vicinity of the intersection of Scarborough Street is also known as the Southport Mall. The re-opening of the mall (the old CBD, located adjacent to the shopping centre) to low-speed through traffic, after eight years of closure to vehicles, took place in 2000.At the top of the mall, on the south western intersection of Scarborough and Nerang Streets, is the Art Deco styled Hotel Cecil which is considered an 'important anchor' in the streetscape. Opposite the hotel is a G:link station and, a few metres to the north, is the major northern bus interchange for the Gold Coast.
The City of Gold Coast Southport Branch Library is located on the Corner of Garden and Lawson Streets. It was previously located on the top floor of the Australia Fair Shopping Centre. The Southport Branch Library was completed in 2002 and is one of 14 branches of the city's library. Upstairs, in the same building, is the Local Studies Library which includes the city's historical collection of materials including documents, photographs, films, advertising and memorabilia.St Hilda's School, which was founded in 1911, is located opposite the hospital and is the only all-girls school on the Gold Coast.  Southport is home to The Southport School, which was once the largest boarding school in Queensland. The school was founded in 1901 and has a well-known clock tower and chapel. It is also one of the few schools in Australia where cadet service is mandatory.Located on Nind Street, the Sata Nita building built in 1936 by Ralf Tennant Johnston, is now home to a funeral business. It was built as a bridal suite ahead of Ralf's marriage to his bride to be, Lila Hughes. Today it known as one of Southport’s oldest and quirkiest buildings.In April 2009, the three-tower Southport Central development was opened.In 2014, the Gold Coast City Council, in an effort to revitalise and solidify Southport as the Central Business District for the Gold Coast, opened its own Chinatown.
The Sundale Shopping Centre, which opened on 26 March 1969, was the first of its kind on the Gold Coast costing a record $7.5 million but closed in 1989 after the larger Australia Fair Shopping Centre opened nearby. It was located on 5 hectares (12 acres) of prime real estate facing the Broadwater which was previously the site of the popular Southport Hotel which was originally constructed in 1876.As well as providing panoramic views of the Nerang River from the upper floor, it was home to Queensland's first Big W department store as well as a cinema, restaurants, 45 speciality stores and a 7,000-vehicle car park. It was proposed as a location for the building of the Gold Coast Convention Centre. Such a development would have rejuvenated the old administrative centre of the Gold Coast. However, it lost its bid to Broadbeach, in part because of a lack of tourist accommodation in Southport.The site hosted weekly markets throughout the 1990s for several years after its closure, until its eventual demolition in 2003, at which time a time capsule was buried where the popular mall once stood. The area is now home to the Meriton Brighton on Broadwater development, a mix of high and low-rise buildings together with trendy eateries and some retail outlets. In more recent years another a time capsule was discovered on the Sundale site which was buried when the mall was originally constructed. It was originally meant to be opened in the 2000s and was filled with notes and items which were meant to predict what the 21st century would be like. It is now located in the Gold Coast City Council Local Studies Library.
