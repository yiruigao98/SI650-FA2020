== History ==
1837 - Dakota and Ojibwe Indians once inhabited the area that is now Shoreview.  Indian mounds containing human bone 
fragments, arrowheads, pieces of pottery, and bits of charcoal have been found on Rice Creek near the north shore of 
Long Lake in nearby New Brighton and in parts of Shamrock Park.  In 1837 the land lying between the St. Croix and Mississippi Rivers, including what is now Shoreview, was ceded to the United States Government by the Ojibwe.
1850 - In February 1850, Socrates A. Thompson, accompanied by an Indian friend, left Saint Paul in search of a good location 
for farming.  Thompson was the first white person to settle on land that is now within the boundaries of the city of 
Shoreview.  Soon people from Switzerland, England, Ireland, Germany, Vermont, Virginia, Illinois and New York 
began farming in Shoreview.  A well traveled wagon trail passed through Shoreview, with the current location of Shamrock Park being a popular resting place for travelers.
1858 - At one time, Shoreview was part of the former Mounds View Township.  The name came from a range of hills running through 
the center of the township.  Mounds View Township was organized on May 11, 1858, the same day that Minnesota 
became a state.
1880 - Later in the 1800s railroad lines expanded to include Shoreview.  The first railroad lines in Shoreview, owned by James "The Puck" McMillan and his Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway (now Soo Lines) were built in the 1880s.
1957 - On March 14, 1957 a group of citizens, feeling the inadequacy of a township government, presented a petition to the 
Ramsey County Board of Commissioners that called for the incorporation of the Village of Shoreview.  This action 
would separate Shoreview from Mounds View Township.  After a bitter dispute, an election was held at the Shamrock Park pavilion and the incorporation of Shoreview was approved by a vote of 853 to 748.
April 23, 1957, Shoreview was officially incorporated. The first Mayor of Shoreview, Kenneth Hanold, was elected 
on May 23, 1957.  At this time, Shoreview had a population of 5,231 and an assessed valuation of $1,884,000. 
(Shoreview now has 26,500 residents and $3.1 billion in total property value.) The first elected officers met in a small 
outbuilding on Willis Wilson's property (County Road I). A few weeks later they moved into an office on the second 
floor of Mayor Hanold's garage (Rice Street and Interstate 694).
When questions arose about renting property from a mayor, a search was conducted to look for another space. Between 1957 and 1973, Village Hall was housed first in a former barn (Highway 96) from which the second floor had been removed. The next Village Hall, also located on Highway 96, was a small house which had been repaired following an explosion.  At this time, Shoreview's governing was being done from a restored house and a converted barn near Shamrock Park.
1963 - December 10, 1963, Interstate Highway 694 was opened through Shoreview. The three broadcast towers, located on the north side of Highway 694, were constructed in the early 1970s and have become familiar landmarks in Shoreview and are the tallest structures in Minnesota.
Citizens worked to change the form of government, and on November 5, 1963, in order to better deal with the village's growing population, the citizens of Shoreview voted to shift to a “Plan A” form of government under which the village clerk and treasurer were appointed rather than elected.
1973 - July 17, 1973 community leaders decided it was time to build a City Hall.  A referendum was passed by a single vote and a structure was built.  This was the site of Shoreview's government until 1990 when the City Hall and Community Center opened at Shoreview Commons.
1974 - Shoreview changed forms of government once again and became a city on January 1, 1974 through an act of the State Legislature.  With a population of over 14,000 at the time, the residents voted in November 1974 to adopt the present “Plan B” Council-Manager form of government.
2007 - Shoreview celebrated its golden anniversary with a ceremony at Shamrock Park recognizing residents living in the community since its incorporation.
2011 - Shoreview Maintenance Center renovated/received the LEED Gold Certification by the Green Building Council. This was the first in the nation to be certified under the 2009 LEED rating system and only the fifth city facility in the state to be LEED certified.  Mayor Martin received the C.C.Ludwig Award for outstanding service and leadership from the League of Minnesota Cities.
