== History ==

Fort Mont-Valérien (Mémorial de la France Combattante) is situated in the commune, as is Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial. Suresnes has a beautiful view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower.
In 1974 the Spanish Socialist Workers Party held its 26th Congress in Suresnes (it was illegal in Spain under Franco). Felipe González was elected Secretary General, replacing Rodolfo Llopis Ferrándiz. González was from the "reform" wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who had not fought in the Spanish Civil War.


== Transport ==
Suresnes is served by Suresnes–Mont-Valérien station on the Transilien La Défense and Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail lines. It is also served by Île-de-France tramway Line 2, which stops twice in the commune, at Belvédère and Suresnes Longchamp.
The Pont de Suresnes carries the Allée de Longchamp, one of the main traffic arteries, from the Bois de Boulogne over the Seine into the western suburbs of Paris.
