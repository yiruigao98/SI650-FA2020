== History ==
Evidence of pre-Columbian presence has been found in the Gruta Rei do Mato (Cave of the Forest King).
From around 1700, colonists entered Minas Gerais in search of gold, gems and diamonds. Nowadays, the Santa Luzia quarter is unofficially still called "o garimpo" (meaning "the goldmine").
Between 1780 and 1867, the name 'Sete Lagoas' was used for several regional types of administrations. The municipality of Sete Lagoas was founded in 1867.
Although "Sete Lagoas" means "Seven Lakes", there are currently more than seven lakes in Sete Lagoas (10 within the urban perimetre, 17 in the municipality). Some were dug out while others became part of the town when the town expanded. There are, however,  7 'official' lakes according to a municipal law from 1989. These are: Lagoa da Boa Vista, Lagoa da Catarina, Lagoa da Chácara, Lagoa do Cercadinho, Lagoa José Felix, Lagoa do Matadouro and Lagoa Paulino.


== Food ==
Food is an important element of the culture of Minas Gerais. In Sete Lagoas, two dishes can be found that are hardly found elsewhere: Galopé and Muchacho. Galopé is a dish of chicken (galo) and pork feet (pé de porco). Muchacho is also composed of chicken and pork but it also contains cheese.

Democrata Futebol Clube is a football club based in Sete Lagoas. The club plays its home matches at the Arena do Jacaré ("Alligator Arena", so named because of Democrata's mascot; the official name is Joaquim Henrique Nogueira stadium).
Both teams used to play the traditional "sete-lagoano" derby being a very famous and known as the "Clássico dos sertões" ( Countryside's Derby ). An interesting fact about both was its old home arenas: it was only one block distance from each, which was an extra spice for the rivality. The old Democrata's Arena was demolished, but the original and glorious BV arena is still there.
In 2010 and 2011, Arena do Jacaré served as a home stadium for Atlético Mineiro, Cruzeiro and América-MG,  as both Belo Horizonte stadia - Mineirão and Independência - were going through reforms.
