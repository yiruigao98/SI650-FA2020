The lowest level of census-designated places in Greece are called oikismoi (settlements) and are the smallest continuous built-up areas with a toponym designated for the census. Although some urban CDPs form individual cities and towns (labeled in bold) the majority of them do not. They are either what make up the central districts, or suburbs (italicized), contained within the wider urban and metropolitan areas of Athens and Thessaloniki.
