The province of Punjab, the most populous province of Pakistan and the second-largest province by area, is divided into 36 districts and nine divisions. Below, you will find an overview of the recent history of districts in Punjab, a map showing each district, the divisions of Punjab and their districts, and a list showing each district's name, the division the district belongs to, the district's area, the location of the district's headquarters, the district's population and population density (in 2017), the average annual population growth rate of each district (between 1998 and 2017), and a map showing each district's location.


== History ==


=== Colonial Times ===


==== 1868 - 1881 ====
Districts and Divisions were both introduced in Punjab as administrative units by the British when Punjab became a part of British India, and ever since then, they have formed an integral part in the civil administration of the Punjab (this region today also covers parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the entire Islamabad Capital Territory, and parts of the Indian States of Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab). At the time of Punjab's second census, which took place in 1868, the Punjab was divided into 32 districts, under 10 divisions. The administrative setup of the region was as follows (districts and divisions which do not exist anymore are and are in Pakistani Punjab are in red writing, districts and divisions which were (at least mostly) given to India during the Partition of India are in orange writing, districts and divisions which are (at least mostly) currently in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province are in green writing, and districts and divisions which have been renamed and are in Pakistani Punjab are in blue writing):

==== 1901 - 1911 ====
Between 1901 and 1911, many changes occurred to Punjab's administrative map. On 25 October 1901, after the 1901 census was taken, the Punjab province was divided into two separate entities: Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province. The North-West Frontier Province consisted of the three districts of Hazara, Kohat, and Peshawar, the Bannu and Marwat Tehsils of Bannu District (which then became Bannu District), and the Dera Ismail Khan, Kulachi, and Tank Tehsils of Dera Ismail Khan District (which then became Dera Ismail Khan District). The tehsils of Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu Districts which were not placed into the North-West Frontier Province became Mianwali District, placed in Multan Division. In 1904, Attock District was created out of parts of Rawalpindi District and Jhelum District, and Lyallpur District was created out of parts of Gujranwala, Jhang, and Montgomery Districts. In 1909, Montgomery District transferred from Lahore Division to Multan Division, and Mianwali District transferred from Multan Division to Rawalpindi Division. This all meant that at the time of Punjab's 1911 Census, Punjab had 29 districts split among 5 divisions. The administrative setup of the region was as follows (districts and divisions which do not exist anymore are and are in Pakistani Punjab are in red writing, districts and divisions which were (at least mostly) given to India during the Partition of India are in orange writing, and districts and divisions which have been renamed and are in Pakistani Punjab are in blue writing):

==== 1911 - 1947 ====
In late 1911, the imperial capital of British India was moved from Calcutta (today Kolkata) to Delhi. The district was reorganized as its own province that year, decreasing the number of districts in Punjab to 28. After the creation of Delhi Province, Delhi Division went by the name "Ambala Division". In 1919, Sheikhupura District was created from parts of Gujranwala and Lahore Districts and placed in Lahore Division. This meant that the number of districts and divisions in the province was the same in 1921 as it was in 1911, except Ambala Division was one district smaller and Lahore Division was one district larger, although Lahore Division hadn't changed much in area and population. The administrative setup of Punjab was as follows (districts and divisions which do not exist anymore are and are in Pakistani Punjab are in red writing, districts and divisions which were (at least mostly) given to India during the Partition of India are in orange writing, and districts and divisions which have been renamed and are in Pakistani Punjab are in blue writing):

=== Post-Independence ===


==== 1947 - 1954 ====
At the time of the Partition of India, Punjab was split religiously. As of the 1941 census, Punjab had a population that was 53.22% Muslim (mostly concentrated in the Western regions of the province), 29.11% Hindu (mostly concentrated in the Eastern regions of the province), and 14.91% Sikh (mostly concentrated in the center of the province, around Amritsar and Lahore). Because of this divide, Punjab was split into East Punjab, which would have a Hindu/Sikh majority and would be placed in India, and West Punjab, which would have a Muslim majority and would be placed in Pakistan. The line dividing the two was placed by Cyrial Radcliffe, and the line he drew would come to be known as the Radcliffe line.In the partition, Multan Division and Rawalpindi Division, which were 75.43% and 85.52% Muslim respectively, were entirely given to Pakistan. Each district and each tehsil in both of these divisions had a proportion of Muslims over 50%.Ambala Division was given to India, being only 28.07% Muslim. Every district in Ambala Division had a non-Muslim majority, and all tehsils but two had non-Muslim majorities (Ferozpur Jhirka and Nuh Tehsils in Gurgaon District had Muslim proportions of 78.79% and 57.88% respectively, but they were very far from all the other Muslim majority districts and tehsils in the Punjab, being next to Delhi).Jalandhar Division was entirely given to India as well, and each of its districts had a non-Muslim majority. Four Tehsils in this division, though, Ferozpur (55.25% Muslim) and Zira (65.26% Muslim) Tehsils in Ferozpur District, and Jalandhar (51.16% Muslim) and Nakodar (59.41% Muslim) Tehsils in Jalandhar District all had Muslim majorities and bordered Pakistan.In Lahore Division, Gujranwala (70.45% Muslim), Sheikhupura (63.62% Muslim), and Sialkot (62.18% Muslim) Districts were all entirely given to Pakistan. In these three districts, each tehsil also had a Muslim majority. Amritsar District (46.52% Muslim) was entirely given to India, despite having one tehsil (Ajnala Tehsil at 59.46% Muslim) bordering other Muslim-majority tehsils and districts that was also Muslim-majority. Lahore District and Gurdaspur Districts, both Muslim majority (60.62% Muslim and 51.14% Muslim respectively) were the only two districts in Punjab that were split. In Gurdaspur District, which had four tehsils, three tehsils were majority Muslim (Batala, Gurdaspur, and Shakargarh Tehsils at 55.07%, 52.16%, and 51.32% Muslim respectively) and one tehsil was majority non-Muslim (Pathankot Tehsil at 38.89% Muslim). One tehsil in Gurdaspur District, Shakargarh Tehsil, was given to Pakistan and placed in Sialkot District, and the other three tehsils were all given to India despite forming a contiguous boundary. Lahore District had three tehsils, Chunian, Lahore and Qasur, all of which were Muslim majority (60.85%, 62.12%, and 57.19% Muslim respectively). While Chunian and Lahore Tehsils were entirely given to Pakistan, Qasur Tehsil was divided into two parts, which the larger part going to India. This was under the grounds of "protecting Amritsar city".In the end, fifteen districts of Punjab went entirely to Pakistan, all of which were Muslim majority; twelve districts of Punjab went entirely to India, all of which were non-Muslim-majority, and the two districts of Gurdaspur and Lahore, both of which were Muslim majority, were split between India and Pakistan. At the tehsil level, though, eight Muslim-majority tehsils which were contiguous with Pakistan were given to India, while not a single non-Muslim-majority tehsil was given to Pakistan. This left sixteen districts in Pakistani Punjab, that were split up into three divisions. No changes to this setup had occurred up to the time of the 1951 census (except for Attock District being renamed Campbellpur District). The administrative setup of Pakistani Punjab in 1951 was as follows (districts and divisions which do not exist anymore are in red writing, and districts and divisions which still exist, but have been renamed are in blue writing):
Lahore Division
Gujranwala District
Lahore District
Sheikhupura District

Gujrat District
Jhelum District
Mianwali District
Rawalpindi District
Shahpur District


==== 1954 - 1972 ====
In 1954, the One Unit policy that consolidated all of West Pakistan into one province began. From 1954 - 1970, the province of West Punjab ceased to exist, never to return. The death of the province brought the rise of divisions as the primary form of organizing Pakistan's districts, instead of provinces. The area covering former West Punjab, though, kept the same districts and divisions through 1961 (and the 1961 census) as it did in 1951.The One Unit policy ended in 1970 and provinces returned once again, but when West Punjab was reorganized, it was renamed Punjab and the area which earlier housed the Princely State of Bahawalpur (which, during One Unit, was made into a division and split into the three districts of Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar Khan) was absorbed into the province.By the time of the 1972 Census of Pakistan, many changes had been made to the administrative map:Between 1961 and 1972, Shahpur District was abolished, and Sargodha District took its place, covering the area once occupied by Shahpur District. The headquarters of this new district were placed at the city of Sargodha;Between 1961 and 1972, Punjab gained another division with the formation fo Sargodha Division. Sargodha Division was composed of Mianwali and Sargodha Districts (both formerly in Rawalpindi Division) and Faisalabad and Jhang Districts (both formerly in Multan Division);In 1966, Montgomery District was renamed Sahiwal District, at the same time of the city of Sahiwal's renaming;This all meant that by the time of the 1972 Census, Punjab was divided into five divisions covering nineteen districts. The administrative setup of Punjab province in 1972 was as follows: (districts and divisions which still exist, but have been renamed are in blue writing)
Bahawalpur Division
Bahawalnagar District
Bahawalpur District
Rahim Yar Khan District
Lahore Division
Gujranwala District
Lahore District
Sheikhupura District
Sialkot District
Multan Division
Dera Ghazi Khan District

Sahiwal District
Rawalpindi Division
Campbellpur District
Gujrat District
Jhelum District
Rawalpindi District
Sargodha Division

Lyallpur District
Mianwali District
Sargodha District


==== 1972 - 1981 ====
New administrative districts kept being carved up and renamed between 1972 and the year of the next census, 1981.
In 1976, the tehsils of Chunian and Qasur were separated from Lahore District to form Qasur District, which was placed in Lahore Division;In the same year, the tehsils of Vehari and Malisi in Multan District, and a group of four "qanungo circles" in Sahiwal District's Pakpattan Tehsil were reorganized into their own district, called Vehari District. Vehari District was placed in Multan Division;In 1977, Lyallpur District was renamed Faisalabad District, at the same time of the city of Faisalabad's renaming;In 1978, Campbellpur District was renamed Attock District, at the same time of the city of Attock's renaming;by the time of the 1981 Census, Punjab was divided into five divisions covering 21 districts. The administrative setup of Punjab province in 1981 was as follows:
Bahawalpur Division
Bahawalnagar District
Bahawalpur District
Rahim Yar Khan District
Lahore Division
Gujranwala District
Lahore District
Qasur District
Sheikhupura District
Sialkot District
Multan Division
Dera Ghazi Khan District

Vehari District
Rawalpindi Division
Attock District
Gujrat District
Jhelum District
Rawalpindi District
Sargodha Division
Jhang District
Sahiwal District
Mianwali District
Sargodha District


==== 1981 - 1998 ====
This administrative setup did not last long, and by the time of the 1998 Pakistan Census, over a dozen new districts and three new divisions had been created.Sometime between the censuses of 1981 and 1998, the districts of Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Sialkot were removed from the divisions of Rawalpindi and Lahore and were organized into the newly created Gujranwala Division.Sometime between the censuses of 1981 and 1998, the districts of Dera Ghazi Khan and Muzaffargarh were removed from Multan Division and were organized into the newly formed Dera Ghazi Khan Division.Sometime between the censuses of 1981 and 1998, the districts of Faisalabad and Jhang were removed from Sargodha Division and were organized into the newly formed Faisalabad Division.Sometime between the censuses of 1981 and 1998, Pakpattan District was created out of Sahiwal District's Pakpattan Tehsil. Pakpattan District was kept in Multan Division.In 1982, Bhakkar District was formed out of Mianwali District's Bhakkar Tehsil. Bhakkar District was kept inside Sargodha Division.In 1982, Khushab District was formed out of most of Sargodha District's Khushab Tehsil. Khushab District was kept inside Sargodha Division.In 1982, Layyah District was formed out of Muzaffargarh District's Layyah Tehsil. Layyah District was a part of Dera Ghazi Khan Division.In 1982, Okara District was formed out of the two tehsils of Depalpur and Okara inside Sahiwal District. Okara District was placed inside Lahore Division by the time of the 1998 census.In 1982, Rajanpur District was carved out of Dera Ghazi Khan District's two tehsils of Jampur and Rajanpur, as well as some union councils in Dera Ghazi Khan's de-excluded area, which then became the Rajanpur de-excluded area. This district was a part of Dera Ghazi Khan Division.In 1982, Toba Tek Singh District was formed out of Faisalabad District's Toba Tek Singh Tehsil and a few Union Councils in Jhang District. Toba Tek Singh District was inside Faisalabad Division by the time of the 1998 census.In 1985, Chakwal District was formed out of most of Attock District's Talagang Tehsil, Jhelum District's Chakwal Tehsil, and a few more union councils inside Jhelum District. Chakwal District was kept in Rawalpindi Division.In 1985, Khanewal District was created out of two tehsils in Multan District: Kabirwala and Khanewal. Khanewal District was kept inside Multan Division.In 1991, Lodhran District was formed out of Multan District's Lodhran Tehsil. It was kept inside Multan Division.In 1991, Narowal District was formed out of the two tehsils of Narowal and Shakargarh inside Sialkot District. Narowal District was inside Gujranwala District by the time of the 1998 census.In 1993, Hafizabad District was formed out of Gujranwala District's Hafizabad Tehsil. Hafizabad District was inside Gujranwala Division by the time of the 1998 census.In 1993, Mandi Bahauddin District was formed out of Gujrat District's Phalia Tehsil. Mandi Bahauddin District was inside Gujranwala Division by the time of the 1998 census.All this meant was that by the time of the 1998 Census of Pakistan, the province of Punjab was administratively divided into 34 districts inside eight divisions. The administrative setup of Punjab was as follows:
Bahawalpur Division
Bahawalnagar District
Bahawalpur District
Rahim Yar Khan District
Dera Ghazi Khan Division
Dera Ghazi Khan District
Layyah District
Muzaffargarh District
Rajanpur District

Sargodha District


==== 1998 - Present ====
In August 2000, all of the divisions throughout Pakistan were abolished, but were reinstated in their exact previous forms eight years later after the elections of 2008, with one exception. Upon restoration, Sahiwal Division was created, being formed out of Okara, Pakpattan, and Sahiwal Districts in Lahore and Multan Divisions.In July 2005, the tehsils of Nankana Sahib and Safdarabad were separated from Sheikhupura District and became Nankana Sahib District, the province's 35th district. In January 2008, though, the Safdarabad Tehsil was given back to Sheikhupura District. Punjab got its 36th district in February 2009, when the Chiniot Tehsil, which was before a part of Jhang District, was upgraded and given the status of a district. This raised the total number of districts in Punjab to 36.This meant that by the time of the 2017 Census of Pakistan, the province of Punjab had 36 districts (two more than in 1998) organized into nine divisions. You can find a list of them below:

== Current Map ==


== Divisions of Punjab, Pakistan ==
In Pakistan, the division is the administrative unit which is higher in hierarchy than a district, but lower in hierarchy than a province. There are seven divisions in Punjab, each of which have anywhere between three and six districts. They are separated by color on the map above, and you can find a list of them below ordered by alphabetical order.


== List of Districts ==
Below you will find a list of all 36 districts in the province of Punjab, along with the division it belongs to, the area of the district, the population and population density of the district, the average annual population growth rate of each district (between 1998 and 2017), and a map showing its location. The districts are initially listed in alphabetical order, but they can be sorted in different ways by clicking the headers of the table.

== Notes ==
A. ^  The area and population density figures displayed in the table above for Lahore District and Qasur District refer to the areas of the two districts in 1998. The borders of the districts were slightly modified between 1998 and 2017, though, with Union Councils that housed 21,369 people in 1998 being transferred from Qasur District to Lahore District. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics has not published any district-wise area figures, however, since the 1998 census. Because of this, the area-wise figures from the 1998 census are rounded to the nearest hundred kilometers (as 21,369 people make up less than 1% of the population of either district which suggests only a very small amount of Union Councils covering a small amount of area were traded) and used to calculate population density figures up to two significant digits.B. ^  The area and population density figures for Nankana Sahib District and Sheikhupura District cannot be determined due to the case of Safdarabad Tehsil, which originally was a part of Nankana Sahib District upon its creation in 2005, but was later trifurcated into Sangla Hill Tehsil, Shahkot Tehsil, and a smaller Safdarabad Tehsil. The smaller Safdarabad Tehsil was given back to Sheikhupura District in 2008, but no area figures on any Tehsils or Districts in Pakistan have been calculated by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics since 1998, meaning that area and population density figures for these three Tehsils are not available, and thus the exact areas of Nankana Sahib District and Sheikhupura District are not available and cannot be calculated.
