== History ==
In 1934 Custódio Vêncio, from Minas Gerais, arrived in the region and bought a large area of land in the region of Buriti Alegre.  He attracted other ranchers to the area and soon there was a settlement called Santa Helena.  In 1941 the town began to be built with lots demarcated on land donated by Vêncio.  In 1943 the name was changed to Ipeguari, meaning "happy field", in homage to the stream called Campo Alegre that flowed through the region.  In 1948, when the city became a municipality, the name reverted to Santa Helena de Goiás by popular acclaim.
