== History ==

Archaeological research has shown that the area around Spijkenisse has been inhabited for many thousands of years. The people then depended on fishing on the Meuse and hunting in the swamps.
The oldest reference to the name Spickenisse is from a source from 1231. This name comes from the words spieke (spit) and nesse (nose) meaning "pointy nose" in reference to a spit of land protruding along the river.Spijkenisse formed as a farming and fishing village at a creek along the Oude Maas. Initially it belonged to the Lord of Putten (whose coat of arms is now used by the city) but in 1459 the fiefdom Putten, including Spijkenisse, was transferred to Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. In 1581, after the Dutch declaration of independence, the area came under the control of the States of Holland and West Frisia.In the 16th century the village suffered several floods. In the 17th and 18th centuries it endured destructive fires which hampered its economic growth. In the 20th century, it heavily urbanised as part of the Greater Rotterdam area. Nowadays, Spijkenisse also includes the community of Hekelingen, as well as Den Hoek and Beerenplaat.
