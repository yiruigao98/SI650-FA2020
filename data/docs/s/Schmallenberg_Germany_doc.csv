== History ==

In 1072 a Benedictine monastery of Grafschaft was founded near the Wilzenberg mountain by St. Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne.
 The oldest available documents speaking of a “Town of Schmallenberg” are the archbishop's and the town council's deeds from 1243. There were several causes which let the place of “Smalenburg” (old German, “narrow castle”) receive town rights.
 Before Schmallenberg received town rights, there had been a castle of Schmallenberg which must have been destroyed around 1240. It was owned by the Archbishop of Cologne Conrad of Hochstadt and the Grafschaft Abbey. The Knight Johann Kolve had the order to protect this castle. At this time, there already must have been some kind of settlement around. The archbishop did not consider the destroyed castle as useful any more. Furthermore, the local settlement was unprotected and in a risky situation because of the castle. That is why the archbishop and the Grafschaft Abbey wanted to fortify the place, leaving the old castle outside the town wall.
In 1244 Schmallenberg received town rights and got a mayor and an own council. Johann Kolve, who had recommended this solution, became the commander of the new fortified town. He got 30 shillings every year on St. Martin’s Day as an indemnity, an own property and a judicial immunity was granted. The new Town of Schmallenberg thanked Kolve for its new protecting wall. He did not have to pay taxes and did not have any civic duties.
There is evidence from 1273 and 1292 of blacksmiths working in Schmallenberg and there have been cutlers and trip hammers for a long time. The town joined alliances with Medebach, Hallenberg and Winterberg and was a member of the Hanseatic League. It used to be a Colognian minting place in the 13th century. After weapon techniques had changed and to the archbishop, Schmallenberg had lost its fortified status, the town went through an economical crisis in the 16th century.
In 1812, the wall and its gates were torn down. In the last of the three big fires of 1732, 1746 and 1822, 131 of 151 houses burnt down and Schmallenberg was rebuilt in the now characteristic structure (“Prussian ladder system”) with its half-timbered houses and slated roofs.
 In 1800, the town's iron manufacturing industry was the second largest in the whole Duchy of Westphalia. Major competition and high costs led to the decline of the industry, and a shift towards textile manufacturing in Schmallenberg. By 1871, there were seven companies belonging to textile industry. Textile manufacturing remained the most important business type for the following years.

Since the 19th century Schmallenberg traditionally was one of the Sauerland's centers of textile industry. The largest company today is the Falke company.
