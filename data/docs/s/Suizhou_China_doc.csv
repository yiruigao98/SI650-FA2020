Suizhou has a long history. During the Spring and Autumn Period and Warring States Period (771−221 BCE), it was the territory of the State of Sui/Zeng and within the cultural sphere of the State of Chu. As a prefecture-level city Suizhou has a short history with its current status only granted by the State Council in June 2000.

The Catholic minority is pastorally served by its own (dormant?) pre-diocesan Apostolic Prefecture of Suixian (隨縣) which is exempt, i.e. directly dependent on the Holy See (and its missionary Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples), not part of any ecclesiastical province.
It was established on 1937.06.17 as Apostolic Prefecture of Suixian (隨縣) / Suihsien / Suihsienen(sis) (Latin adjective), on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Hankou (漢口).
It is vacant since 1951, without apostolic administrator since 1981, having had only the following incumbents :

Father Patrick Maurice Connaughton (龔成德), Friars Minor (O.F.M.) (born Ireland) (1937.06.17 – retired 1951.03), died 1967
Apostolic Administrator Friar Dominic Chen Te-mien, O.F.M. (1951.04.05 – 1981), no ther Ordinariate.
