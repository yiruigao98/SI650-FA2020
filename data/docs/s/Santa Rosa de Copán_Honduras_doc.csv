A tobacco industry developed in the early 18th Century and in 1765 the town was picked as the site for La Real Factoria del Tabacos, the Royal Tobacco Company, a Spanish crown company. Later, the Gracias a Dios Department was split in two departments, becoming Copán department and Lempira department.
