In 1530 there was an eruption of the San Martín Volcano, which prompted the movement of people from Ixtlán to what is now the city of San Andrés Tuxtla, then called Tuzacoalco (land between the mountains). The settlement was recognized in 1580 by the head of the Tlacotalpan, Tuztla and Cotaxtla region.Its tobacco history began in 1830 when a slow influx of Cubans and Europeans made their way here and decided that the climate was apt for the growing of fine tobacco. Today, the area produces some of the finest cigars in the world.  Just prior to the Mexican Revolution the industry experienced strikes by workers, with the first occurring at the El Destino factory in 1896.The municipality was defined in 1825 and in 1826 the city was declared its seat.
