The St Kilda Football Club, nicknamed the Saints, is an Australian rules football club based in Melbourne, Victoria. The club plays in the Australian Football League, the sport's premier league.
The club's name originates from its original home base in the bayside Melbourne suburb of St Kilda in which the club was established in 1873. The club also has strong links to the south-eastern suburb of Moorabbin, where it was based between 1965 and 2010.
St Kilda were a foundation team of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and later, in 1897, became a foundation team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), which later became known as the Australian Football League (AFL) in 1990. The Saints field teams in the AFL Women's and VFL Women's competitions, and are in an alignment with the Sandringham Football Club in the Victorian Football League.
St Kilda have won a single premiership to date, a famous one-point win in the 1966 VFL Grand Final. St Kilda most recently won the minor premiership in the 2009 AFL season and were grand finalists in 2009 and 2010.
St Kilda developed a reputation as perennial underachievers, much of this attributed to their record of finishing last more often than any other club in the league (27 times), as well as having the second lowest all-time win percentage of any team still playing in the league.


== History ==


=== 1873–1915: Early years ===


==== 1873: Establishment ====
On 14 March 1873 a meeting was held in Windsor to form the St Kilda Football Club. At this meeting a provisional committee of men were elected. The formation was completed on 2 April 1873. On 11 June 1873 another meeting was held to appoint the final committee. In March 1888 a decision was made to amalgamate St Kilda with nearby Prahran Football Club. St Kilda retained their colours, name and ground as well as picking up a number of Prahran players. St Kilda competed as a senior club in the VFA from 1877 to 1879, 1881 to 1882 and 1886 to 1896 before moving into the breakaway competition, the Victorian Football League, from 1897 onwards.


==== 1897: Joining the VFL ====

St Kilda were one of the eight clubs that took part in the inaugural VFL season in 1897. They made their debut in an away game against Collingwood on 8 May 1897, which they lost 2.4. (16) to 5.11. (41).
The club's home ground in the new league was the Junction Oval ( until 1964 ) in the suburb of St Kilda in Melbourne and the club's first home game was against Fitzroy. The score was St Kilda 3.8. (26) to 10.6. (66).
St Kilda's early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).In 1902, Charlie Baker became the first St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals.


==== 1907: First finals series ====
Six successive wins at the start of the 1907 season saw St Kilda make the finals for the first time, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses.
St Kilda were beaten by Carlton in their first VFL final by 56 points. They qualified in third position again in 1908 and were once again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals, this time by 58 points.


==== 1913: First grand final ====

The 1913 season saw major improvement in which the team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the 1913 grand final by Fitzroy. At the time a challenge system was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series if it was not the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against South Melbourne and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda – the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point – and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43).
Due to World War I the St Kilda Football Club was in recess in 1916 and 1917 but resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position but were eliminated by Collingwood in a semi final by nine points, 58 to 49.


=== 1918–1939: Between the wars ===


==== 1925: First Brownlow medallist ====
Colin Watson became the first St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal.
The following years saw St Kilda establish itself as a more consistently competitive club. They made the finals in 1929 and were eliminated once again by Carlton, 12.9 (81) to 11.7 (73) in the semi-finals.


==== 1930s ====
In 1936, Bill Mohr became the second St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season.
Bill Mohr kicked 101 goals in 1936 and was the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season.
The mid-1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making it in 1939 by qualifying fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and five losses.  The team had its first finals win since 1913, against Richmond, but were eliminated in the 1939 finals series by Collingwood in the preliminary final.


=== 1940s and 1950s ===
St Kilda won three of the first four games early in the 1940 season and were on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Although there were some prominent players like Harold Bray, Keith Drinan, Peter Bennett and later Neil Roberts, St Kilda were rarely competitive in the 1940s. The 1950 season saw St Kilda win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. In 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, Alan Killigrew was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the largest clean-outs of players in the history of any VFL club. It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, with 11 new players appearing in the club's opening match of 1956.
In 1956 Bill Young became the third St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 56 goals.


==== 1957–1959: Consecutive Brownlow medallists ====
In 1957, Brian Gleeson became the second St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal.
In 1958, Neil Roberts became the third St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.
Also in 1958, St Kilda won the Consolation Night Series competition, a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.
In 1959, Verdun Howell became the fourth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Howell had tied with Bob Skilton in the 1959 Brownlow Medal count. At the time Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back – with Howell receiving a Brownlow retrospectively.
In 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, Allan Jeans was appointed coach. St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939, qualifying third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with fullback Verdun Howell unfit, the club lost to Footscray in the first semi-final.  The club finished ninth in 1962 with nine wins and nine losses.
In 1964, St Kilda were defeated in the final of the Consolation Night Series competition by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73).
St Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins in the last six rounds of the 1963 season to qualify in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers Hawthorn. The club lost to Melbourne in the semi-finals.


=== 1960–1973: Successful era ===


=== Departure from the Junction Oval ===
By the late 1950s, the St Kilda Football Club was seeking to move its playing base away from the Junction Oval, frustrated by disputes and relationships with the St Kilda Cricket Club. In 1959, the club made enquiries about a 50-year lease to play at and develop Elsternwick Park in the neighbouring suburb of Elsternwick, but no deal was signed. In March 1964, the club arranged a deal to move its training and administrative base to the large Moorabbin Oval in Linton St, Moorabbin, approximately 10 km south-east of St Kilda, starting from the 1965 season. The club signed a 75-year lease in August 1964 for controlling occupancy of the venue, and established a social club on the site. The move cost the local Moorabbin Football Club its place in the Victorian Football Association.St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at the Junction Oval was the Round 18 match on 22 August 1964 against Geelong, which St Kilda won 12.18 (90) to 11.12 (78) in front of a crowd of 37,100. Its first home game at Moorabbin was a 6-point win over Collingwood 8.12 (60) d. 8.6 (54) in front of a crowd of 51,370, which is still the ground record for Moorabbin Oval.


=== 1965: First minor premiership ===
St Kilda finished the home and away season a game clear on top with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for a finals series in first position as minor premiers for the first time in the club's history.
St Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season after being beaten by Essendon 14.21 (105) to 9.16 (70) in the 1965 VFL Grand Final.
Ian Stewart became the fifth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Stewart tied on votes with Noel Teasdale of North Melbourne and was awarded the 1965 Brownlow on a count-back.


==== 1966: First premiership ====
1966 saw St Kilda qualify for finals series in consecutive years for the first time since 1907–08. 14 wins and 4 losses in the home and away rounds qualified the club for the finals in second place.
Ian Stewart was the first St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1966 Brownlow Medal with 21 votes. The second consecutive year he won the league's highest individual award and the sixth Brownlow Medal won by a St Kilda player.
St Kilda were defeated by Collingwood in the second semi-final 15. 9. (99) to 13. 11. (89). The club progressed to the 1966 Grand Final after defeating Essendon in the preliminary final 15. 4. (94) to 7. 10. (52).
St Kilda went on to defeat Collingwood in the 1966 VFL Grand Final 10.14 (74) to 10.13 (73), winning the club's first ever premiership.


==== Late 1960s ====
In 1967, Ross Smith became the sixth St Kilda player to win Brownlow Medal.  This was also the third consecutive year that a St Kilda player had won the Brownlow Medal and the second time in the club's history that they had Brownlow Medalists in three consecutive years.
The 1968 season saw St Kilda qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. St Kilda were eliminated by Geelong in the first semi-final.


==== 1970–1973: Consecutive finals series ====
A seventh place home and away season finish in 1969 was followed by another finals appearance in 1970, when St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated South Melbourne in the first semifinal and went on to be eliminated by eventual premiers Carlton in the preliminary final.
St Kilda qualified for the finals series in second place in 1971 at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins.  St Kilda was defeated by Hawthorn by two points in the second semifinal, defeated Richmond in the preliminary final and was defeated in the 1971 VFL Grand Final by Hawthorn.
The club qualified for the finals series again in 1972 in fourth with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final and Collingwood in the first semifinal before being eliminated in the preliminary final by Carlton.
1973 saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth place with 12 wins.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final before being eliminated in the semifinals by Richmond.
1974 saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins.  The club failed to build on competitive seasons in 1975 and 1976. Allan Jeans coaching career at St Kilda ended at the end of the 1976 season after 16 seasons.
1978 began and ended strongly, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. 1979 began well with a win over Hawthorn before a run of defeats and finishing a clear last.  Continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.
In 1987, with Tony Lockett at full forward, St Kilda moved out of the bottom three for the first time since 1982 with nine wins. Tony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season, the fourth St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker award. Lockett became the second St Kilda player to kick more than 100 goals in a season (117).
Lockett also became the seventh St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. He remains the only person in league history to win both the league's best and fairest Brownlow Medal and the league's leading goalkicker Coleman Medal award in the same season. Lockett also won St Kilda's best and fairest award, now called the Trevor Barker Award, and the Leigh Matthews Trophy (players association most valuable player) in the same year. He is the only person in league history to win the Brownlow, Coleman, club best and fairest and Leigh Matthews Trophy in the same year in 1987.


=== 1990–1999 ===
The league was officially renamed the Australian Football League prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.
A competitive 1991 AFL season saw St Kilda qualify for a finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the elimination final.
Tony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season in 1991, the first St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker twice.
Lockett's 118 goals in 1991 was the third year a St Kilda player had kicked more than 100 goals in a season.
In a competitive 1992 season, St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. 
Tony Lockett's 132 goals in 1992 was the fourth year a St Kilda player kicked more than 100 goals in a season.
St Kilda won its first finals series match since 1973, over Collingwood, before being by eliminated from the 1992 finals series by Footscray in the semi-finals.


==== 1992: Last home game at Moorabbin ====
The AFL embarked on a strategy of grounds rationalisation in the early 1990s and, with Moorabbin Oval's facilities ageing, St Kilda opted to take a deal to move home games to Waverley Park from 1993. The club voted in favour of the move in a weighted vote of members and shareholders by a margin of 8750 to 6555 in July 1992.  The club received $430,000 upfront and $120,000 per year for three years from the AFL's grounds rationalisation funds, which helped to clear some of the club's debt. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was the Round 20 match on 1 August 1992, an 18-point win over the Fitzroy Lions in front of 27,736. St Kilda Football Club retained Moorabbin Oval as a training, administration and entertainment venue.


==== 1996: First pre-season cup win ====
St Kilda won the 1996 Ansett Australia Cup competition, the pre-season cup. The team had wins over Hawthorn in the round of 16, Adelaide in the quarter finals, West Coast in the semi-finals and defeated Carlton in the final 20.10 (130) to 10.12 (72) in front of 66,888 people at Waverley Park.
Nicky Winmar became the first St Kilda player to win the Michael Tuck Medal for best player on the ground in the 1996 Ansett Australia Cup Final.


==== 1997: Second minor premiership ====
In the 1997 season, St Kilda qualified for the finals series in first position at the end of the home and away rounds with 15 wins and 7 losses, winning a second minor premiership and the first McClelland Trophy in the club's history.
Robert Harvey became the eighth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.
St Kilda defeated Brisbane in the qualifying finals and North Melbourne in the preliminary finals to move through to the grand final. St Kilda finished second after being beaten in the 1997 AFL Grand Final by Adelaide.


==== 1998–2000 ====
Prior to the start of the 1998 season, St Kilda progressed to the 1998 Ansett Australia Cup final in which they were defeated by North Melbourne.
St Kilda made their best start to a season since 1972 by winning five out of six matches by Round 6. At the half-way mark of the 1998 season, St Kilda had jumped to top spot on the ladder in Round 14 with eleven wins and three losses after defeating the Western Bulldogs in a top of the ladder clash at Waverley Park and were tipped as warm favourites for the premiership. However, the team's performance dramatically faded after going from second place in Round 17 to sixth at the home and away games conclusion in Round 22. During this period St Kilda defeated Geelong in Round 16 and West Coast in Round 21. After qualifying for the finals in consecutive seasons, St Kilda were defeated narrowly by Sydney in the qualifying finals and then eliminated comprehensively by Melbourne in the semi-finals. Consolation for the team's performance that year was Robert Harvey becoming the second St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1998 Brownlow Medal with 32 votes, the highest ever votes at the time. He would also be the second St Kilda player to win consecutive Brownlow Medals and the tenth St Kilda Brownlow Medalist.

1999 – Farewell to Waverley ParkSt Kilda made a good start to the 1999 premiership season after progressing to the top four in Round 10. Their form, however, then faded and by the season's end conclusion they would finish 10th on the ladder. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Waverley Park was the Round 20 match on 14 August 1999, a 25-point loss to North Melbourne which ended their chance at a third consecutive finals campaign in a row since 1997.In 2000, St Kilda moved to a new playing home at Docklands Stadium (currently known by its sponsorship name as Marvel Stadium) whilst maintaining the club's training and administration headquarters at Moorabbin.


=== 2000–2008: From wooden spoon to finals ===


==== 2000–2003 ====
The Saints struggled in the early part of this decade, winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the wooden spoon in 2000. They did not fare well in 2001 or 2002 either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as Justin Koschitzke, Nick Riewoldt, Nick Dal Santo and Brendon Goddard, who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end. They scored a notable five-point victory over the eventual three-time premiers Brisbane in Round 11.


==== 2004: Second pre-season cup win ====

==== 2013–2019: Rebuilding under Watters and Richardson ====

The 2013 season marked a historic moment for the St Kilda Football Club and the AFL with the first home and away season match outside of Australia. The match was held in Wellington, New Zealand, on 25 April (Anzac Day), the day each year on which both Australia and New Zealand commemorate the soldiers from both countries who have fought in conflicts around the world.
The match began in the early evening and was held at Westpac Trust Stadium with the Saints hosting the Sydney Swans. The match was played in frigid and slippery conditions. The Saints lost the match by 16 points.
In Round 23, St Kilda hosted Fremantle in what would be the last game for three 200 game players, Stephen Milne, Jason Blake and Justin Koschitzke. The Saints won by 71 points.

After a close loss to West Coast and a heavy defeat to Adelaide, the Saints managed to upset top eight favourites Essendon by 16 points. Following this, the Saints lost the next 11 games, including losses by over 80 points to Hawthorn, Collingwood, Geelong and Carlton. On 15 July, Lenny Hayes announced that he would retire at the end of the 2014 season. The following weekend, the Saints beat Fremantle by 58 points at Etihad Stadium in the upset of the season. The Saints then lost the remaining five games to end the season with 4 wins and 18 losses as well as their first wooden spoon since 2000. With pick one in the draft, St Kilda selected key forward Patrick McCartin.
In 2015, the club still struggled to compete with the higher echelons of the competition, however, the team still showed its potential with an eleven-goal comeback against the Western Bulldogs a particular highlight, as well as the emergence of key forward Josh Bruce, who finished the year with 50 goals. 2016 saw the club begin to challenge for the top 8, however despite gaining twelve wins (including victories against Geelong and eventual premiers the Western Bulldogs) and the continued development of the club's young stars, St Kilda finished ninth on the AFL ladder, missing the finals on percentage.
In 2017, St Kilda once again challenged for a spot in the top 8, highlighted by their Round 16 victory over eventual premiers Richmond, in which they recorded an 82-point margin at half time, leading 14.8 (92) to 1.4 (10) before running away to a comfortable 21.12 (138) to 10.11 (71) win. However, after a mid season dip in form which saw them lose three games in a row by over six goals to the Sydney Swans (50 points), the Western Bulldogs (40 points) and the Adelaide Crows (57 points), coupled with late season losses to Melbourne and Richmond, St Kilda's finals chances were dismissed, eventually leading to the Saints finishing the season at 11th place on the ladder with 11 wins and 11 losses. 2017 also ended with the retirements of club greats Nick Riewoldt (336 games), Leigh Montagna (282 games) and Sean Dempster (222 games for Sydney and St Kilda).
The 2018 season saw a drastic fall in the club's form, as the Saints tumbled to 16th place on the ladder with four wins and a draw. Increased scrutiny on Richardson as coach saw the club bring experienced assistants Brett Ratten and Brendon Lade to Moorabbin, along with NRL legend Billy Slater in a leadership role. While 2019 started brightly with four wins from the first five games, the Saints eventually suffered a similar dip in form to the previous year, losing 9 of the next 11 matches. After being advised that his contract would not be renewed for 2020, coach Alan Richardson resigned from his position as senior coach. Ratten took over as caretaker coach and, after winning three of the season's last six games, was appointed permanent senior coach in September 2019.


==== 2019-present: Ratten era ====

Despite the coaching change, the Saints ended the 2019 season positively with four high-profile players requesting a trade to the Saints and many discussions held with other players looking to move. During the trade period St Kilda traded a number of picks and acquired Port Adelaide's Dougal Howard and Paddy Ryder, Fremantle's Bradley Hill, Zak Jones from Sydney and Richmond's Dan Butler. Jack Steven, Josh Bruce and Blake Acres were traded to Geelong, Western Bulldogs and Fremantle respectively. The Saints also added to their football department with former player Sean Dempster joining as a fitness coach, while former Hawthorn legend Jarryd Roughead as well as David Rath and Ben Robbins also moved to the club. In the reduced 2020 season, the Saints managed 10 of a possible 17 wins to qualify for their first finals series since 2011.


== Club identity ==
The club's on-field nickname is the "Saints", usage of which dates back to as early as the 1870s. Many clubs' early nicknames were derived from an abbreviation or demonym of the club's suburb, but St Kilda is unique among the AFL clubs in now utilising this as its official nickname. Dating back to as early as the 1890s, and to as late as the 1950s, the "Seagulls" was also in use as a nickname, but this has fallen out of use.


=== Uniforms ===
The original colours of the St Kilda Football Club are red, white and black. In the club's early years, from 1873 to 1896, the players wore a thinly striped red, white and black jumper; the stripes were later widened. In 1915, St Kilda changed its colours to red, yellow and black, to avoid playing in the colours of the German Empire's flag during a war against that country; in honour of allied power Belgium, they played in its flag colours for the remainder of the First World War. In 1923 the club returned to using the club's original colours of red, white and black.
The St Kilda Football Club crest first appeared officially on the jumper in approximately 1933 after existing at the club for quite some time beforehand in basic design form. In 1953 the Saints' jumper took on a "vest" style of the three stripes; red, white and black on the front with the club crest, and a plain black back with white numbers – which is used today. The most common variation on that basic design through the years has been the ribbing area around the sleeves and neck having various alternative designs. For a period from 1997 to 2001, a stylised jumper based on the club crest itself was worn.


==== Evolution ====
Uniforms worn by St Kilda through its history:
The St Kilda jumper has three vertical stripes of red, white and black on the front with the club crest a plain black back with white ribbing and numbers.  The current club sponsors are Dare Iced Coffee & Pepper Money whose logos appear alternating on the front and back of the uniform for home and away games. The clash jumper is very distinct from the home jumper, bearing red, white and black vertical stripes with a white back. The club's current apparel partner is International Sports Clothing.


=== Logos ===
The club has used many logos since it was formed in 1873 for promotional and merchandise purposes. The league did not use official club logos until approximately the 1970s. Prior to the 1970s logos were generally created by clubs and in some cases outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official ( or registered trademarks in some cases ). In the past all the club logos were printed in the same basic design frame ( in the form of a badge or shield shape ) and had each club's individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used several different logos, including some featuring the stick figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Shortly after the league officially changed its name to the AFL prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post.


==== Club crest as the official logo ====
A logo change before the start of the 1995 season saw the club make the decision to use the official club crest – which has been on the club jumper since it was first designed in the 1930s and was already an officially registered trade mark of the club – as the club's official logo in the league. The crest is an iconic feature of the club's jumper – a well-known and recognisable symbol of the club. The crest also includes the club's motto, Fortius Quo Fidelius, which is usually translated as "Strength through loyalty". As with the nickname "Saints" the club crest has no religious associations.


=== Club song ===
The club song is an adaption of "When The Saints Go Marching In". The song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and released as a single. The song was recorded with all copyright and royalty agreements in place and the AFL has permission to broadcast it publicly at each St Kilda match.Until 1964, when St Kilda played at the Junction Oval, the club song at every match was an adaptation of "I Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside". When the club moved to Moorabbin Oval a popular chant called "We are the Saints" was sung by supporters. In the late 1960s "When The Saints Go Marching In" eventually became established as the club song. The tune is used by permission under licence.

=== Training, administration and entertainment facilities ===

St Kilda's primary administrative and training base from the end of the 2010 season to 2019 was a new facility at Belvedere Park in Seaford, approximately 21 kilometers south of Moorabbin Oval. The development was a St Kilda Football Club development in conjunction with the Frankston City Council, the Victorian state government and the AFL. The new facility was completed at a cost of approximately 9.5 million dollars and named the Linen House Centre under a naming rights sponsorship deal.
In 2019 the club relocated back to Moorabin Oval.


=== Moorabbin Oval redevelopment ===
Moorabbin Oval has undergone a two-stage redevelopment, costing approximately 30 million dollars, for the St Kilda Football Club. Stage one was a two part development with the demolishing of the old Drake and Huggins stands.From 2018 the ground has again become the training, entertainment, member and community base for the Saints and the primary community football ground in south-eastern Melbourne region. As part of the development deal the parkland outside the outer side of the oval (behind the old terraces that were on the outer side of the ground) is no longer leased by St Kilda FC and has been released back to the local council. It will serve as the primary home ground for the Sandringham Dragons and the Southern Football League as well as being the administrative centre for football development in the south-east. It is also the main venue for the St Kilda FC women's team.

== Reserves team ==
St Kilda operated its own reserves team from 1919 to 2000. From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition and, from 1992 to 1999, a de facto AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League. St Kilda fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for St Kilda in the lower grade. During that time, the St Kilda reserves team won three premierships (1942, 1943 and 1961). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the St Kilda reserves team competed in the new Victorian Football League in the 2000 season before the team was dissolved at the end of the year.
In 2001, St Kilda entered a reserves affiliation with existing VFL club Springvale (which moved to Cranbourne and was renamed Casey in 2006). Under the affiliation, reserves players for St Kilda played VFL football with Springvale/Casey. The affiliation ended after the 2008 season and St Kilda then entered an equivalent affiliation with Sandringham which it still maintains as of the 2019 season.St Kilda had announced its intention to end its affiliation with Sandringham and re-establish its own reserves team in the VFL from the 2017 season after a redevelopment of Moorabbin Oval was completed; but the club ultimately extended and expanded its affiliation with Sandringham. From 2017, St Kilda has had a greater involvement in the operation of the VFL club and, from 2018, Sandringham plays three games per year at Moorabbin Oval in St Kilda colours.
