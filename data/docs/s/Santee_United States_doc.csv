Santee is a suburban city in San Diego County, California, with a population of 53,413 at the 2010 census.

The city is connected to the coastline by State Route 52, a six-lane freeway that runs from Interstate 5 in La Jolla to State Route 67 in El Cajon. The city is bisected by the San Diego River, a linear greenbelt that includes parks, trails and more than 1,100 acres (450 ha) of natural riparian habitat.


== History ==
The region was the homeland of the Kumeyaay people. These original residents established the village of Sinyeweche on the banks of the San Diego River in the present day Santee area.The city is named after Milton Santee, the second husband of Jennie Blodgett, whose first husband was George A. Cowles, a pioneer rancher and businessperson in the San Diego County area.

Santee Lakes Regional Park and Campground offers 190 acres (77 ha) for fishing, camping, bird watching and picnicking. An unincorporated hiking area just north of Santee is popular for mountain bikers. It has entrances at Prince Valiant Drive and Princess Joann Drive and includes many trails that extend to Poway and Santee Lakes, as well as a boot-shaped rock on a slope, unsurprisingly nicknamed “Boot Rock”. In 2035, a community named Fanita Ranch is expected to be built in that area, requiring Magnolia Avenue and Cuyamaca Street to be extended northbound.
Golf: A local landmark since 1958, the Carlton Oaks Golf Course and resort offers a premier golfing destination. The course was designed by Pete Dye, who was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

The city is bisected by four main thoroughfares: Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road traverse east and west, while Magnolia Avenue and Cuyamaca Street cross north and south. Santee also is the eastern terminus of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) Green Line trolley route, which connects East County to Old Town and downtown San Diego. MTS also provides bus service. Gillespie Field, the oldest and largest of eight commercial aviation airports operated by San Diego County, is located on Santee's southern border with the city of El Cajon. The airport serves as a hub for local businesses. Also, while not public transportation, a classic 1960s or earlier Dodge Dart Coupe is often found street-parked on Cottonwood Avenue between Buena Vista Avenue and Gienke Lane.
