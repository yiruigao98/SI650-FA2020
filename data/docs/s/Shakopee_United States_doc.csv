Shakopee ( SHAH-kə-pee) is a city in and the county seat of Scott County, Minnesota. It is located southwest of downtown Minneapolis. Sited on the south bank bend of the Minnesota River, Shakopee and nearby suburbs comprise the southwest portion of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, the sixteenth-largest metropolitan area in the United States, with 3.6 million people. The population of Shakopee was 37,076 at the 2010 census.The river bank's Shakopee Historic District contains burial mounds built by prehistoric cultures. In the 18th century, Chief Shakopee of the Mdewakanton Dakota established his village on the east end of this area near the water. Trading led to the city's establishment in the 19th century. Shakopee boomed as a commerce exchange site between river and rail at Murphy's Landing.
Once an isolated city in the Minnesota River Valley, by the 1960s the economy of Shakopee was tied to that of the expanding metropolitan area. Significant growth as a bedroom community occurred after U.S. Highway 169 was realigned in 1996 toward the new Bloomington Ferry Bridge.
The city is known for the Valleyfair amusement park and the Canterbury Park racetrack.


== History ==

Burial mounds along the Minnesota River bluff, located within the present-day Veterans Memorial Park, have been dated between 500 and 2,000 years old.Following the Dakota migration from Mille Lacs Lake in the 17th century, several bands of Mdewakanton Dakota settled along the Minnesota River. They continued the mound building tradition. One of these bands was led in the 18th century by the first Chief Shakopee. The original Shakopee acquired his name when his wife, White Buffalo Woman, gave birth to sextuplet boys. Shakopee means "the six." The Ojibwa nation began pushing into Dakota territory and reportedly Shakopee's band skirmished in 1768 and 1775. Shakopee died in 1827 at Fort Snelling.
The second man to be given the name Chief Shakopee was his adopted Ojibwa son, Eaglehead (b. 1794-1857), a twin son born to Ozaawindib, or "Yellowhead." Ozaawindib gave this son to the Dakota, as he had another to take the hereditary chief's role. Explorer Joseph Nicollet recorded that Eaglehead had been chosen in 1838 to lead the band and assume his father's name.By this time, Nicollet referred to the "Village of the Six," a permanent Dakota village south of the river, as acting as a boundary to the Ojibwa. However, historians have since situated it east of the present downtown. He noted the village and locality was commonly called the "village of the prairie" (published as tinta ottonwe). The Shakopee band lived in summer bark lodges and winter tipis. They followed the changes of the season when they planted their cornfields.By the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the Sioux tribe ceded land in 1851 and many relocated to Chief Shakopee II's village. The latter people had moved south to what was later assigned to them as the current Shakopee-Mdewakanton Indian Reservation in nearby Prior Lake. The band swelled to 400 people. Its leadership passed to Shakopee II's son Eatoka (b. 1811-1865). He was called Shakpedan (Little Shakopee/Little Six) at the death of his father.During the Dakota War of 1862, his warriors killed about 800 European-American settlers in an effort to regain their lands. Shakpedan was hanged at Fort Snelling in 1865 for his role in the rebellion.Descendants of the Mdewakanton Dakota placed 572 acres (2.31 km2) of Shakopee land into tribal land trust with the Department of Interior in 2003.Meanwhile, in 1851, Thomas A. Holmes established a trading post west of the Dakota and platted Shakopee Village in 1854, named after Chief Shakopee II. The city quickly grew, incorporating in 1857. It surrendered its charter in 1861 due to conflicts in the Dakota War. As tensions lifted, the city incorporated again in 1870. The western end was left in township status and was renamed as Jackson Township, Minnesota in 1861, likely after President Andrew Jackson.In November of 2017, it was discovered that then Shakopee superintendent Rod Thompson had used the district credit card to make 305 personal purchases, totaling over thirty thousand dollars. He was investigated by the FBI, and was charged with swindling and embezzlement. He resigned from his position as superintendent. He plead guilty to 19 counts of felony theft by swindling and embezzlement. He was sentenced to 24 months in prison, which he began serving in spring of 2019 in a minimum security prison in Duluth. He used the money he embezzled to purchase first class flights, TV's Jewelry, and a pair of $220 red cowboy boots.

== In popular culture ==
Shakopee was mentioned in the 2006 film Cars when the character Minny said she once went to Shakopee for "Crazy Days." The voice actress, Edie McClurg, ad-libbed the city's name into the script. Shakopee does celebrate "Derby Days" named for the horse racing tradition of the city's history, and there may have been a predecessor to it called "Crazy Days." Most likely, however, this is a reference to sidewalk sales, which are common in the Midwest and often have names that include the term "Crazy Days".
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart reported on the women's prison in Shakopee. The story was about the controversy of the fence-less prison and the arguments between citizens wanting or not wanting a fence.
