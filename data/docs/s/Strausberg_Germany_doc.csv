Strausberg (German: [ˈʃtʁaʊ̯sˌbɛʁk] (listen)) is a town in Brandenburg, Germany, located 30 km east of Berlin. With a population of 25,594 it is the largest town in the district of Märkisch-Oderland.


== History ==
Strausberg was founded around 1240 and in 1333 its first town hall was built. Today an historic defensive wall borders the old town. In the 19th century industrialization took place and the town developed a local labour movement, including union structures and a local branch of both the Social Democratic and the Communist Party of Germany. After 1945, the town became part of East Germany. Strausberg was the administrative seat of the Strausberg district until a 1993 merger with Bad Freienwalde and Seelow formed "Märkisch-Oderland" with Seelow becoming the new administrative seat of the district.
