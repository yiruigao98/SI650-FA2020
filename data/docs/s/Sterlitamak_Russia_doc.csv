The city's name comes from the Bashkir language and literally means "mouth of the Sterlya river". The population is 273,486 (2010 Census).


== Geography ==
Sterlitamak is located just south of the geographical center of the Republic of Bashkortostan, 121 kilometers (75 mi) from Ufa. Approximately 50 kilometers (31 mi) to the east of the city are the Ural Mountains; to the west the East European Plain begins. In the vicinity of Sterlitamak (inside the Belaya basin) are the Shikhan Mountains (Yurak Tau, Kush Tau, Shakh Tau, and Tra Tau), which are unique geological formations. In the area of Mount Kush Tau, there are children summer camps and "Shikhany" sanatorium; there is also a ski base on the slope of the mountain.
Originally the town was built in the area between the Ashkadar and Sterlya Rivers. This area is now considered the historical center and is known as the "Old Town". Subsequently, Sterlitamak was built mainly to the west and north.
The Sterlya, which falls into the Ashkadar River to the east, flows through the central part of the city. One train bridge and four regular bridges cross the Sterlya, and another one is under construction. In the southeastern part, the Ashkadar separates Zaashkadarye Microdistrict from the main part of the city. Also, in the east Sterlitamak borders with the Belaya River, which forms the boundary between Sterlitamaksky and Ishimbaysky Districts. In the south, near the heavy machinery factory, the city is bordered by the Olkhovka River, which is also an influx of the Ashkadar.


== History ==
At the beginning of the 18th century a post house ("Holes") was situated on the Ufa-Orenburg road where Sterlitamak now stands. A merchant, Savva Tetushev, by the decree of the Empress Catherine the Great, founded a marina on the river Ashkadar, which after the merger with the post office became known as the "Sterlitamak salt pier".
Sterlitamak was founded in 1766 as a port for the distribution of salt mined up the river. During Pugachev's Rebellion of 1773-1775, Sterlitamak was under the control of insurgents, and was subsequently burned. After the restoration, it became the administrative center of Sterlitamaksky Uyezd, and was subsequently granted town status in 1781.The city grew rapidly during industrialization in the late 19th century. At the time, local landowners established beer brewing, vodka distilling, and leather working industries.
Prior to the abolition of serfdom, the most influential landowners of Sterlitamaksky Uyezd were the Levashovs (from the village of Levashovka, now a part of the city), the Mikhaylovs (from the village of Mikhaylovka; now Mikhaylovka Microdistrict), the Belousovs (from Belousovo, merged into the city in 2001). In the town, there were private companies and a variety of handicraft industries (leather and leather products, flour mill, the production of vodka and beer). Major employers of the city were Usmanov, Bayazitov, and Utyamyshev. After the abolition of serfdom, the city grew significantly in numbers and territory; there were large-scale production enterprises. In 1870, the building of Sterlitamak City Duma was constructed.
After the February Revolution, Sterlitamak Council nationalized banks, the telegraph, and the main industrial enterprises in the city. By the decree of the Central Executive Committee on March 23, 1919, Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (BASSR) was proclaimed, and Sterlitamak became the capital of the autonomy. Later, in 1922, the capital was moved to Ufa as the Soviet government began transforming the town into an industrial center.
Before World War II, Sterlitamak was growing rapidly, mainly due to consolidation of enterprises and the construction of new ones. In 1922, the first power plant was launched, supplying the mills and sawmills with energy. A leather sheepskin factory and sawmill were merged into one large sawmill.
In 1930, Sterlitamaksky District was created (at that time 24,000 people lived in Sterlitamak), and oil started to be extracted in 1932 on its territory. Two towns were established in the vicinity of Sterlitamak to tend to the oil fields—Ishimbay 21 kilometers (13 mi) southeast and Salavat 26 kilometers (16 mi) to the south. At the same time, the railway was laid at Sterlitamak (mainly for freight), and in 1934 the first freight train arrived. In connection with all these changes, the population of the town prior to 1939 increased by 58% and reached 37,900 people.
During the Great Patriotic War, many industries were evacuated to Sterlitamak: soda and cement factories, the "Red Proletarian" factory, Lenin Machine-Tool Plant, Moscow Shoe Factory, and Voronezh State Drama Theater.
In 1960, a telephone relay station was built in Sterlitamak.
The first trolleybus line in BASSR was put into operation in Sterlitamak in 1961. The main reason for this decision was a bad environmental situation in the 1980s. Thus, by the end of 1980, Sterlitamak had appeared in the list of the most polluted cities in the country because of the amount of harmful emissions.
Due to the sharp rise in employment capacity in the city, it was decided to extend the city further to the east, to the Belaya River, and to construct bypass roads for freight transport from the west between Sterlitamak and Salavat. By 1984, the population had reached 237,900.

== Ecology ==
During the 1970s in connection with the bad environment in the city, there were projects to make the city greener. There was even a program in which each student had to plant a tree, and according to former Mayor Spartak Akhmetov, the child who planted a tree in his childhood, will feel responsibility to the problems of pollution of his native city. As a result, by 2007 the number of traditional Russian birch trees increased by 350% and surpassed even Samara that has a million population.
In 1987, the Council of Ministers of the USSR passed a decision to improve the ecological situation in the city. Currently, there are many gardening and landscaping programs in Sterlitamak, republican and municipal budgets has allocated the necessary funds to accomplish these objectives, attracting more and more people into landscaping and improvement of the city.
Both Bashkotrostan and Sterlitamak have implemented a federal program for renovating housing and communal services. In the city it operates since 2008, but few buildings has actually been renovated with balconies, new tile roofs, with streamlined elevators, new sewers and repaired doors.
One result of landscaping and improvement programs is the title of "Golden City of Russia" received by Sterlitamak. In 2007 the city was awarded the title of "the most comfortable city in Russia," among cities with populations up to a million people. Just 15 years Sterlitamak from the list of the most polluted cities joined the list of the cleanest and greenest cities in Russia. One reason for the sharp improvement in the environment and livability was a unique strategy for the city administration on key industries — each of the seventeen largest plants were "attached" area of the city, which they must serve. Another reasons were the campaign for cleanliness in the streets, the mentality of the residents, high sense of responsibility of city utility services.
In addition to the honorary title of "Golden City of Russia", in 2009, the municipal service of park management of Sterlitamak took the first place "Crystal Wheel 2009" among the city parks of Russia and CIS countries under the nomination of "Best Amusement Park with the number of visitors from 100 thousand to 250 thousand people per year".

=== Public transport ===


==== Trolleybus ====
The main public transport mode in Sterlitamak is the trolleybus. The trolleybus system has 18 main and 3 supplementary routes, served by 135 trolleybuses each day. It carries more than 230,000 passengers per day, representing about 80% of public transport usage in Sterlitamak. It has become a tradition for Sterlitamak to extend trolleybus routes to serve new construction sites, and this explains the great popularity of the trolleybus in the city.
Most trolleys have been purchased from "Bashkir Trolleybus Plant".


==== Bus ====
Also in the city has a bus service. Major bus routes pass through the main streets of the city and most of them repeat trolleybus routes, but are inferior in frequency to trolleys. Bus transportation is provided by Sterlitamak Passenger Motor Transportation Enterprise (GUP Bashavtotrans). These are comfortable buses, with a lowered stance, a Bashkir brand NEFAZ.


==== Other types of public transport ====
Also, the city has shuttle buses, which exceed the bus and trolley buses in speed and maneuverability (they are substantial due to the increase of traffic jams in the city). On July 25, 2008 in the city it became forbidden to use Gazelle minibuses, a step because the engines of national Gazelles are not equipped with environmental standards Euro-3, so now there are Mercedes Sprinter, Volkswagen Transporter and Peugeot Boxer minibuses in operation. All these foreign brands are equipped with engines of Euro-3 and EURO-4, and have a high level of security. In the spring of 2009 the city administration gave permission for passengers on the "Gazelle", provided that their number does not exceed 40 units.


=== Intercity ===


==== Railway ====
The city has a station on the segment of non-electrified route "Ufa-Orenburg", but is out of demand from the passengers and is used mainly for cargo transportation. The main disadvantage of rail transport in this direction - a very low speed (the road to Ufa will take approximately 5 hours, for buses - 2,5–3 hours). This is because the main part of the road passes through the single track road.
