Shendi or Shandi (شندى) is a town in northern Sudan, situated on the east bank of the Nile River 150 km northeast of Khartoum. Shandi is also about 45 km southwest of the ancient city of Meroe. Located in the River Nile wilayah, Shandi is the center of the Ja'aliin tribe and an important historic trading center. Its principal suburb on the west bank is Al-Matamma. A major traditional trade route across the Bayuda Desert connects Al-Matamma to Marawi and Napata, 250 km to the northwest. The town is the historical capital of the powerful arabised Nubian Ja'alin tribe whom most of its denizens belong to.
