Santutxu is a neighbourhood of the spanish city of Bilbao. It belongs to the 4th urban district, named Begoña. It is a popular residential neighbourhood which has a significant number of small businesses and has received some waves of immigration in the last years, particularly Romanians .The Begoña district consists of three neighbourhoods: Santutxu, Begoña and Bolueta. 
It's a popular myth among locals that Santutxu is the most densely populated neighbourhood in Europe. However, according to the latest research on the subject and the data from the Bilbao City Council, Santutxu has the third most densely populated sq/km in Europe, with about 41.378 residents per sq/km, when considering districts of a certain size. Therefore, Santutxu comes in third place only after L'Hospitalet de Llobregat in Greater Barcelona and La Goutte d’or in Paris, neighbourhoods which have slightly more than 50.000 residents per sq/km.


== History ==
Santutxu (meaning little Saint in Basque), owes its name to a hermitage which was dedicated to Francisco de Paula. This hermitage was founded in 1737 by Francisco Fernando de Barrenechea among others, and was built with the sole purpose of enabling its colonists to hear masses without moving to Begoña church. Since both the hermitage and the Saint figure inside were small sized, it was popularly given the name Santutxu, Santuchu in Spanish. Moreover, the word Santutxu is the result of the union of two basque words, santu which means holy in basque and txu which is a diminutive suffix, also in basque.
In those first years, every second of April was celebrated in honor of San Francisco de Paula with a Major Mass of great solemnity. Representatives of the Hall of the República de Begoña would attend this event, as well as members of the clergy that would take part in every religious event back in those days, where rockets, drumming and of course, a typical homemade Basque wine named txakoli or chacolí in Spanish, were the order of the day.
In 1925, the church of Begoña was annexed (and with it, the neighbourhood of Santutxu) to Bilbao. In the 20th century it went from being a semi-rural zone with great sandlots, to a highly populated neighbourhood, especially after the building and demographic growth of the 1960s.
Luis Briñas Public school is a detached building in Santutxu, located on Iturriaga street, near the Campa de Basarrate. It is monumentally protected and was designed by the architect Pedro Ispizua Susunaga (Bermeo, 1895 - Bilbao, 1976), who also designed the del Tigre, the Mercado de la Ribera, the pergola of Parque Casilda Iturrizar or the Kiosco del Arenal.
In Santutxu, according to the Bilbao Hall census data of 2008, there are 33,346 inhabitants.
