== History ==
The town of Siuna was the site of La Luz Mining company, which was active from 1936 to 1968. There was migration from other areas of the country to work in the gold mine during those years, including people from the coast and indigenous groups. The mine was shut down in 1968 due to damage of the hydroelectric plant.

Currently, Calibre Mining owns the mine, but it is inactive. The only producing mine in the mining triangle is in Bonanza, and operated through HEMCO.
HEMCO is also active in Siuna through the Javier Chamorro Forestry Project working through Norwegian teak grower NORTEAK.


== Government institutions ==
The following government institutions are present and working in Siuna:  MINSA, MARENA, INTA, INAFOR, and as well as the SILAIS office for the RACCN.


== Education ==
There are two universities that offer courses in Siuna.  The URACCAN (Universidad de las Regiones Autónomas de la Costa Caribe Nicaragüense) which offer majors in Agro-Forestry and Local Development. The Martin Luther University offers a Nursing degree.
There is a secondary school run through MINED as well as a secondary/primary school run through the parish.


== Economy ==
The majority of the population today are farmers after the closing of the regional gold mining operations. Service businesses and the educational institutions round out the town's employment.  The primary crops are beans and corn.  There is a greater focus in recent years on cacao production as alternative income.  The organization Cacao RAAN works with a number of cooperatives in the region focused on cacao and chocolate production.


=== Bridges to Community ===
The NGO, Bridges to Community, focused on community development and service learning, has an office in Siuna and actively works in two communities, Rosa Grande and Fonseca.  Bridges to Community works with the local communities in projects focused on education, health, and economic development.  In the area of education, Bridges to Community has most recently built with the community of Rosa Grande a library where now over 400 students in the area go to access literature, research, and study.  In the area of health, Bridges to Community has worked most recently with the community of Fonseca in building a water project to benefit 30 houses in addition to the school and chapel.  Bridges to Community is also working in digging a well and repairing the distribution system at the MINSA hospital to ensure constant water access in the hospital. Currently in discussion is a joint project involving Bridges to Community, MINSA, US-based Medical Schools, and local health leaders in building and creating a model health care clinic in the region.
Bridges to Community's approach is unique in that the NGO only works in communities that solicit the NGO's support and works with the community on projects that the community wants.  In addition the approach focuses not only on construction of projects but of exchange between people and cultures through service learning and reflection.
In 2013 Bridges to Community will begin work in the community of Tadazna.
