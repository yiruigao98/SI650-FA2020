Swords (Irish: Sord [sˠoːɾˠd̪ˠ] or Sord Cholmcille) is the county town of Fingal and a large suburban town on the Northside of Dublin.  Lying ten kilometres north of the city centre, on the Ward River, and reputedly founded around 560 A.D., it features a restored medieval castle, a holy well from which it takes its name, a round tower and a Norman tower.  Near to Dublin Airport, Swords is also home to one of the Dublin region's larger shopping centres, The Pavilions, several other retail facilities and a range of industries.  Suburban housing estates lie around the town centre, with several parks and many schools and sporting facilities.
The name "Swords" is also applicable to a townland, to the civil parish, within the historic County Dublin, and to the local electoral area.


== History ==

The town's origins date back to 560 AD when it was reputedly founded by Saint Colmcille (521–567). Legend has it that the saint blessed a local well, giving the settlement its name, Sord, meaning "clear" or "pure". However, An Sord also means "the water source" and could indicate a large communal drinking well that existed in antiquity. St. Colmcille's Well is located on Well Road off Main Street. Sord may also refer to a "sward", an 'expanse of grass'. The most ubiquitous landscape indicators of early Christian settlement are the ecclesiastical enclosures, and in the case of Swords, the street pattern has been influenced by the circular alignment of the settlement.
The medieval town developed in a linear pattern along Main Street, in a roughly north–south direction. The round tower, 26m in height, is also an indicator of early Christian settlement. The Irish high king Brian Boru is said to have had his funeral at the church on Spittal Hill after he was killed at the Battle of Clontarf; this was of course before the hospital and even the Church of Ireland when there would have been a small chapel there along with the round tower. At the northern end of the street stands Swords Castle, 200m northeast of the ecclesiastical site, which was built in the early 13th century. A short distance north of the Castle is an elevation known as Spittal Hill, where a hospital once stood.In 1994, Swords became the county seat of the new county of Fingal after the abolition of the former County Dublin as an administrative county. In 2001, upon the completion of the County Hall, senior executive offices moved there from Parnell Square in Dublin city centre.
In June 2006, the RNLI Ireland officially opened its new all-Ireland headquarters at Airside Business Park, within greater Swords. It was officially opened by President Mary McAleese. In attendance at this Presidential ceremony was Admiral Sir Jock Slater, RN, a former British First Sea Lord then serving as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the R.N.L.I..


=== Strategic vision ===
Fingal County Council's "Strategic Vision" for Swords is reputedly to create a sustainable "new city". The council has referred to Swords as an "emerging city" and has projected that the population of Swords would rise towards 100,000 by the year 2035. The town is the seventh-largest urban area in the country, and the third-largest in County Dublin, after Dublin City and Tallaght.
Swords Cultural Quarter Masterplan by Fingal County Council proposed to redevelop the center of swords surrounding the castle.


=== Quality of life ===
In 2012, Swords was named the third best town in Ireland to live in. The survey conducted by Retail Excellence Ireland took into account safety, retail, dining, entertainment, events, car parking and overall attractiveness of the town. Since the mid-1990s Swords has seen improvements in shop fronts, public buildings and footpaths and the restoration of Swords Castle.
In 2003 the Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) survey scored Swords the worst "litter blackspot" in the country. Following improvements in litter levels, a 2011 survey declared Swords to be the second cleanest town in Ireland. In the 2019 survey, An Taisce, who carry out the surveys on behalf of IBAL, stated: 'A stellar showing for this large urban area. Swords is a model for others to follow.


== Geography ==


=== Landscape ===

Swords is situated roughly in the centre of the modern county of Fingal and the ancient barony of Nethercross.
The Ward River, coming from County Meath, runs west to east to near the centre of the town, and then turns to run north, before flowing into the Broad Meadow Water or Broadmeadow River to the east of the town, across the former northern road. A small stream joins the Ward near the town centre and the holy well.  The Broadmeadow, also flowing from Meath, borders the north of the town. It runs from Dunshaughlin in the west and across the north of Swords, before receiving the Ward and flowing into the wide Broadmeadow Estuary, then into the Irish Sea past Malahide.  The estuary is crossed by a railway embankment and bridge from Malahide.
Swords is surrounded by a protected green belt. Dublin Airport has prevented the town from expanding further south and the large Broadmeadow Estuary and Malahide beyond limit expansion further east. To the north and west of Swords there is sparsely-populated, relatively flat, farmland.


=== Townlands and baronies ===
The civil parish of Swords mainly lies in the ancient barony of Nethercross. Swords Demesne is the name of the townland in the heart of the urban town of Swords. It is one of 58 such geographic units in the civil parish. However, a single parcel of land, 5 acres in extent, is situated in the barony of Coolock as an exclave of the civil parish proper.
There are 10 townlands in the electoral division of Swords, which is not co-terminous with the civil parish.


=== Urban layout ===

The main retail area is located in the centre of the town, and includes Main Street, with the Pavilions and Swords Central combined shopping centres, and two smaller retail developments, Swords Plaza and Swords Town Mall.  Most civic facilities are also in this central area, with some subsidiary shopping and civic centres in surrounding housing areas.
The west of the urban area is mainly residential, with the neighbourhoods of Applewood, Rathbeale and Brackenstown to the north of the Ward River and Knocksedan, River Valley, Rathingle and Boroimhe to the south side of the river.
The main business and industrial areas are located to the east of the town centre, along the R132 dual carriageway. These include Balheary Industrial Park, Swords Business Campus, Swords Business Park, and the Airside campus (Business Park, Retail Park and Motor Park). The neighbourhoods of Seatown, Holywell and Drynam are also to the east of the town core.


=== Postal designation ===
Swords has a postal address of County Dublin, and an eircode "routing key" of K67.


=== Climate ===
The climate of Swords is, like the rest of Ireland, classified as a maritime temperate climate (Cfb) according to the Köppen climate classification system.  It is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. The hottest months of the year are June, July and August with temperatures of around 17 – 20 degrees. Swords gets rainfall all year round and the wettest months are October to January.


=== Demographics ===

Swords has developed into one of the largest urban areas in Ireland. The town's population boom began in the 1970s with the construction of the sprawling Rivervalley Estate, then Ireland's largest private housing development, ahead of Kilnamanagh Estate in Tallaght North.  It continued during the 1990s and 2000s, with many new residents moving to the area due to its proximity to work at Dublin Airport and various industrial estates.
At the 2011 census, the total urban population of greater Swords was 42,738.  This wider area of Swords had a population density in 2011 of 3765/km2, making it the most densely populated urban area in Ireland.Fingal County Council has referred to Swords as an "Emerging City", and have suggested that the overall area's population may reach 100,000 by 2035.

== Features and historical attractions ==

=== Swords Castle ===

Swords Castle was built as the manorial residence of the 1st Archbishop of Dublin, John Comyn, around 1200 or a little later in Swords, just north of Dublin. It was never strong in the military sense, but covers a large pentagonal walled area of nearly 1.5 acres (6,000 m2) with a tower on the north and a gateway complex on the south. The adjoining chapel, built in the late thirteenth century, was probably used as the Archbishop's private oratory.Other buildings, recorded in an inquisition in 1326, have now vanished, including the great hall on the east side of the enclosure. The Archbishop abandoned Swords once a new palace was built at Tallaght in 1324. The stepped battlements suggest some form of occupancy during the fifteenth century, but by 1583, when briefly occupied by Dutch Protestants, it was described as "the quite spoiled old castle". It was used as a garden in the nineteenth century and sold after the Church of Ireland was disestablished.
Swords Castle has undergone restoration and is open as a tourist attraction. The castle was used as a film location for the production of TV series The Tudors in spring 2010. Swords Castle and Courtyard is open to the public from Monday to Friday by appointment only.
