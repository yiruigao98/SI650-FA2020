Silchar is the headquarters of the Cachar district of the state of Assam, India. It is 343 kilometres (213 mi) south east of Guwahati.
It earned the moniker “Island of Peace” from Indira Gandhi, the then prime minister of India.


== History ==
Under the Kachari rulers, Silchar was a village. During British rule, the city was the headquarters of Cachar (1832). During British rule, ships were docked at the bank of the river Barak. Gradually, a market developed at the bank and became a major place of economic activity. The bank was covered with stones to help dock ships and vessels, and the market was developed at a place that was fully covered with stones. People started to refer to the place as Shiler Chor, meaning "a bank of stones" in Bengali. With the passage of time, Shiler Chor was simplified to Silchar, and the British officials started to use the name Silchar in their official documents referring to the surrounding area of the market. Thus Silchar became the official name of the place. Narsing Akhara (shrine) was built in the mid-19th century. Many other shrines constructed during the British period are also found in Silchar, and a missionary school and polo ground were established in the city in the second half of the 19th century.
