Salekhard (Russian: Салеха́рд; Khanty: Пуӆңават, Pułñawat; Nenets: Саляʼ харад, Salja’ harad) is a town in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia, serving as the okrug's administrative centre. It crosses the Arctic Circle, the main parts being about 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) south and suburbs stretching to the north of the circle.


== History ==
The settlement of Obdorsk (Обдорск) was founded in 1595, in the place of a Khanty settlement called Polnovat-Vozh (Полноват-вож), by Russian settlers after the conquest of Siberia. It was situated on the Ob River, and its name supposedly derives from that. The land around Obdorsk was referred to as Obdorsky krai, or Obdoriya.
The town was often used as a place of exile during the Tsarist and Soviet periods. Among notable people who spent time here were the Doukhobor spiritual leader Pyotr Verigin and Leon Trotsky. The town and nearby area contained three Soviet camps where approximately 6,500 prisoners were held, arrested for their belief in God. At the port of Salekhard, approximately 1,500 prisoners loaded and unloaded goods at the dock, or mined metal ores. About 5,000 prisoners in two camps near Salekhard were assigned to polish diamonds mined from Mir mine.
On December 10, 1930, Obdorsk became the administrative centre of the new Yamal (Nenets) National Okrug. The settlement was renamed Salekhard (from the Nenets "salja' harad", meaning "house on the peninsula") in 1933, and granted town status in 1938.The nearest railway station is at Labytnangi on the opposite side of the river Ob. From 1949 to 1953, the Salekhard-Igarka Railway project made an unsuccessful attempt to extend the line to Igarka, claiming the lives of thousands of Gulag prisoners.  The section of railway from Salekhard to Nadym was completed and remained in use for some time in the Soviet era, although it was later abandoned.  It is currently being rebuilt, along with a long-awaited bridge across the Ob between Labytnangi and Salekhard.
Salekhard was the host city for the 2006 Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in October 2006.In April 2014, Rostelecom, a Russian Internet service provider, completed the final stretch of the Nadym-Salekhard optical internet line. That same line stretches for almost 3,500 km (2175 mi).In summer 2016, after temperatures as high as 95 °F (35 °C) thawed anthrax infected corpses frozen since 1941 near Salekhard, anthrax spores infected reindeer herds and herders.

Salekhard is located in the Ob river valley and is an important river port of the Russian Far North. The unfinished Salekhard–Igarka Railway was set to provide a rail connection between the Ob river port of Salekhard and the Yenisei river port of Igarka. Currently, the nearest railway is at Labytnangi (on the Salekhard–Igarka Railway), 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-west on the opposite side of the river Ob. The project Northern Latitudinal Railway will provide Salekhard access to railway and a long-awaited bridge across the Ob between Labytnangi and Salekhard, and will further connect Salekhard to the Konosha-Vorkuta railway and other parts of European Russia. For 9–10 months of year, the river is frozen and cars and trucks can cross via the river ice. In the summer a ferry operates, however during the floating of ice, generally shortly before the start and shortly after the end of summer, Salekhard is effectively cut off from the outside world, regarding freight. During these periods, only helicopters are able to reach Salekhard in case of emergency. Native people, mainly the Nenets and Khanty people, always build up stocks of food at home, in the shops, and in the markets during this period, but they still suffer from seasonal price increasing. The city is also served by the Salekhard Airport which is located 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) north of the main city.
