== Geography ==
Schofield Barracks is located at 21°29′52″N 158°3′48″W (21.497650, −158.063248).

== Post areas ==


=== Main Post ===
The Main Post area consists of numerous quadrangle-style barracks and unit command structures, most of which have a letter designation.  B and C Quads are the oldest, having been constructed in the 1910s, with D, E, and F quads being built later.  Additionally on Main Post are the PX (post exchange), the Commissary, the "Aloha Building", the Library, Bowling Alley, and Uniform Clothing Store.  Several sets of barracks have recently been constructed (the first set completed in 1998) adhering to a more stylish apartment-type setup.  The Nehelani Club, Old Nehelani Club and Conroy Bowl are in the Main Post area as well.


=== Housing areas ===
Much of the housing on-post has been renovated or rebuilt now that the housing has been privatized.  The enlisted housing area lies to the west of Main Post, while the officers' housing lies to the north along Wilikina Drive. Island Palms is the on-post housing company, which is part of Lend Lease, that is responsible for maintaining the units. The average wait time for housing is 2–6 months and up to one year for larger homes.


=== Area X ===
Area X and its environs constitute the bulk of the training areas on Schofield Barracks.  Large open areas allow for air assault operations to take off and land.  Covered concrete pads can provide shelter for units training in the area who do not wish to deal with sleeping in the field.  The range control office as well as numerous semi-automated and other firing ranges are contained within this area as well.


=== East Range Training Area ===
The Air Assault School, Land Navigation Course, and designated training areas are laid out in this area to the east of the Main Post and the Enlisted Housing area.  Typically, the bulk of the EIB train up and testing are done in this area.


=== Kolekole Pass ===
Kolekole Road, which passes through the Enlisted Housing Area and West Post Training Area, leads up to a saddle named Kolekole Pass which allows vehicle traffic to flow between Schofield Barracks and Lualualei Naval Magazine as well as being an intermediate destination for physical training runs by soldiers stationed on Schofield Barracks.
A 37-foot, 35-ton steel cross located at Kolekole Pass was dismantled by the Army in 1997 after Hawaii Citizens for the Separation of State and Church filed a federal lawsuit charging the cross, built with public tax dollars in 1962, was a "blatant and obvious violation" of the First Amendment.
