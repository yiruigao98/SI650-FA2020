This is a list of villages in Bangladesh. A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Some villages in Bangladesh may be covered in thickets of trees, including bamboo, coconut, date palm, betel nut, mango and jackfruit. Despite this, "only a small portion of the countryâ€™s land surface is covered with forests".
