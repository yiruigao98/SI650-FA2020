Saoula is a suburb of the city of Algiers in northern Algeria. It is one of the five municipalities in the Bir Mourad Ra√Øs District.
Saoula's name most likely comes from two Arabic words: saha, which means "open place", and oula, which means "first". This literally translates to "first open place". Saoula is home to WB Saoula, a football team that plays in the fourth tier of the Algerian Football League system. WB Saoula plays at the Stadium of Saoula, which in 2012 has been renovated to include more seats and artificial turf installed.
The municipality of Saoula serves as a gateway to larger parts of Algiers, most notably Birkhadem.
