== History ==

The municipality of San Miguel de Mayumo was established in 1763 by Carlos Agustin Maniquiz, Maria Juana Puno - wife of Carlos Agustin Maniquiz and Miguel Pineda, with Pineda as the first town mayor of San Miguel. Miguel Pineda was a native of Angat, Bulacan who decided to settle permanently in the barrio of San Bartolome (now named Barangay Tartaro). He found the place ideal for hunting and was later chosen as the leader of other settlers. He formed an alliance with Mariano Puno, the recognized leader of the adjacent prosperous village called Santo Rosario (now named Barangay Mandile).
The town was previously part of Pampanga, hence San Miguel’s culture having Kapampangan influence. In 1848, the town and the neighbouring barrios, which were then part of Pampanga, were added to the territory of the Province of Bulacan.There are two accounts on the origin of the town's name:

According to the 1953 journal History of Bulacan, the town was originally named Mayumo from the Kapampangan term for "sweets". The name San Miguel was added by the Augustinian missionaries who selected Michael the Archangel as the patron saint of the town.
An account tells that the two leaders decided to form a town named Miguel De Mayumo after the name of Miguel Pineda and Mayumo, from the Kapampangan term and for the goodwill and generosity of Mariano Puno.

Aguinaldo made the mountain caves into his headquarters.Biak-na-Bato (21.17 km² in the villages of Kalawakan and Talbak in Doña Remedios Trinidad town and the villages of Biak-na-Bato and Sibul) served as one of the camps of the revolutionary Katipunan forces during the Philippine Revolution.
