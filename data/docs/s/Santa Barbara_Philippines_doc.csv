Although a large part of Santa Barbara is fast getting urbanized, the main economic activity remains farming.  Rice remains its main crop with 6,662 hectares or close to all its total tillable lands devoted to rice farming. The second most important crop is mango of which the town is famous as the home of age-old Philippine mango seedling nurseries, a veritable home industry in town.
Rice and mango are the only crops that are raised in all its 29 barangays. The third most important crop are a variety of vegetables followed by corn. Legumes and root crops are grown in small quantities.
Their livestock include cattle, carabao, hogs, goats and dogs. They likewise raise native chickens for their food and some poultry farms commercially  produce chicken  layers and broilers.
Out of the farm produce, Santa Barbara has developed its own food processing industry that includes the making of rice cakes like latik and suman,  nata-de coco making, and pickles from different fruits.
It likewise has a highly developed clay tiles and pottery industry coupled with non-farm based processing industries like candle and soap making and the making of hollow blocks for construction. The town has one industrial plant, the Ginebra San Miguel  gin manufacturing plant in Tebag West barangay along the national highway towards Dagupan.
The town’s business and trading center in and around the public market features a variety of wholesale and retail and other services establishments from farm inputs to construction materials.  The market serves as the place where its people buy their needs and sell their produce.  Transportation between the commercial center and the many barangays is served by a large fleet of individually owned tricycles.
Santa Barbara’s close proximity to Urdaneta City, has, however, constrained the growth of its trading sector.


== Demographics ==
Santa Barbara is populated mainly by Pangasinans with a sprinkling of other ethnic groups led by the Ilocanos.
It is largely a suburban community with much of its population densely concentrated in 29 barangays. By the year 2016, the town’s population was projected to have reached  86,269, with a growth rate of 3.75 percent per year for the past seven years, faster than the national average.
More than half of the families or roughly 60 percent are farmers who till the northern part of the rich Agno Valley.  Average family income as of the 2000 national census, was a low P9,662.67 a year. Maybe because the average farming family does not buy, but produce the bulk of its own food, family expenditures were lower at P7,545.42.  The average Santa Barbaran family has a disposable income of over P2,000 a year despite statistical data that had shown that a family In the Ilocos region needed PhP 14,749.00 in income a year to survive.
A high level of self-sufficiency in food  is likewise gleaned in the town’s minimal rate of malnutrition of only .50 percent severely malnourished out of 5.12 percent malnourished -pre-school children. The public school system is also proud of having an unusually low drop-out rate in the elementary grades and high school.
Poverty rate in Santa Barbara is high as average income is even lower than the regional poverty threshold. But food self-sufficiency has saved its town folks from sliding to the ranks of the very poor.

== Suburban housing ==
Also owing to its suburban location and easy access to three nearby cities, Urdaneta, San Carlos and Dagupan, Santa Barbara has attracted subdivision developers,  both for middle-class and low-cost markets.
