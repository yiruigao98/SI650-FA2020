Sipoo (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsipoː]; Swedish: Sibbo) is a municipality of Finland. Its seat is in Nikkilä (Nickby). Sipoo is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area.
The coat of arms of the municipality refers to the origin story of the settlement, according to which the ancestors of Sipoo are said to have arrived in the region on a viking ship, the bow of which was decorated with a head of wolf; accordingly, locals have even been called the “wolves of Sipoo”. The wave lined fess of the coat of arms refers to the Sipoo River.

The once almost completely Swedish-speaking municipality is bilingual since 1953, a majority being Finnish speakers, due to migration from other parts of Finland since 2003. Today the Finnish-speaking majority stands at 60% and the  Swedish-speaking minority is about 39% of the population.On June 26, 2006, the Sipoo town council decided on a strategy to triple the municipality's population over the next 25 years. The decision was made after Helsinki announced plans to annex a part of the municipality in order to continue to build high-end urbanizations by the coastline (and thus high-tax revenue producing). The Finnish Council of State voted in favor of the annexation on June 28, 2007, with votes 8 to 4. Sipoo appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, but the court upheld the decision of the Council of State and the annexation took place on January 1, 2009.
As Helsinki did not directly border Sipoo at any point, the city of Vantaa ceded the area lain between Helsinki and Sipoo to Helsinki in the process.
