== Location ==
Located in the south of the island, 54.5 kilometers from the island's capital, the municipality has a triangular shape with a vertex in the interior and a wide base that covers a good part of the southern coast of Gran Canaria.With an area of 333.13 km², it is the largest municipality on the island, covering more than a fifth of the island's surface area.The municipal capital, the rural nucleus of Tunte, is located at 850 meters above sea level, reaching the maximum municipal level at 1,957.3 meters above sea level at the elevation known as Morro de la Agujereada.


== Orography ==
The centre of the coast of the municipality is characterised by its long and wide golden sand beaches, as well as the dune field of Maspalomas and its brackish water pool. The northern end of the coast is, on the contrary, rocky, and the southern end is cliff.
Above the coast there is a wide, fully developed coastal plain, which gradually rises up and, furrowed by deep ravines, heads towards the mountains in the centre of the island.
Evolution of urban land, according to the Cadastre (2010 data): urban land in 2006: 1586 hectares; urban land in 2007: 1612 hectares; urban land in 2008: 1635 hectares; urban land in 2009: 1649 hectares; urban land in 2010: 1657 hectares, representing 5.2% of the total land of the municipality.


== Climate ==
The weather conditions are given by the leeward position of the island and, therefore, to the protection of the humid winds of the northeast. This results in low and concentrated rainfall in the winter months and pleasant temperatures almost all year round.
The average annual temperature is 15,8 °C, with January being the coldest month at 12,1 °C and August the hottest at 20,5 °C. As for rainfall, the average is 307 mm per year.This justifies the fact that the high tourist season extends from September-October to April, the time of year when the mild temperatures make the island a destination for European tourism.

== Economy ==
Tourism is the single crop of the coastal area, while as we go up, we see cooler weather, more fertile land and more agricultural activity.
Rustic land (29,615 hectares), divided into 9,369 cadastral plots: pasture and uncultivated land 85.90%; slow-growing timber species 9.5%; irrigated land 2.3%; fruit trees 1.1%; dry farming 1%. (Source: Cadastre, 2009)
Tourism, the main economic activity in the municipality, is currently in a phase of adaptation. Different studies and organized plans that attend to the current demand and elaborated with the participation of different institutions such as the ULPGC, City Hall, Cabildo and the Government of the Canary Islands, are being put into practice in order to highlight the identity of the municipality and its innumerable values.
They also attend to the modernization of the accommodation plant that, being a pioneer municipality at a tourist level, shows in its urban structure the passage of time, trying to preserve the artistic or heritage value and replacing what has become obsolete.
These plans include new buildings such as a multi-adventure theme park and a high performance sports centre linked to the world of motor sports in Punta de Tarajalillo. Also in Punta de Tarajalillo, the creation of the Wake Park Feliz theme park, dedicated mainly to the offer of water sports.
