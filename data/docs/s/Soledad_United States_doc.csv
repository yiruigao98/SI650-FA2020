Soledad is a city in Monterey County, California, United States. Soledad is located 25 miles (40 km) southeast of Salinas, at an elevation of 190 feet (58 m).  The population was 25,738 at the 2010 census.

The town is located near the Spanish mission, Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad (the mission of Our Lady of Solitude), founded on October 9, 1791, by Fermín Francisco de Lasuén, as the 13th of 21 missions in California.  The town's name comes from the mission.
Soledad is seated at the heart of one of the most economically productive and technologically advanced agricultural regions in the world; hence, the Salinas Valley name, "Salad Bowl of the World." Agricultural companies working out of this region include Dole Fresh Vegetables, Tanimura & Antle Fresh Foods, Taylor Farms, D'Arrigo Brothers Inc., Mann Packing Inc., Merrill Farms and Braga Farms.
Soledad is located in one of the primary wine grape-growing regions of California with over twenty vineyards and wineries within a thirty-mile radius, several of which have tasting rooms and offer a wide selection of wines for sale. Some of the vineyards and wineries located nearby are Chalone, Scheid, Paraiso Vineyards, Pisoni Vineyards, Hahn Estate, San Saba, J. Lohr, Kendall-Jackson, Ventana, Hess Select, Estancia, The Michaud Vineyard and Graff Family Vineyards.


== History ==
The original community of Soledad was established as a Spanish mission on October 9, 1791, by Fermín Lasuén, and founded under the rule of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Virreinato de Nueva España) 1535 to 1821.

The town of Soledad was founded by Catalina Munras, at the wishes of her dying husband Don Esteban Munras. Don Esteban had arrived in the area in 1820 and was granted Rancho San Vicente from Mexico after it gained its independence from Spain. Following her late husband's dream and advice, she selected “poor land, no good for tilling, a town to help all rancheros around.  One lot for a school, one for a church, and one for a cemetario where God would give rest to his workers.” The decision to found the town had some judicious timing, since the Southern Pacific Railroad was stretching down the Salinas Valley by 1872. She granted a right-of-way to Southern Pacific Railroad which was the end of its line in the Salinas Valley for 13 years, providing shipping services for grains and products from the area.
The Township of Soledad was created by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors on February 6, 1876 upgrading the settlement to a town. The Soledad post office opened in 1869. The community of Soledad in 1874 had a few buildings and shops. The two main streets were named Front and Main.
San Vicente School was built in 1913 forming the Soledad School District.  The City, a general law city, incorporated in March 1921 with a City Council/City Manager form of government.  The city's name comes from the mission Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad.


=== Los Coches Adobe ===
The Los Coches Adobe was given to Maria Josefa Soberanes. She married William Richardson and they built the adobe in 1843. It was a working rancho until 1846 when the United States waged war with Mexico to gain control of California. Capt. John C. Fremont and his troops camped there after the Battle of Natividad. Poor guests, they Richardsons, out of house and home and never paid for it. In the mid-1850s, it was a stop on the San Juan Bautista-Soledad stage line and then became a popular inn on the Butterfield Overland Stage route running between San Francisco and Los Angeles. When the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks finally reached Soledad in 1872, the area became a popular stopover for travelers and a place to stay before getting on a Coast Line Stage Company coach for the trip south to Los Angeles.
The demise of the Rancho was caused by the drought that took hold of the valley in the early 1860s. Its severity was devastating to the ranchero lifestyle and it systematically brought that period of history to a close in the Valley. Land was sold at bargain prices to entrepreneurial Americans who changed the landscape from pastoral to agricultural. David Jacks, one of the Valley's early enterprising residents purchased Rancho Los Coches in 1865.
Margaret Jacks, daughter of David Jacks, donated the adobe and 10 acres of land to the State of California and the granddaughter of William B. Richardson, Adeline Richardson O’Brien, donated a marker identifying her ancestral home.


=== Fort Romie ===
In 1898 Fort Romie was founded a few miles north of the mission and west of the city. It was one of three Salvation Army Colonies established in America. The name honors Charles Romie, a landowner who sold the land to the Salvation Army. They included Fort Amity in Colorado, Fort Herrick in Ohio and the Fort Romie Colony on Romie's Ranchita land. The Salvation Army goal was to take poor families from the cities and bring them back to nature so that their lives would be improved. The Salvation Army sought people who had some knowledge of farming. Each family had 10 acres. A family with two children had a two roome house, those with three or more children had a four-room house. Everything was furnished to the settlers without charge: seed, sheds, tools equipment were provided by the Salvation Army for all to use. In return they contracted to make yearly payments of $100 for 10 years, after which they would own the land.


=== Paraiso Springs ===
Located just west of Soledad is the Paraiso Hot Springs. It was used by the Native Americans and the Mission Padres. In the late 1800s and early 1900s it was a popular resort for people taking the railroad from San Francisco to Soledad and then by stage to Paraiso Springs. In 1905, the manager billed the resort as, "Hot soda and sulfur plunge and tub baths with first class masseurs in attendance. Charming climate, grand scenery and flower sin profusion. Stage meets afternoon train at Soledad and carries you over famous Salinas Valley good roads, a distance of only eight miles."Soledad is used as a backdrop in John Steinbeck's 1937 novel Of Mice and Men, a novella about the unusual friendship of two men who find work on a farm in the Salinas Valley. Soledad was chosen as the setting because soledad is Spanish for 'solitude', a recurring motif in the story.
Soledad has been rocked by the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.
The Soledad Prison was three miles (5 km) north of the city until annexed in 1992. It was built in 1946.
In May 1996 the Salinas Valley State Prison was opened at a cost of $236 million.
Soledad's slogan was "It's happening in Soledad" was used until 2013 when "Gateway to the Pinnacles" was introduced.

Although Soledad is known for its agriculture, it was once the home of timber production. Soledad was home to the Sequoia Forest Industries sawmill. It was closed in 1991 and approximately 91 jobs were lost due to the closure of the mill. The warehouse is still in the city as a reminder of past industrial opportunities the small town had to offer.


=== Agriculture ===

Land for agriculture is Soledad's most abundant natural resource.
Soledad's farmland is considered "Prime Farmland", meaning that the soils around and near the city have some of the best physical and chemical characteristics for farming. Due to this fact great efforts in conserving farmland are a very high priority for the city. Prime farmland is the backbone of the Soledad economy. Future planning will consider the effect of urban sprawl amongst the farmlands. Class I, II, and III soils are the most valuable to farming. The climate also allows for year-round crops.
Although Soledad has great soil for salad green crops, it also has a large presence of vineyards and wineries in the valley and foothills. Some famous wineries include Chalone Vineyard, Paraiso Springs Vineyards, Hahn Estate Winery, Zabala Vineyards, Richard Boyer Wines, and Ventana Vineyards. It was once the home of the Paul Masson Winery which is now closed.
Dole Food Company maintains a plant in Soledad. Opened in 1994, it is touted as being the "world's largest pre-cut salad plant."As of 2007, Soledad features a weekly certified Farmers' Market on Soledad St.
