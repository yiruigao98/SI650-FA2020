== History ==

The Municipality of Surallah was created by virtue of Republic Act 3420 on June 18, 1961, as later amended by RA 3664 on June 22, 1963. Its history is generally reckoned with the influx of settlers coming from their abilities under the settlements Programs of NLSA; RPC-NDC; NARRA and LASEDECO.
Surallah started as 6th Class Municipality with 26 barrios and a population of 26,162 settling in a vast land area of 97,000 hectares. The rapid growth of its cluster barrios made the support of the new town.

Subsequently, three (3) Barangays were created from their mother barangay; hence, the municipality has 23 officials barangay.

The separation of Lake Sebu into Municipality made another reduction in the number of barangay from 23 to 17.
The influential leadership of the municipality triggered the tremendous growth development from a small span of years from its creation up to 1990. First, the administration of the Jose T. Sison who served the Municipality from 1963 to 1978 until the election for regional representatives caused Mayor Jose T.  Sison to become the Assemblyman of Region XI. Former barrio treasurer of Libertad, Federico Magalona, Jr. was appointed to assume the office until the Local Election of January 31, 1980. The concluded poll gave the mayoralty seat to Conrado P. Haguisan to serve from seat Lorenzo Delmo until November 21, 1987, who vacated the post to run in the January 18, 1988 election.
