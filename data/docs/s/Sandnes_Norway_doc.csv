== History ==

The small port village of Sandnes was granted ladested (small seaport city) status in 1860. On 6 April 1861, the small city was separated from the municipality of Høyland to form a separate self-governing municipality of its own. Initially, the municipality had 440 residents. On 1 July 1957, a small part of Høyland municipality (population: 18) was transferred to the city of Sandnes.
During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the city of Sandnes (population: 3,961) was merged with the municipality of Høyland (population: 20,353) and parts of the municipalities of Høle (population: 926) and Hetland (population: 2,077).On 1 January 2017, a small 350-decare (86-acre) area on the southwestern edge of the village of Solakrossen was transferred from Sandnes municipality to the neighboring municipality of Sola.On 1 January 2020, the neighboring municipality of Forsand was merged with Sandnes to form one large municipality called Sandnes.


=== Name ===
The city and municipality is named after an old "Sandnæs" farm, since the city was built on its grounds. The first element is sand which means "sand" or "sandy beach" and the last element is nes which means "headland". The farm was located at the end of the Gandsfjorden where the city centre is located today.


=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms was granted on 21 April 1972. The arms show a white piece of pottery on a green background. Pottery was chosen since it was one of the main industries in the late 18th century. The symbol is a leirgauk, which in English would be a ceramic cuckoo-bird (leir(e)= clay/ceramic and gauk/gjøk = cuckoo-bird). The ceramic Sandnes-cuckoo (Norwegian: sandnesgauker) is an ocarina or simple flute which was made by the potteries in Sandnes and used to advertise their products. Later it also became a nickname for people from Sandnes.


== Geography ==
The municipality lies in the Jæren region and stretches 90 kilometres (56 mi) nearly from the west coast of Norway to the rugged mountainous interior. The city of Sandnes is located at the base of the Stavanger Peninsula, about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) south of the city of Stavanger, and these two cities have expanded so as to form a conurbation. The municipality of Sola is located to the west, Klepp and Time, Gjesdal to the south, Sirdal and Bykle to the east, Strand and Hjelmeland to the northeast, and Stavanger to the northwest. The fjord Gandsfjorden is situated north–south at the west end of the municipality and the Høgsfjorden and Lysefjorden dominate the eastern part of the municipality.

From Stavanger and Sandnes it is approximately one hour by car to alpine and skiing resorts. In Sandnes there are some easily accessible small mountain peaks, such as Dalsnuten and Lifjell, with a view over the Sandnes/Stavanger area. The renowned Lysefjorden is also easily accessible by car or boat. The lake Frøylandsvatnet, the river Figgjoelva, and the mountain Hanafjellet are all located in Sandnes.
The Lysefjorden in the eastern part of the municipality is surrounded by very steep 1,000-metre (3,300 ft) tall cliffs such as Kjerag and Preikestolen, with the Lysefjord Bridge crossing the fjord near the western end.  The famous Kjeragbolten boulder and Kjeragfossen waterfall are located along the inner part of the fjord.  The village of Lysebotn lies at the eastern end of the fjord.  The lake Nilsebuvatnet is located high up in the mountains, north of Lysebotn on the border of Strand and Forsand municipalities.

=== 2016 Nord-Jæren municipality debates ===
The Storting decided in 2013/2014 that the number of municipalities in Norway has to be lowered. The process is as of 26 May was still ongoing, with the last ballot to be counted on 30 May.
If the municipalities of Sandnes, Stavanger and Sola merges, the new municipality will be called Nord-Jæren, after the geographic location of the three municipalities. The city council have said no to this merging, but the majority of the parties in the city council will with the people's opinion, in other words, if the result of the elections on 30 May says no, the grand majority of parties will also vote no for the merging to be decided and sent to the Fylkesmann (County Governor), and with that, end the Nord-Jæren debates.
In the case of a no to the merging, an alternative solution is to merge Sandnes with the municipality of Forsand. Gjesdal municipality was a part of what the politicians call the "neighbour's talk", but the conversations between Sandnes and Gjesdal ended as an argument regarding tax on property. Sandnes did not want to introduce this tax, but Gjesdal did.
