Strzelce Opolskie [ˈstʂɛlt͡sɛ ɔˈpɔlskʲɛ] (listen) (German: Groß Strehlitz) is a town in south-western Poland with 17,900 inhabitants (2019), situated in the Opole Voivodeship. It is the capital of Strzelce County. Strzelce Opolskie is one of the biggest centers of German minority in Poland.
The town is located along the major rail line which joins Gliwice and Opole. Until 1999, there was a branch line connecting Strzelce Opolskie with Kędzierzyn Koźle. It closed as part of PKP's cost-cutting measures, although the rails still (2006) remain in site.
During World War II, it held a concentration camp where the Nazis would send prisoners to forced labor. Many died from exhaustion and/or starvation.
