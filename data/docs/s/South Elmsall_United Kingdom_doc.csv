South Elmsall is a small town and civil parish which lies to the east of Hemsworth in the City of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. The town had a population in 2001 of 6,107, increasing to 6,519 at the 2011 Census.


== History ==

The town was largely a small farming settlement until the industrial revolution and the sinking of collieries caused a boom in population and a need for modern housing for the workforce. This has left a town with a mixture of stone and brick buildings. The town and its neighbours were mentioned in the Domesday Book. Other industries such as quarrying for stone, agriculture and brick manufacture were also known at different periods of the town's history, with many of the former buildings and sites associated with them still existing.


== Former quarry site ==

The former South Elmsall quarry was deemed a site of national importance, by Defra, due to the visible section of an unusually complete patch coral reef.


== Coal mining ==
The town is most famous for its coal-mining past; it was the site of Frickley Colliery, which was one of the largest deep coal mines in the United Kingdom.  The colliery invested in several improvements that were of benefit to the area, including the building of the Warde Aldam Hospital, as well as swimming baths and sports facilities.
The colliery became a key source of union radicalism. During the UK Miners' Strike, there were numerous disturbances in the area. It was one of the last pits to return to work after the strike, seeing as it was picketed by a group of hardliners from Kent who continued to picket Frickley after the NUM had called off the strike.  The Frickley miners refused to cross the hardliners' picket.The colliery was closed on 26 November 1993 following closures of nearby pits like Ferrymoor-Riddings (1985), Kinsley (1986), South Kirkby (1988) and Grimethorpe (1992). In 1998 the UK Governments "Social Exclusion Unit" published a series of "Policy Action Team" reports looking at issues of social exclusion. The Skills report used South Elmsall and surrounding towns as a case study and stated "The local communities still suffer from serious
environmental, social and economic problems - and a crisis of morale - as a result of the loss of jobs in the mining industry".


== Warde-Aldam Hospital ==
The Warde-Aldam Hospital was a hospital situated in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, England.  It was built in 1911 by Carlton Main Colliery Ltd and was used as a general, voluntary hospital until 1948.  It was then taken over by the NHS and provided acute hospital care until 1978.


== Music ==
The town is home to Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band, a successful brass band who have been British and European champions.


== Frickley Country Park ==
Frickley Country Park officially opened in September 2009, after a long period of land reclamation, environmental cleaning and landscaping of the former Frickley Colliery site was finished. The site offers walks and play areas as well as space for new housing development as part of the wider regeneration scheme. Nearby is located the Frickley Off-road Centre, a specialist facility for motorsports.


== Local economy ==

The large, traditional market is a central feature of the shopping area of the town, with approximately 105 trading stalls. On the main high street there are shops featuring many household names such as The Post Office, Hallmark Cards, Specsavers, Boots Group and Greggs alongside many other independent shops offering a range of goods and services such as travel, boutique fashion, wedding dress hire, sportswear, a flooring and furniture store and much more.
On the outskirts of the town is the Dale Lane Industrial Estate which is home to a number of large, internationally recognised companies. For example, there are a number of Next Distribution warehouses. The estate itself reflects the change in industry of the area, being one of the key expansion areas since the closure of the local collieries.


== Education ==
Carlton, Moorthorpe, Northfield and Ash Grove are the primary education schools in South Elmsall. The main source of secondary and further education in the town is Minsthorpe Community College, which also provides places to residents of South Kirkby and Upton.

The school and its science and sporting facilities were upgraded as one of the host training facilities for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
