The temple was mentioned in Javanese poem Nagarakretagama canto 37:7 and 38:3 and also in Gajah Mada inscription dated 1351 and discovered in the temple's yard. According to these sources, the temple is the funerary temple of King Kertanagara (ruled 1268 â€” 1292), the last king of the Singhasari dynasty, whose assassinated in 1292 by Jayakatwang of Gelang-gelang and finally led to the establishment of Majapahit rule.

A pair of colossal Dvarapalas giant monolith statue as the guardian of Singhasari royal cemeteries
A well-carved Kala on the west upper face
A large original statue of Shiva as Batara Guru (or, perhaps, Shiva as Agastya) in the lower southern cella.
