According to current Czech legislation, the town is a special status of some municipalities and applies to the entire municipality, including its possible rural areas. In Austria-Hungary and Czechoslovakia until 1939, the status of a city or town (formerly a small town) was in the case of municipalities consisting of more settlements (settlement units) only in the relevant settlement, not in the whole municipality. For example, the village of Valašské Meziříčí consisted of two settlements, namely the town of Valašské Meziříčí and the town of Krásno nad Bečvou. In the Czech Republic, 606 cities and towns are registered in 2018, of which 27 are statutory cities.
