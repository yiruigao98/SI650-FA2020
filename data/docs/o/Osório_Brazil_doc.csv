=== Lloyds ===
In January 2011 he joined Lloyds Banking Group as an executive director, becoming CEO on 1 March 2011.In November 2011, he went on temporary leave due to exhaustion, which the Evening Standard called the most high-profile sick leave in the City. The following month, he announced that he was ready to return to work. In January 2012, he cited the impact that his leave of absence had on the company as the reason that he did not wish to receive a bonus for 2011, and said "As chief executive, I believe my bonus entitlement should reflect the performance of the group".Under his leadership, the bank's financial performance was turned around. It returned to profitability, slimming down to focus on domestic lending and to meet tougher regulatory requirements on the amount of capital it holds. Lloyds started down the road to full private ownership, with the Government reducing its stake in September 2013 and March 2014 respectively. In 2014, Horta-Osório saw his pay increase more than 50 percent to £11.5m as Lloyds returned to profit. Lloyds completed its return to private ownership in May 2017 with c.£900m above the original stake being repaid to the government.In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, Horta-Osório sought to allay fears the bank would shift operations abroad as other UK banks had announced. He told Forbes, "We have no plans to move jobs to Luxembourg, or anywhere else in Europe, as a result of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union…But the nature of our business, and our UK focus, means the direct impact on our business is less compared to our peers".In 2017, Lloyds' statutory profit increased by 24% to £5.3bn in the year and it paid out the largest dividend in its history (£2.3bn) including a share buyback of £1bn. It also completed the acquisition of MBNA (1 June) and announced the acquisition of Zurich's UK workplace pensions and savings business (12 October).In July 2020 Horta-Osório announced that he would stand down as chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group by summer 2021.

He is a keen scuba diver, and enjoys playing tennis and chess.Horta-Osório supported the UK remaining in the European Union.In August 2016, Horta-Osório issued an apology in an email sent to the bank's 75,000 staff for reported transgressions in his personal life while travelling abroad. He clarified that there was no financial misdeed, as he paid all his expenses personally, and indicated that he did not intend to leave the group as a consequence. He wrote: "I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the group’s reputation." His actions were reported to have been in breach of a code of personal responsibility for Lloyds staff that he had introduced himself.


== Mental health ==
Horta-Osório has been public in describing how restoring Lloyds Bank's fortunes "almost shattered" his mental health and he has become a prominent campaigner for employers to support their employees with mental health challenges and so shrug off its stigma.At Lloyds he oversaw the training of thousands of mental health first aiders, while he and around 200 other senior executives underwent a 12-month “optimal leadership resilience programme”, devised with his psychiatrist, Dr Stephen Pereira. Since January 2017, Lloyds Banking Group’s partnership with Mental Health UK has raised £11m and enabled 14,000 volunteering hours and 40 support groups. The partnership also runs a Mental Health and Money Advice service.Horta-Osório was also involved, with Prince William, in the launch of Mind’s Mental Health at Work “gateway” in 2018; and in Lloyds’ membership of the City Mental Health Alliance. He has been widely praised for his campaign against the workplace taboo surrounding mental health issues; Simon Blake OBE, chief executive of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) England, described his openness about his own problems as “inspiring”.In 2020, Lloyds Banking Group’s work to raise awareness of mental health earned it a Gold award in the Business Disability Forum’s Disability Standard.


== Arts ==
In 2015 Horta-Osório was made chairman of the highly regarded Wallace Collection, the most valuable private art collection ever bequeathed to the British nation. In 2019, during his tenure, the gallery eased its traditional “no loans” policy and began both to make and receive temporary loans of selected works – for example, lending Titian’s “Perseus and Andromeda” for the National Gallery’s 2020 exhibition, Titian: Love, Desire, Death. The collection’s director, Xavier Bray, hailed the change as a “revolution” which was “like bringing fresh air to the collection and just making it live again”. Horta-Osório’s chairmanship, a prime ministerial appointment, was renewed in 2019.Horta-Osório is also a significant collector of Portuguese art, particularly works of art made under Portuguese patronage in maritime Asia from the 16th to the 18th century. The collection includes objects created in China, Japan and India (especially Gujarat), often in rare materials such as tortoiseshell, mother-of-pearl and ivory and rock crystal. It also features a number of early chess sets.
