Oguta is a town on the east bank of Oguta Lake in Imo State of southeastern Nigeria.
Oguta is fondly called "Oguta-Ameshi" or "Ameshi"- by its aborigines, indigenes - consists of two parts, the old part which holds the 27 villages of Oguta, and the new part, called the "Oguta New Layout", which is till date arguably the best planned part of  Nigeria. Oguta New Layout, as a rule, in strict compliance with its original master plan. Oguta Town by location is embedded between Oguta Lake on the eastern side, and Obana River that joined Okposha River, on the western side, leaving only the Egwe Gateway as the only dry land route into Oguta without passing through water or a bridge. Oguta is a tourist destination, makes most people including natives to have the preponderance to describe Oguta Town more often - as being located on the east bank of Oguta Lake. Oguta's high-yield oil and gas fields make Oguta an important territory and geographic area when economically vital, oil-producing territories of Imo State or Nigeria which hosting many multinational oil companies like AGIP, Shell, Chevron. Some times Oguta is used as a synonym for Oguta Local Government Area, Oguta LGA, which has Oguta as the salient its headquarters. Oguta LGA is one of the twenty seven local government areas that make up the Imo State. In turn, the Imo State is one of the five states that make up The South-East geopolitical region, which is one of the six geopolitical regions that make up The Federal Republic of Nigeria. With its Oguide Lake and Urashi River bestowing her peculiar advantages, Oguta was one of the chosen endowed territories that the British through the instrumentality of the Royal Niger Company, UAC, and then the British Colonial Government used and exploited diversely. Due to its strategic waterways, oil and gas, palm produce, agricultural products, natural  resources, Oguta was one of the oldest trade and administrative Ccntres in Nigeria. Connected to River Niger, Oguta waterways were used by the British and later Nigerian government forces during the Nigeria - Biafra civil war as routes through which to access and connect to the adjoining towns, villages and other settlement types nearer and further from Oguta, that were and remain principally peopled by other ethnic Igbo people the Mgbidi, Orlu, Awo-Omamma, Nkwerre, Owerri, Okigwe, Umuahia, Aba/Ngwa people, among others, who are substantial parts of the Eastern Nigerian population in the hinterland, collectively called "The Igbos". Given that many people from Oguta are well educated and ascendant since long times, they made and make part of the regional, federal and/or state civil services, hence they live and work in other towns and bigger cities across Nigeria, whereas a good number of Oguta people and their families reside overseas in The USA, Canada, United Kingdom, and other countries of the world. This explains the not quite accurate statistics in some public records like the one purporting that, as of 2012, that Oguta's population was estimated at 20,096. Originally, the people of Oguta (pronounced Ugwuta) belonged to the Ancient Kingdom of Benin before they started to migrate. That was around the 16th Century. The migration became inevitable following the series of wars in which the Benin Kingdom w as engaged for the purpose of extending their Kingdom and wielding greater economic and political power. Furthermore, the iron handed reign of Oba Ewuare the Great and his successor, Oba Esigie, precipitated the migration, which affected many other peoples.
