In Oshiwambo, the language of the Ovambo, the town's name means "that which is in between", although some believe that the name (Oshakati, also Otshakati) was used to refer to the broadcast tower (275 m high), the tallest structure downtown and in Namibia. Oshakati is one of Namibia's largest cities  and it is located near the B1, Namibia's main highway, which stretches from South Africa through the capital Windhoek and on to the Angolan border.
