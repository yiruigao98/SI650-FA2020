Zelenograd (Russian: Зеленогра́д, IPA: [zʲɪlʲɪnɐˈgrat], lit. green city) is a city and administrative okrug of Moscow, Russia. The city of Zelenograd and the territory under its jurisdiction form the Zelenogradsky Administrative Okrug (ZelAO), an exclave located within Moscow Oblast 37 kilometers (23 mi) north-west of central Moscow along the Leningradskoye Shosse highway. Zelenograd is the smallest administrative okrug of Moscow by area, one from bottom by population, and the largest Moscow exclave by area and population within Moscow Oblast. The city of Zelenograd, if it were a separate settlement, would be 5th largest city in Moscow Oblast and one of the 100 largest cities of Russia. Before the expansion of the territory of Moscow in 2012, Zelenograd occupied the second place among the administrative districts of Moscow, second only to the Eastern administrative district in terms of the share of greenery in the total area (~ 30%).
Zelenograd was founded in 1958 as a new town in the Soviet Union, developed as a center of electronics, microelectronics and the  computer industry known as "Soviet/Russian Silicon Valley", and remains an important center of electronics in modern Russia. The city color is green and its emblematic animal is the squirrel (more precisely Sciurus vulgaris).


== History ==
Zelenograd was founded in 1958 as an unnamed planned city near the village and railway station of Kryukovo on a previously empty, forested place, and its architecture and civic layout yields to one general architectural plan (chief architects Igor Rozhin (1956–1963), then Igor Pokrovsky (1963–2002)), which has appreciable influence from the garden city movement, the development of the Tapiola district in Finland, and new towns in the United Kingdom (Harlow and others).
The city was planned as a center of the textile industry initially, but in 1962, Alexander Shokin (Chairman of State Committee of Electronic Technology, then first Minister of Electronic Technology) proposed to change the line of future city business to electronics. Some researchers of Soviet electronics history mentioned that a similar idea was proposed to the Soviet government by two fugitive Silicon Valley engineers - Alfred Sarant (more known in Russia as Philip Staros) and Joel Barr (Joseph Berg).
On January 15, 1963 the city received official city status and name Zelenograd, and on November 25, 1968 Zelenograd received the status of district of Moscow (one of the 30 districts) simultaneously.
In 1988, Zelenograd incorporated the former village of Kryukovo, one of the important sites during the Battle of Moscow (October 1941 – January 1942). Several monuments to the Defenders of Moscow and the heroes of the Great Patriotic War are located in Zelenograd and the surrounding area, the most famous of which is the Shtyki Memorial, from which the remains of the Unknown Soldier were taken for reinterment at the Kremlin Wall in the Alexander Garden in Moscow.
Before 1989, Zelenograd was a de facto closed city in some aspects: it was prohibited to take photos in the central parts of the city, near the plants, teaching and research facilities, and foreigners were not admitted into the city.
In 1991, Zelenograd was reformed in one of the administrative okrugs of Moscow.
