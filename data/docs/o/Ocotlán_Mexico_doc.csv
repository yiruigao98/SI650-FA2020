Ocotlán is a city and municipality in Jalisco, Mexico. Its industry includes furniture production.


== Etymology ==
Ocotlán means "near the pines" or "place of the ocote (pines)". Ocote is from Nahuatl ocōtl, Pinus montezumae, a species of pine.


== History ==
Ocotlán was founded in 1530.  Two main cathedrals line the plaza. One is the church named La Purisima ("The Most Pure"), which is one of the oldest buildings in Jalisco. The altar is dipped in gold. The other cathedral, more recent than La Purisima, was built in the late 1800s and dedicated to Nuestro Señor de Misericordia (Our Merciful Lord), which honors a vision of Christ seen after an extremely destructive earthquake.
The current municipal president is Lic. Absalón García Ochoa, from the National Action Party.


== Appearance of Christ ==
On October 2, 1847 at  approximately 0730, a large and powerful earthquake destroyed most of the city, including the original church. The following day, a Sunday, when the faithful were attending a Mass outside of the destroyed church, a vision of the crucifix was claimed to have been seen. It is said that they saw the vision of Christ, which is why the people of Ocotlán celebrate this day with high regards. It is a recognized event, not to be forgotten. It has become a tradition passed from generation to generation, with celebrations taking place in Ocotlán, and in different parts of the United States by those who have migrated from Ocotlán.
