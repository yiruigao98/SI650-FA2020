== History ==
The area of present-day Owase was part of ancient Shima Province, but was transferred to Kii Province in 1582. During this time, large-scale forestry projects were begun. The town of Owase  was established on April 1, 1889 within Kitamuro District of Mie Prefecture.
The modern city of Owase was established on June 20, 1954 by the merger of the town of Owase with the surrounding villages of Sugari and Kuki and the villages of Kitawauchi and Minamiwauchi (both from Minamimuro District).

== Climate ==
Owase has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with comfortable spring and autumn seasons, and warm winters with practically no snow. The warm Kuroshio Current makes its closest contact with the Japanese coast at Owase, and combined with the high mountains falling almost to the sea, this gives Owase an extremely heavy annual rainfall of 3,850 millimetres (150 in), which is the highest in the world at low altitudes in subtropical and warm temperate latitudes. Only certain parts of southern Chile, coastal British Columbia and the Adriatic Sea coast have as much rain at low elevations outside the tropics.
Despite the excessive wetness of the climate, summers are no more uncomfortable or humid than in the rest of southern Japan: indeed humidity is marginally lower than on cities close to the Seto Inland Sea or on the southern Sea of Japan.
