== History ==
Alfred L. and Benjamin O. Williams were early European-American settlers in the area. They were joined by Elias Comstock, who built the first permanent home in the settlement. Owosso was incorporated as a city in 1859, at which time it had 1000 people. The city's first mayor was Amos Gould, a judge originally from New York. Many other settlers also migrated across the Northern Tier from New York and New England. In 1876, the city organized its fire department.The pattern of settlement and migration resulted in a majority-white city. In the 1950s, Owosso was reported by a major Montgomery, Alabama, newspaper to be a sundown town, where African Americans were not allowed to live or stay overnight. It was reacting to increased civil rights activism and Northern criticism of Southern racial segregation, following the United States Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.
