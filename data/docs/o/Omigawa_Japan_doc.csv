== Early mixed martial arts career ==
Omigawa made his professional mixed martial arts debut in 2005 against future UFC veteran Aaron Riley at PRIDE Bushido 7. Omigawa and Riley traded punches before Omigawa was knocked out by a head kick six minutes into the first round. Omigawa then fought for the British Cage Rage organization against future two-time K-1 HERO'S Middleweight Champion Gesias Calvacante. He again lost this fight by knockout, this time from an overhand right.
After a majority decision loss to Kazunori Yokota brought Omigawa's record to 1-4, he then strung together three consecutive wins in the DEEP organization, before making his UFC debut at UFC 76 against Matt Wiman. He lost this fight via unanimous decision. Omigawa then fought again for the UFC at UFC Fight Night: Swick vs Burkman against Thiago Tavares and lost again via unanimous decision.
After cutting down to the Featherweight division, Omigawa's recognition and career began to take off. Though he lost his division debut against future WEC and UFC veteran Jung Chan-Sung, Omigawa made a resurgence when he entered the Sengoku Featherweight Grand Prix tournament promoted by World Victory Road. As a heavy underdog he defeated the likes of LC Davis via unanimous decision and Nam Phan via TKO. In the semi-final he faced then-undefeated Pancrase Featherweight Champion and future Sengoku Featherweight Champion Marlon Sandro. This fight was originally ruled as a majority draw before Omigawa was awarded the victory by split decision. This brought Omigawa to the final of the tournament against Masanori Kanehara (the semi-finalist loser) who stood in for Hatsu Hioki as Hioki could not continue to compete. Omigawa lost by a close split decision against Kanehara but in return earned him the recognition as a strong Featherweight.
After the tournament Omigawa continued to earn a spot as a world top five Featherweight, defeating the likes of Hatsu Hioki via a controversial split decision, Hiroyuki Takaya via TKO at Dynamite!! 2009, Micah Miller, and Cole Escovedo via armbar.
