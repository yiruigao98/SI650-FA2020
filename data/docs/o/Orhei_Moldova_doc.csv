Orhei (Romanian pronunciation: [orˈhej]; Yiddish Uriv – אוריװ), also formerly known as Orgeev (Russian: Орге́ев), is a city, municipality and the administrative centre  of Orhei District in the Republic of Moldova, with a population of 21,065. Orhei is approximately 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of the capital, Chișinău.


== History ==
Orhei takes its name from the medieval city of Old Orhei, about 10 miles (16 km) below the modern city on the Răut River, which was destroyed by the Crimean Tatars in the 14th to 16th centuries. It was the Ottoman-occupied military center of northern Bessarabia until it was ceded to the Russian Empire in 1812. The word "orhei" was used by local population, meaning "strengthened hill,  fortress, deserted courtyard". The name "Orhei" is, according to one theory, derived from the Hungarian word Őrhely, meaning "lookout post", dating from the 13th century, when Hungarian forces built a series of defences in the area. Regardless of origin, Orhei gets its name from Orheiul Vechi, an active monastery near the village of Ivancea.
Like the rest of Bessarabia, Orhei was taken by the Kingdom of Romania after World War I and was annexed by the USSR in 1940. It was liberated from Axis forces on April 6, 1944, during the Uman–Botoșani Offensive, and was rebuilt after the war. In 1991 it became part of the Republic of Moldova.
Prior to 2003, Orhei was the capital of Orhei County, a large administrative region, but the country was divided further into Raion, or districts.
The St. Dumitru Church built by Vasile Lupu is located in this town.
Ilan Shor was elected mayor in 2015; he served until 2019.  Pavel Verejanu won the 2019 mayoral election in 2019, with about 80% of the vote.  Verejanu was Shor's preferred candidate.


== Demographics ==
While Orhei was still within Bessarabia, the population in 1920 was estimated to be 25,000. At that time, two thirds of the population were Jewish. The remaining population was Russian, Romanian and Ruthenians. Most people speak Romanian and Russian. There is one school that is taught in Russian.

Orhei was the first place in what was then known as Bessarabia, to have a successful tobacco industry. The area is also known for wine production.
