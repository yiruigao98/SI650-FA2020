== History ==
Overland Park traces its roots to 1905, with the arrival of its founder, William B. Strang Jr. who began to plot subdivisions along an old military roadway, which later became the city's principal thoroughfare. Strang developed large portions of what would later become downtown Overland Park.On May 20, 1960 Overland Park was officially incorporated as a "city of first class", with a population of 28,085. As in the case of hundreds of other suburban cities across the United States the following decades were incredibly successful. Less than thirty years later, the population had nearly quadrupled to 111,790 in 1990. While slowing somewhat, this growth rate continues on nearly three decades later, increasing to 173,250 as of the 2010 census. Overland Park officially became the second largest city in the state, following Wichita, Kansas, after passing Kansas City, Kansas in the early 2000s.
Overland Park's success has not come without controversy though. Population growth in the city can mainly be attributed to the traditional greenfield suburban development. This pattern can be noted by viewing the city's annexation map. Overland Park's last annexation attempt in 2008, garnered widespread news coverage after massive outcry from affected residents. In total over 8 square miles (21 km2), though half of the 15 square miles (39 km2) the city originally requested, was added to the city. Overland Park now has a combined land area of 75.37 square miles (195.21 km2) and spans nearly the full North-South length of Johnson County. Though the outcry Overland Park caused lead state legislators to amend state laws governing annexations to require a majority vote of affected residents in all future annexations over 40 acres (0.16 km2).On April 13, 2014, a pair of shootings committed by a lone gunman occurred at the local Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and Village Shalom, a local Jewish retirement community. A total of three people were killed in both shootings. The suspected gunman, described as a man in his seventies, later identified as Neo-Nazi Frazier Glenn Miller, Jr., was taken into custody.Overland Park was awarded "Best city to raise a family" and "One of the most popular cities for millennials" in 2018.
