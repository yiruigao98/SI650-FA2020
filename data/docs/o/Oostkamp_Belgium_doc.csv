=== Kastelen: Castles, Châteaux and Mansions ===

Oostkamp has about twenty outstanding examples of Kasteel (plural kastelen), meaning castles, châteaux and mansions. These were erected as 'countryside retreats' of 'leisure houses' by the nobles and merchants of the area, many of them with permanent abodes in nearby Bruges. Most kastelen are private property and therefore not to be visited. Many are visible from the public road.
