Køge (Danish pronunciation: [ˈkʰøː(j)ə], older spelling Kjøge) is a seaport on the coast of Køge Bugt (Bay of Køge) 39 km southwest of Copenhagen. It is the principal town and seat of Køge Municipality, Region Sjælland, Denmark. In 2020, the urban area had a population of 37,754.The natural harbour and strategic location have given Køge a long history as a market town. Today, that past is evident in a well-preserved old town centre with many half-timbered houses.
Køge is located in the Copenhagen metropolitan area and is connected to downtown Copenhagen by the E line of the S-train commuter rail system. Køge is also on the Copenhagen-Ringsted Line that was opened in June 2019. The new line positioned Køge as a central hub in Denmark's transport system.


== History ==
Like most Danish cities, the origins of Køge precede written history. Køge was first recognized as an official market town in 1288, as a contrast to the ecclesiastical center at that time – Roskilde, and was an important merchant town during the late Middle Ages.
During the local witchhunt, called Køge Huskors (1608–1615), at least 15 people were convicted of witchcraft and burned at the stake.
Køge suffered during the wars between Denmark and Sweden (1643–1720, → Battle of Køge Bay). In 1807, the town and surrounding area was the scene of the Battle of Køge between British and Danish troops. Køge remained a small town until the late 19th century, when industrial development and population growth began. Today, Køge form the core of the 18th largest urban area in Denmark.


== Geography ==
Køge is located at the back of Bay of Køge, demarcated by Copenhagen to the north and the Stevns Peninsula to the south, where Køge Å (Køge Creek) meets the sea.

Originally a section of a row of hovels, it is now a part of the public library. Pictures can be found in the gallery.

The tower of the church contains a lighthouse, the first to be built in Denmark.
