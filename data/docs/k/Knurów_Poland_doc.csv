Knurów is located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Bierawka River, a tributary of the Oder River.


== History ==
Knurów's history as major town is relatively short, as it only became a town in 1951, as result of the merger of the settlements of Krywałd and Szczygłowice. However, Knurów's existence can be traced back as far back as 1295. The original name was Knauersdorf or Cnurowicz, as it emerged as a German settlement during the German resettlement of former Germanic areas during the Middle Ages. As with the rest of Upper Silesia, the town changed hands between the kingdoms of Prussia and Poland over the course of its history. The town rapidly grew at the end of the 18th Century as the Industrial Revolution came and vast coal reserves were found in the area. The coal industry continued growing well in the 20th Century, and doubled its output with a new mine being built in 1961 in Szczygłowice. More recently, in May 2015, riots ensued in the town after a Concordia Knurów fan was shot dead by police during a football match.


== Population ==
Knurów is one of the cities of the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Silesian metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the town is 38,310 (2019).


== Politics ==
Administratively Knurów has been part of the Silesian Voivodeship since the latter's formation in 1999; previously it was part of Katowice Voivodeship.


== Economy ==
