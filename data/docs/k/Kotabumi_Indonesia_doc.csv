Regencies (kabupaten) and cities (kota) are the second-level administrative subdivision in Indonesia, immediately below the provinces, and above the districts. Regencies are roughly equivalent to American counties, although most cities in the United States are below the counties. Following the implementation of decentralization beginning on 1 January 2001, regencies and city municipalities became the key administrative units responsible for providing most governmental services. Each of regencies and cities has their own local government and legislative body.
The difference between a regency and a city lies in demography, size, and economy. Generally, a regency comprises a rural area larger than a city, but also often includes various towns. A city usually has non-agricultural economic activities. A regency is headed by a regent (bupati), while a city is headed by a mayor (walikota). All regents, mayors, and members of legislatures are directly elected via elections to serve for a five-year term which can be renewed once. Each regency or city is divided further into districts more commonly known as kecamatan.
An administrative city (kota administrasi) or an administrative regency (kabupaten administrasi) is a subdivision of province without its own local legislatures (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah). The leader of administrative city or administrative regency is directly appointed by the governor. This type of city and regency in Indonesia is only found in Jakarta which consisted of five administrative cities and one administrative regency.
As of September 2019, there were 514 second-level administrative divisions (both kabupaten and kota) in Indonesia. The list below groups regencies and cities in Indonesia by provinces. Each regency has an administrative centre, the regency seat.

== Proposed new regencies ==
On 25 October 2013 the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of 57 prospective regencies/cities (and 8 new provinces), as set out below:
"With these new regions, it is hoped that we can shorten the line of governance, improve land and security aspects, and no less important, support historical and cultural [institutions]," House Speaker Marzuki Alie said.
The agreement will be forwarded on for government approval. Marzuki said that the new regions, especially in areas bordering other nations, will be able to support more development so that border areas develop faster and become less vulnerable to the territorial claims of other countries.
Under the new package, eight new provinces will join Indonesia's current 34; three of the new provinces are in Papua and West Papua. The new provinces are Sumbawa, South Papua, Central Papua, Southwest Papua, Tapanuli, Nias Island, Kapuas Raya, Bolaang Mongondow Raya, Kotawaringin, Tanjungpura, and North Lampung.The seventeen newly created regencies in Papua Province will comprise the regencies of Gili Menawa, Moyo, Balin Senter, Bogogha, Puncak Trikora, Muara Digul, Admi Korbay, Katengban, Okika, Northwest Yapen, East Yapen, Numfor Island, Yalimek, Mambera Hulu, Southwest Yahukimo, East Yahukimo and Gondumisisare; in addition there will be two new  municipalities of Merauke and Lembah Baliem (Baliem Valley).
