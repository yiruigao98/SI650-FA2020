== History ==
Known in Roman times as Clypia or Clupea, (Ancient Greek: Κλυπέα)  the town was founded by the Carthaginians as the fortified town of Aspis (Ancient Greek: Ἀσπίς) in the 5th century BC. The Siege of Aspis in 255 BC was the first African battle of the First Punic War.

Clupea was also the seat of an ancient Christian bishopric.
At the Council of Carthage (411), which brought together Catholic and Donatist bishops, Clypia was represented by Bishop Leodicius and the Donatist Geminius. Aurilius was one of the bishops whom the Arian Vandal king Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484 and then exiled. Two other bishops of Clypia took part in the Council of Carthage (525) (Bishop Crescentius) and Council of Carthage (645) (Bishop Stephanus).No longer a residential bishopric, Clypia is now listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.
