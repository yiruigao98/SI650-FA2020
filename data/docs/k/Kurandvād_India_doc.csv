Would it be fair to say that Aamir Khan, a well-known actor in Hindi cinema, had rested in the Ghats cemetery in Kurundwad? But due to exhaustion, the people of Kurundwad remember that he had rested there for an hour and a half. Aamir Khan's film 'The Rising Sun - Mangal Pandey' was released in 2005 and was directed by Ketan Mehta. Along with Aamir Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Amisha Patel and Ompuri have major roles in it. This is the story of that time.
For some of the events in the life of Mangal Pandey that took place in the Meerut region of Uttar Pradesh, a riverside ghat was needed. Aamir Khan and his team were walking around looking at such ghats. The team had a young man from Kolhapur. He had seen Krishna Ghat of Kurundwad as a child. He informed Aamir Khan about this loss. After seeing Godaghat of Nashik, the team reached Kurundwad. Aamir Khan came to Krishna Ghat of Kurundwad. They looked around the ghat. He and his team loved the ghat. He is the author of 'Mangal Pandey'.
But Aamir Khan was tired from the previous journey. He went to a nearby cemetery with a colleague without telling anyone. I fell on the bed in the hut and fell asleep in an instant! The leading hero of the film industry has come to our village. The people of Kurundwad did not notice that he had slept for one and a half to two hours on the bed in the cemetery of Chakka village. However, Aamir Khan's film 'Mangal Mangal Ho' and Kurundwad's Krishna Ghat reached all over the country and abroad.
Kurundwad is an hour's journey south of Sangli near Nrusinhwadi. Krishnaghat lies between Nrusinhwadi and Kurundwad.
