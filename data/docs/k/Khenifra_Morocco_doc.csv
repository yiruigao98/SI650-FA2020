== History ==
Khenifra has been the Zayanes' central town for centuries. As such, it was an important military holding in the Zaian War. French General Paul Prosper Henrys had planned to lead the first attack on Khenifra on 10 June 1914. There would be three columns of troops, totaling up to 14,000 officers, to take Khenifra from the Zayanes control. One column was under Lieutenant-Colonel Henri Claudel, one under Colonel Gaston Cros, and one under Colonel Noël Garnier-Duplessix. Mouha ou Hammou Zayani led troops to attempt to stop the Khenifra campaign, but was eventually unsuccessful. The French took control of the town, but with losing around 600 men. In addition to leading the Zayanes, Hammou was responsible for much of the early 20th century development of Khenifra, having overseen the development of accommodations and mosques in the town.
