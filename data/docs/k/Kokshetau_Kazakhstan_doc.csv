The name Kokshetau is of Kazakh origin literally meaning "a smoky-blue mountain", kokshe / "көкше" (meaning 'blue') and tau / "тау" (meaning 'mountain'). Until October 7, 1993 it was officially known as 'Kokchetav' (Russian: Кокчета́в, IPA: [koktɕɪˈtav]). 
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and independence of Kazakhstan, the city was renamed to the more Kazakh-sounding Kokshetau as part of the government's campaign to apply Kazakh names to cities.
