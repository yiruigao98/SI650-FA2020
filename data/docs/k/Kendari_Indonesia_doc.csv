== History ==
In 1831, a Dutch cartographer named Vosmaer was tasked with mapping the area of Kendari. While performing this task, he is said to have met with the indigenous tribe, the Tolakis, and to have built their king a palace in the harbor of Kendari. The palace was completed on 9 May 1832, and now 9 May is celebrated as the date of Kendari's founding.Over time, the city became an important center of Sulawesi in the Dutch East Indies, first becoming the capital of the Kewedanan District and later the Laiwoi Onder Afdeling District.


=== World War II ===

Kendari was an important objective of the Japanese in World War II because of the nearby airfield, (now Haluoleo Airport) which could be used to interdict the sea lanes between Australia and the Dutch East Indies and to bomb Dutch bases on Java and other Islands. The garrison of Kendari was surprised by a Japanese landing on the night of 23–24 January 1942 and put up little resistance before Kendari and the intact airfield were captured.During the Japanese occupation the airbase was used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. In the second of the two raids on Darwin in Australia on February 19th 1942, 27 Mitsubishi G4M "Betty" medium bombers joined 27 Mitsubishi G3M "Nell" bombers flying from Ambon.
