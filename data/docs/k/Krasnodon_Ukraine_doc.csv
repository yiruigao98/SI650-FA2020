By the Decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, on 28 October 1938 it was renamed to Krasnodon.A local newspaper is published in the city since September 1930.During the German-Soviet War, Krasnodon was occupied by Nazi Germany from July 20, 1942 to February 14, 1943. The Soviet Komsomol organization resistance Young Guard operated in the city from October 1942 to January 1943, when most of its members were arrested and executed.
