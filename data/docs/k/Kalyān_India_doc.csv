== History ==
In pre-independent India, the British Raj spelled Kalyan as Kallian, Cullian, Callian and sometimes as Callianee. Over the centuries, the city has seen attacks by various foreign armies, including the Mughal, the Portuguese and the British. The Marathas were held in high regard by the locals for being their only line of defense against invasions.Walter Hamilton, a foreign visitor passing through India, described Callianee as 'A Geographical, Statistical, and Historical Description of Hindustan, and the Adjacent Counties' in Volume 2 on page 150 of his 1820 book.

=== Durgadi Fort ===

The city of Kalyan was surrounded by a fort wall, the construction of which began during Shah Jahan's reign and was completed during Aurangzeb's reign in 1694 A.D. This city wall, which ran in excess of 2000 yards, 2123 to be precise, was guarded by 4 gates and 11 towers. The fort wall enclosed an area of 70 acres and on a high mound near the Kalyan creek, where the current Ganesh ghat stands, was a fine fort since as early as 1570.
The wall of the fort along the top of the inner bank of the ditch, and, near the north end, had a gateway known as the Delhi or Killyacha Darwaja.Under the Marathas (1760–72), a new gate about 150 feet (46 m) to the south of the Ganesh gate was opened near the mansion of Ramji Mahadeo Biwalkar, the Peshwa's Governor. In the citadel of the fort Marathas built a small wooden temple of Durgadevi behind the mosque, and called the fort Durgadi Killain in honor of the goddess, a name which it still bears. The fort measures 220 feet (67 m) in length and somewhat less in breadth. Under the English rule, the fort wall was dismantled and stones carried to build the Kalyan and Thane piers and a dwelling for the customs inspector in the west of the Kalyan fort. The gate to the north-west is almost the only trace of the fort wall, which is of rough stone masonry. During 1876 the original idol of the goddess Durga was stolen.
