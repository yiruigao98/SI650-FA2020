Korosten (Ukrainian: Ко́ростень, historically also Iskorosten Іскоростень) is a historic city and a large transport hub in the Zhytomyr Oblast (province) of northern Ukraine. It is located on the Uzh River. Korosten serves as the administrative center of the Korosten Raion (district), though administratively it is not part of the raion and is incorporated as a city of regional significance.


== Name ==
There are different theories about the origin of the name of the city.
The name may be derived from the word korost, 'brushwood, bushes, shrubbery'; the form Iskorosten sometimes found in early sources is probably based on the common repetition of prepositions in Old East Slavic: iz grada iz... 'from the city from...'.Another theory holds that the city was built entirely of wood, and its walls were surrounded by an oak fence, unhewn, with bark, leading to the name Is-koro-sten, i.e. the city "from bark on the wall" in Ukrainian.Alternatively, the city might have been named after the sun god Khors/Xors (Horus) - the main god of many tribes that inhabited the area, including the Drevlians. According to this theory, the names of the settlements of Korsun and Korostyshiv also come from Khors/Xors.


== History ==


=== Early History ===

The city was founded over a millennium ago and was the capital of the Drevlyans, an ancient Slavic tribe (later incorporated into Kyivan Rus′).


=== The Rus ===

In 945, Prince Igor of Kyiv ruler of the Kyivan Rus was killed in while collecting tribute from the Drevlians in Iskorosten. According to 10th century Byzantine historian and chronicler, Leo the Deacon: "They [Drevlians] had bent down two birch trees to the prince's feet and tied them to his legs; then they let the trees straighten again, thus tearing the prince's body apart." The Primary Chronicle blames Igor’s death on his own excessive greed, indicating that he tried to collect tribute for a second time in a month. 
Igor's widow, Olga of Kyiv, as regent on behalf of their son Svyatoslav. avenged his death by punishing the Drevlians. Olga then led her army to Iskorosten. The siege lasted for a year without success, when Olga thought of a plan to trick the Drevlians. She sent them a message: “Why do you persist in holding out? All your cities have surrendered to me and submitted to tribute, so that the inhabitants now cultivate their fields and their lands in peace. But you had rather tide of hunger, without submitting to tribute.” The Drevlians responded that they would submit to tribute, but that they were afraid she was still intent on avenging her husband. Olga answered that the murder of the messengers sent to Kyiv, as well as the events of the feast night, had been enough for her. She then asked them for a small request: “Give me three pigeons...and three sparrows from each house.” The Drevlians rejoiced at the prospect of the siege ending for so small a price, and did as she asked.
Olga then instructed her army to attach a piece of sulphur bound with small pieces of cloth to each bird. At nightfall, Olga told her soldiers to set the pieces aflame and release the birds. They returned to their nests within the city, which subsequently set the city ablaze. As the Primary Chronicle tells it: “There was not a house that was not consumed, and it was impossible to extinguish the flames, because all the houses caught fire at once.” As the people fled the burning city, Olga ordered her soldiers to catch them, killing some of them and giving the others as slaves to her followers. She left the remnant to pay tribute. As a result of this Olga changed the system of tribute gathering (poliudie) in what may be regarded as the first legal reform recorded in Eastern Europe.
In 968 the nomadic Pechenegs attacked outlying regions of the Rus and then besieged the city.


=== The Middle Ages ===
After the partition of Rus in 1097, Iskorosten remained under the jurisdiction of the Kyivan princes. In December 1240 the Mongol invasion of Rus', led by Batu Khan sacked and burned many cities and settlements in the region of Iskorosten. From 1243 the Mongol-Tatars, in the form of the Golden Horde (the western section of the Mongol empire) ruled. After victories over the Tatars at the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362 (or 1363) the Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas annexed these lands to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Later he presented them to one of his knights Terekha from Bryansk for faithful service. From 1385, after the formation of the Union of Krewo, this territory came under the influence of Poland.


=== Early Modern Period ===

In 1586, a powerful Polish magnate, Prokop Mrzewicki, married one of Terekh's heiresses and became the owner of Iskorosten. He managed to persuade the Polish king to grant this small walled settlement the status of a city. On 22 May 1589 King Sigismund III granted the city of Iskorosten its first charter.
In 1649, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising a detachment of Cossacks led by Geraski laid siege to the city. After a bloody battle, the Cossacks captured Iskorosten from the Polish defenders, the cities fortifications were completely destroyed during the assault. In 1654, Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, as a result of the Pereyaslav Rada, signed an agreement with Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich on the transition of Ukraine to Russian jurisdiction. However, from 1667 to 1795 the lands surrounding Iskorosten continued to be part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1768, during the Zaporozhian Cossack and Uman Cossack uprising (led by Maksym Zalizniak and Ivan Gonta respectfully) Ukrainian cossack leader or haidamak Ivan Bondarenko of Kriukivshchyna intended to storm Korosten and incorporate it into his territory, however, the uprising was crushed and his intentions were never realized.


=== Russian Imperial Period ===
After the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Iskorosten passed into the Russian Empire as the center of the Iskorosten parish of the Ovruch district of the Volyn province. For a long time it was a quiet inconspicuous provincial town. The construction of the 417-km Kyiv-Kovel railway in 1902 allowed the town to grow, becoming a major railway junction. In 1909 a porcelain factory opened, further industrialising the town. In 1917 the town was renamed Korosten.


=== Civil War ===
On 10 June 1917, the Ukrainian Central Council declared its autonomy as part of the Russian Republic by its First Universal at the All-Ukrainian Military Congress. After the proclamation of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR), its government and parliament were forced to leave Kyiv during its occupation by Bolshevik troops.In November 1917, Soviet authority was established in the city, but later Korosten was occupied by the advancing Austro-German troops The German army would remained in Ukraine until November 1918.

Between 14 and 27 February 1918, units of the UPR Army were stationed in Korosten at various times.The Red Army took it in February 1918, followed by the Army of the German Empire in March; Ukrainian forces retook the city in December. During February 1919 the Red Army regained control; in August it was taken first by Symon Petlura's men and then by Denikin's army. The Soviets regained control in December 1919. On the eve of Kyiv Offensive Korosten lay on the frontlines between the Polish and Soviet Forces. On 27 February 1921 The Haydamatsky Kish of the Ukrainian People's Republic led by Symon Petliura, a separate Zaporizhzhya detachment led by Konstantin Prisovsky, and a unit of Sich Riflemen led by Yevhen Konovalets passed though Korosten, heading for Kyiv, in an attempt to recapture it from Bolshevik troops.On 7 November 1921, during the November raid, Korosten, occupied by units of the 395th Rifle Regiment of the 132nd Brigade of the 44th Rifle Division of the Moscow Troops, attempted to capture the Volyn Group commander Yuriy Tyutyunnyk of the UPR Insurgent Army. The beginning of the counteroffensive was successful. Ukrainian troops, unexpectedly attacking Korosten, captured the railway station. However, the inconsistency in the actions of different units and the large numerical advantage of the Soviet units did not allow UPR to capitalise on this advantage, and the Ukrainian troops were forced to retreat from the city. Captain Volodymyr Stefanyshyn was killed during the withdrawal, however Ivan Rembolovych, Semen Khmara-Kharchenko and Mykola Tobilevych were decorated for their actions.

Korosten was occupied by the German Army from 7 August 1941 to 28 December 1943 (it was briefly captured by 60th Army forces during the Kyiv offensive on 17 November 1943, but retreated after a strong German counterattack).
