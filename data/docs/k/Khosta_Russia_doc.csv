== History ==

In the Middle Ages, Genoa supported a colony (Costa) at the location of modern Khosta. Eventually the area was taken by the Ottoman Empire, and the settlement was known as Khamysh. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 it was occupied by the Russian Empire, and the whole population was eventually resettled to Turkey. In 1891—1892 the coastal road between Novorossiysk and Batumi was constructed, and first settlers appeared in Khosta. On May 15, 1899, Khosta was granted town status. At the time, it belonged to Black Sea Governorate with the center in Novorossiysk. By 1914, Khosta had a population of 1,500 inhabitants, a brick factory, and a wine production plant.Soviet Power was declared in Khosta in February 1918, followed by the advance of the army of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which in July 1918 occupied the whole coast up to Tuapse. In February 1919, they were driven back by the Volunteer Army under command of Anton Denikin. Between January and May 1920, the Red Army recaptured the area.In 1933, it was decided to totally reconstruct the coastal area and to create a large number of spa resorts. To this end, in October 1934 Khosta was subordinated to the city of Sochi. In the 1950s and the 1960s there was large-scale construction in Khosta.

Khosta Fortress, or rather the ruins thereof, perched on the top of a 100-meter high cliff within six kilometers (3.7 miles) from the sea coast.
The fortress stands on the grounds of an ancient grove of yews and boxwood, which may be up to 30 mya old. The largest yews attain a height of 50 meters; one is estimated to be 2,000 years old. The grove covers an area of 301 ha and has been affiliated with the Caucasus Zapovednik since 1931 and is the World Heritage Site as a part of the Zapovednik.
The Akhun massif comprises Greater Akhun Mtn. (663 m), Lesser Akhun Mtn. (501 m), and Eagle Bluff (380 m). Greater Akhun is crowned by a Neo-Romanesque limestone tower (1936) that offers glimpses of Pitsunda and Gagra across the border in Abkhazia. There is also a chain of twenty karst caves in the massif.
