== History ==

Kashipur was known as Govishana, during the time of Harsha (606–647 AD). The ruins of the large settlement of those days can be still seen near the city. The famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang also travelled the city in the 7th century. He described it as "The Capital was 15 li in circuit. Its position was lofty, and of difficult access, and it was surrounded by groves, tanks and fishponds". Kashipur is believed to have a good historic trade of clothes and metal vessels.
The modern town of Kashipur was founded by Kashinath Adhikari, the governor of Tarai under King Devi Chand of Champawat. Later Raja Mohan Chand ; one the Kings of Kumaon's younger brother Lal Singh was given the estate Kashipur and Raja Guman Singh became its first King. Kashipur's last king Raja Hari Chand Raj Singh again got back the titular throne of Kumaon in British India as Raja Anand Singh (Raja of Almora) had no issues. The exact date of the foundation of the town is disputed, several historians having expressed their own views on the matter. Bishop Heber, in his book Travels in India wrote that Kashipur was founded by a deity named Kashi 5000 years back (approx 3176 BC). Sir Alexander Cunningham invalidated his views in his book, The Ancient Geography of India, in which he wrote "the good bishop was grossly deceived by his informant, as it is well known that the town is a modern one, it having been built about AD 1718 by kashi-nath, a follower of Raja Devi-Chandra of Champawat in Kumaon". Badri Datt Pandey in his book Kumaun Ka Itihaas, contradicting Cunningham's views, claimed the town to be founded in 1639. Kashipur remained under the rule of Chand Kings until the latter half of eighteenth century until Nand Ram the governor of Kashipur became practically Independent and established his kingdom at Kashipur.
When the British arrived in Kumaun at the end of the 18th century AD, Kashipur was ruled by King Shib Lal, the second King of Kashipur. Kashipur was ceded to the British by Shib Lal in 1801 after which it became a revenue division. Bishop Heber visited here during his travel to Almora in November 1824. Heber described Kashipur as a "famous place of Hindu Pilgrimage". On 10 July 1837, Kashipur was included in the Moradabad district. The revenue divisions of muradabad district were rearranged in 1944 following which Bajpur, Kashipur and Jaspur were rearranged into one pargana named as Kashipur. Bajpur was brought under Tarai district in 1859 followed by Kashipur in October 1870. Kashipur was later made the headquarters of Tarai district in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces.


== Geography ==

At 29.22°N 78.95°E﻿ / 29.22; 78.95, and 180 kilometres (110 mi) northwest of New Delhi, Kashipur is located in the south-west of the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand in the Terai – an area of relatively low-lying land, ranging between 500 and 1,000 feet (150 and 300 metres) above sea level and crossed by Kumaon's main north-south watershed between the basins of the Rivers Ramganga and Kosi. To the north of the city lies the Bhabar tract of Ramnagar, which separates the area from Shivalik Hills. Kashipur is drained only by minor rivers and lakes, primarily by Dhela river, a tributary of River Ramganga. Several rivers and stream cross the region transversely and leave their deposit making the land fertile. However, these also dissect the region which renders it unfit for agriculture. Kosi is the master stream flowing in the western part with its broad course from north to south.


=== Location ===


=== Geology ===
Geologically, Kashipur is dominated by the Terai tract, which runs horizontally through the city from Jaspur in the west, passing through the city center, to Bajpur and Rudrapur in the east. Terai formation consists of clays, sandy clays,
fine to medium sand and occasional gravels. In this formation there is a dominance of clayey successions over sandy horizons. There are damp and marshy tracts in places. It is the zone of seepage where fine sand, silt and clay are deposited by the emerging streams. Almost level and fertile soil along with high water table has rendered the belt useful. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone 4, in a scale of 2 to 5 (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes).


=== Climate ===

Kashipur has a humid subtropical climate, like much of the Indo-Gangetic Plains to its south, with average maximum temperatures in summer (June) being around 31.6 °C (88.9 °F); and in winter (January) around 14.5 °C (58.1 °F). The driest month is November, with 5 mm of rain. With an average of 374 mm, the most precipitation falls in July. There is a difference of 369 mm of precipitation between the driest and wettest months. During the year, the average temperatures vary by 17.1 °C. The main seasons are summer from March to June, the monsoon season from July to November and winter from December to February.The climate of Kashipur is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. In summer, Kashipur is largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over low-latitude ocean waters. Temperatures are high and can lead to warm, oppressive nights. Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; tropical cyclones also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions. The coldest month is usually quite mild, although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front. The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is "cwa".
But in the recent years kashipur has witnessed a drastic change in weather and its climatic conditions due to increase in construction in the nearby regions also due to overpopulation and increase in demand by people for the region's resources. due to this we have seen that the trees are cut due to which average temperation is increasing. also the most popular lake in the girital region has alao dried up.
