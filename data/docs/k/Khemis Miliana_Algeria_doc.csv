Khemis Miliana (Arabic: خميس مليانة‎) is a town in northern Algeria of around 84,574 inhabitants.  It is a university town located 120 kilometers west of Algiers.  It was known as Malliana in Roman times, then Affreville during the French colonial era. It should not be confused with the larger city of Miliana nearby.
The Diocese of Malliana is a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church of which Khemis Miliana was the episcopal seat.


== Geography ==

Khemis-Miliana has an important geostrategic location.  It is crossed by the RN 4 and the East–West Highway.  A new highway will link the town of Khemis-Miliana and Berrouaghia  with Bordj Bouarreridj in eastern Algeria.  This project will alleviate the pressure of the Algiers and Mitija highways.


== History ==
During the Roman Empire there was a Roman town called Malliana, located near Malliana.
In 1848, the French government decided to give this hamlet, the name of Affreville, named after Monsignor Denis Auguste Affre Archbishop of Paris, who died on the barricades.  In 1872, the village became a town.  In 1948 had a population of 12,061 inhabitants (2082 of whom were Europeans).
Khemis-Miliana took its current name in 1963, the year the city hosted the first international fair in Algeria.
