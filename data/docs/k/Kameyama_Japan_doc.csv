== History ==
Kameyama developed as the castle town of Kameyama Castle, which belonged to the Ise-Kameyama Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. In the early 17th century, the castle town was Kameyama-juku, the forty-sixth post station of Tōkaidō. Seki-juku and Sakashita-juku on the Tōkaidō, also fall within its borders.
During the establishment of municipalities in the early Meiji period, Kamayama-juku was organized into the town of Kameyama within Suzuka District. It was elevated to city status on October 1, 1954.
On January 11, 2005, the town of Seki (also from Suzuka District) was merged into Kameyama.
