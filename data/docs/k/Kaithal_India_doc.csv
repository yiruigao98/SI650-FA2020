=== Early and medieval history ===
Timur stopped here in 1398, before attacking Delhi. Later, the city became a Muslim cultural centre, under the rule of Delhi Sultanate. Tombs of several Sufi saints dating from the 13th century can be found in the city today; most important among them is that of Sheikh Salah-ud-din of Bhalkh (1246 CE). The town was renovated and a fort was built during the rule of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar, and as per Ain-i-Akbari, it was a pargana, under the sarkar of Sirhind, and had developed into an agricultural centre.Razia Sultana, the first woman ruler of India, reigned as the Sultana of Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240. She fled Delhi with Malik Altúniya after they were defeated on the 24th of Rabí'u-l awwal A.H. 638 (Oct. 1240), and reached Kaithal the next day, where their remaining forces abandoned them, and were killed on 13 November 1240. The tomb of Rajia Begam is still found here. This aspect is still not well known outside Kaithal, but residents know about the Mazaar of Razia Begum even generations later.
Timur took the town in 1398, with his army massacring or plundering the inhabitants and destroying all villages along the way to Assandh. Many of the residents of Kaithal and the other cities had fled to Delhi in fear.


=== Modern history ===
In 1767, the city fell into the hands of the Singh Krora Misl chieftain, Bhai Desu Singh (d. 1781), who led a large Sikh force from his native village of Bhucho.

By 1808, it came under British influence. The state was ruled by the Scindhia dynasty of the Maratha Empire and paid tributes to the Marathas, until the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost this territory to the British. Bhai Udey Singh ruled over Kaithal and proved to be the last King. Bhai Udey Singh died on 14 March 1843. It became a municipality in 1867. In 1901, the town had a population of 14,408 and was the tehsil in the district of Karnal. The fort of the Bhais is still extant, and their title Bhai became common with the primary Sikh rulers.

It is close to the jail constructed nearby by the present administration. She and her husband Malik Altunia, who was the governor of Bhatinda (Punjab), were decapitated by the local Jat people of the area. It is speculated that she might have been disinterred from Kaithal and then reburied at her tomb in Delhi.
Raziya al-Din (1205  in Budaun  – 13 October 1240), throne name Jalâlat ud-Dîn Raziyâ, usually referred to in history as Razia Sultana, was the Sultan of Delhi in India from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other Muslim princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary. Razia Sultan was the only woman ruler of both the Sultanate and the Mughal period, although other women ruled from behind the scenes.
