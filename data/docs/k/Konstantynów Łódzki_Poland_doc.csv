Konstantynów Łódzki [kɔnstanˈtɨnuf ˈwut͡skʲi] is a town in Pabianice County, Łódź Voivodeship, Poland, with 17,892 inhabitants (2016). It borders Lodz to the east, Lutomiersk to the West, Aleksandrow Lodzki to the North, and Porszewice to the South. It was incorporated in 1924, but was founded in the 1820s by a landowner who had planned to build a textile industry there.
In 1821 Konstantynów Łódzki, at that time still a village, became a part of the textile industry of the Łódź region. Shortly thereafter, in 1824 the town was given its current name and was established as a town in 1830.
