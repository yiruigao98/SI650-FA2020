Kroya Station is a railway station located in Bajing, Kroya, Cilacap Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. The station has nine railway tracks.


== History ==

Kroya Station is estimated to have existed since the construction of the Cilacap-Kroya-Kutoarjo-Yogyakarta railway line on 20 July 1887. The development also included a branch line to Purworejo which opened on the same date.Initially this station consisted only of a main building and a platform that had a canopy that was almost similar to Manggarai Station (see picture). With the increase in the volume of passenger transportation at this station, the station building was later enlarged until it was finally replaced by overcapping in the 1990s. This old canopy, similar to Manggarai Station, appeared in the film Kereta Api Terakhir.
