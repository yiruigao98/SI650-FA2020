== Migration ==

Kairana and Kandhla migration row (also known as Kairana exodus) refers to alleged mass migration of families from Kairana and Kandhla in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh during the period 2014â€“16. Media sources have stated that the migration was due to threats of extortion from Mukim Kala, described as a "gangster." The National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government regarding the migration from Kairana.[1] Bharatiya Janata Party politician Hukum Singh released a list of 346 Hindu families which had migrated from Kairana. On 14 June, he released another list, this time containing the names of migrant families from Kandhla. Both these list and the subsequent response have received extensive media coverage and are expected to play a key role in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, 2017.
Several families have reportedly  deserted the city due to extortion and loot by goons of gangsters like Mukim Kala. Many families have reportedly been forced to shift to nearby Haryana villages due to the terror. Locals said they were getting threats on phone and through letters. If one refuses to give protection money, he is killed by the henchmen. They have no option but to leave the city to save their lives.  However it was also reported that many migrated not because of communalism, but crime.National Human Rights Commission confirmed the exodus in an inquiry which also cited the influx of Muzaffarnagar Riot refugees as exacerbating the harmony in Kairana.
