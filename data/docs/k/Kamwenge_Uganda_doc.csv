The coming of Congolese refugees affected cattle keepers in the area as they were displaced and had to relocate to other places within and outside the district. Land in the refuge settlement is now used for agricultural production especially maize, beans and Irish potatoes; the area has become a business centre attracting traders from the whole country. 
The growth of rural trading centres, which is, attributed to increased road network especially those opened under Development Response to Displacement Impact Project (DRDIP), Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), Uganda Road Fund and UNHCR. This has also created great impact on business opportunities. Similarly, the ongoing rural electrification programme targeting the entire District has increased linear settlements thus changing land use patterns to small-scale informal sector activities like welding, value addition in agriculture and other related occupations.
