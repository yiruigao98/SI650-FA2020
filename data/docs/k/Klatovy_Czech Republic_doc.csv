== History ==
Klatovy was founded during 1260–1263 by Ottokar II of Bohemia.
There are several historic buildings in the town such as the Black Tower, the Baroque Pharmacy, the Jesuit church with catacombs and the Archdeacon's church.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a district office, a museum, a credit union, a hospital, a falconry, a power station, etc. were built.
During World War II, Klatovy was deprived of its natural administrative territory when large parts of Šumava were annexed to the Reich (the border was between Janovice nad Úhlavou and Nýrsko and south of Sušice). At that time, Klatovy was the center of the resistance movement, which was harshly suppressed by the execution of 73 patriots in the Lubský Forest at the time of Heydrich. In 1945, some parts of the city were badly damaged by bombing – the railway station building was completely destroyed. The city was liberated on 5 May 1945 by the US Army.
The town's significant German population was expelled from their home in 1945.
