The administrative divisions of Tanzania are controlled by Part I, Article 2.2 of the Constitution of Tanzania. Tanzania is divided into thirty-one regions (mkoa in Swahili). Each region is subdivided into districts (wilaya in Swahili). The districts are sub-divided into divisions (tarafa in Swahili) and further into local wards (kata in Swahili). Wards are further subdivided for management purposes: for urban wards into streets (mtaa in Swahili) and for rural wards into  villages (kijiji in Swahili). The villages may be further subdivided into hamlets (vitongoji in Swahili).
