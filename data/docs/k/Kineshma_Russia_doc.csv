Kineshma (Russian: Кинешма) is the second largest town in Ivanovo Oblast, Russia, which sprawls for 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) along the Volga River. Population: 88,164 (2010 Census); 95,233 (2002 Census); 105,037 (1989 Census).


== History ==
Kineshma was first noticed as a posad in 1429.  In 1504, Ivan III gave it to Prince Feodor Belsky, who escaped to Moscow from Lithuania and married Ivan's niece. Later on, Ivan the Terrible gave Kineshma to Ivan Petrovich Shuisky, but after the latter's death it was returned to the Tsar in 1587. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Kineshma was a major fishing center, which supplied sturgeon for the Tsar's table. In 1608, it was twice ravaged by the Poles. Throughout its history, Kineshma belonged to different Russian regions, including Archangelgorod Governorate, Yaroslavl Province of Saint Petersburg Governorate, and Moscow Governorate.


== Administrative and municipal status ==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kineshma serves as the administrative center of Kineshemsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the Town of Kineshma—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Kineshma is incorporated as Kineshma Urban Okrug.
