=== WWII ===

Kearns came into existence 1 May 1942 as a World War II United States Army Air Forces training facility known as Kearns Army Air Base (also known as Kearns Center; redesignated: Camp Kearns, 1 January 1944). Before the base was built, the area consisted of dry farms on land reserved for universities and colleges. Construction of the base involved building airplane runways and hangars, with several taxiways and a large parking apron and a control tower. Several hundred buildings were also constructed and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were constructed of temporary or semi-permanent materials. Most support buildings sat on concrete foundations but were of frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper. The thousands of soldiers and airmen stationed there temporarily made the base one of the largest cities in the state. On 15 August 1946, the Air Force deactivated the base and turned the facility over to the State of Utah. The presence of roads and other infrastructure made the area attractive to developers. Houses and businesses sprang up rapidly on what had just a few years earlier been farmland. A theater for "colored personnel" became part of Kearns Junior High School. A base chapel is now part of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church. The base train station is a day-care center. A cannon that had stood next to the headquarters' flagpole stood for many years at the corner of 40th West and 54th South. The airfield part of Kearns Army Air Base today is known as South Valley Regional Airport.


=== Post war and turn of the century ===
Kearns in the mid to late 1900s saw rapid growth in the former airbase. By the 1970s and 1980s suburban development had begun expanding west of the railroad to 5600 west. In 2002 the winter Olympics brought the construction of the Olympic oval at the Oquirrh park before the Olympic oval was built the spot it was built on used to be a running track for Oquirrh park then the Olympic oval was built there for the Olympics and is used today as a tourist attraction and a recreation spot. The last major housing area constructed in Kearns was an area between 5600 west and 6200 south. 


=== 2005-present ===
In 2015 the township of Kearns voted to incorporate as a metro township, a new form of local government that allowed it to elect a council and mayor. Kearns could have also voted to become a city. The following year five council members were elected from five districts and took office in 2017. In 2019 and 2020 more housing was built around Oquirrh park. The Kearns library will be finished by the fall of 2020. Every year in late July and early August there is a parade in Kearns.
