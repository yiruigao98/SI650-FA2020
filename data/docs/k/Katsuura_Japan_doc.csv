== History ==
The area around Katsuura was part of Isumi District of former Kazusa Province. During the Edo period, most of the area was tenryō under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate and administered by hatamoto retainers. Katsuura Village was founded on April 1, 1889. The name is said to be originated from a location of the same name in the Kii Peninsula. It was elevated to town status on March 12, 1890. On April 1, 1937, it expanded through annexation of neighboring Toyohama Village. On February 11, 1955, it expanded further through merger with the neighboring town of Okitsu, and the villages of Ueno and Sono. Katsuura was elevated to city status on October 1, 1958.
In August 1931 the English aviator Francis Chichester crashed his seaplane at Katsuura, hitting cables while doing a demonstration flight for the populace. A local crowd pulled him from the wreckage, and he was healed of serious injuries at a nearby hospital.
