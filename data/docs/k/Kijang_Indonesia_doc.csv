The Toyota Kijang is a series of pickup trucks, light commercial vehicles and multi purpose vehicles sold mainly in Southeast Asia by Toyota. "Kijang", meaning deer/muntjac in Indonesian, was first introduced in Indonesia in 1977 and it had become the most popular car in the country of its time. The same vehicle was introduced earlier in the Philippines as the Toyota Tamaraw, where it was launched in December 1976. Fourth-generation models in the Philippines were sold under the Toyota Revo nameplate. The Kijang is also sold in other countries, and is known as the Toyota Qualis in India and Nepal (third generation), Toyota Zace in Vietnam and Taiwan (third and fourth generation), Toyota Unser in Malaysia (fourth generation) and Toyota Stallion in Africa for the basic models (third and fourth generation), with higher specifications labeled Toyota Venture (third generation) and Toyota Condor in South Africa (fourth generation).
It was relatively affordable in the markets where it was sold when compared to the four-wheel drive vehicles (the Kijang is a rear-wheel drive vehicle) and has high seating capacity, high ground clearance and rugged suspension, popular features in an area with generally poor road conditions and large extended families.
It was manufactured as a CKD (complete knock-down) unit in almost every country it was sold in and many of the parts come from each of the markets in which it was sold. The Kijang was designed with ease of manufacture in mind; in 1986, the assembly of the Kijang only cost 42 percent of the cost of assembling the much smaller EE80 Corolla.


== First generation (F10; 1976) ==
The Kijang prototype was first displayed at the 1975 Jakarta Fair and then entered production in 1977. Its development was led by Osamu Ohta with Ohyama as the chief engineer in 1972. The first generation Kijang is a compact, light pickup truck powered by a carburetted 1.2-litre 3K four-cylinder OHV petrol engine matched to a 4-speed manual transmission. A pickup variant with rear body and roof was also produced. The Kijang Minibus (van/wagon version) was built by a local company.
The Kijang first entered the Indonesian market on 9 June 1977, although it had been on sale in the Philippines since 2 December 1976. It has a boxy design with externally hinged half doors and plastic/canvas windows. Designated KF10, it shared the 3K engine with the 1972 Corolla, coupled to a 4-speed manual transmission. It was colloquially nicknamed 'Kijang Buaya' (meaning "Crocodile Kijang") as the engine hood resembled a crocodile's mouth once opened. The KF10 Kijang sold 26,806 units in its 4 years of production when it would be replaced by the second generation model.


=== Tamaraw (Philippines) ===
In the Philippines, the Kijang was sold as the Tamaraw (named for one of the country's national animals, the Tamaraw), produced in the 1970s up to early 1980s. Introduced in December 1976, it started as a small ​3⁄4 ton high-side pick-up (HSPU) with a 1.2-litre 3K engine producing 41 kW (55 hp; 56 PS), and was produced by the now-defunct Delta Motors, which assembled Toyota vehicles in the Philippines. It was considered as a "BUV", or "Basic Utility Vehicle". It had a 4-speed manual transmission, and some models had no driver- or front passenger-side doors. Because of its ruggedness and ease of maintenance, even its upgradability (some swap the 3K engine with a more powerful engine, usually a diesel engine or any in Toyota's K series of engines), some of these vehicles survive today, and its designs are sometimes copied or modified by local assemblers to this day. It was proven success that General Motors (through Francisco Motors), Ford and Chrysler (with Mitsubishi) created their own versions of the BUV, including the two versions of the Pinoy and the Ford Fiera and Chrysler-Mitsubishi Cimarron.
The KF10 Tamaraw was also imported and distributed in Papua New Guinea in 1980 by Ela Motors, a division of the Burns Philip Group. The vehicle was renamed to Toyota Traka and was described as "using the same engine as the popular Toyota Corolla, the Traka is a basic utility vehicle capable of carrying a payload of 750 kg (1,653 lb) and developing more than 60 hp".

		


== Second generation (F20/F30; 1981) ==
The second generation Kijang (designated KF20) retained its boxy style although the body panels were different. It is colloquially called the 'Kijang Doyok' in Indonesia. Under its slimmer hood was a 1.3-litre 4K engine, which was replaced in December 1985 by a 1.5-litre 5K engine. The only transmission option was a 4-speed manual. With the 5K engine, the power increased from 44 kW (59 hp; 60 PS) to 53 kW (71 hp; 72 PS), both at 5,600 rpm. The 1986 model can be seen from the outside by rectangular headlamps and a redesigned grille. The Kijang started selling very strongly in 1983 and 1984, catching up to erstwhile market leaders such as the Suzuki Super Carry and the Daihatsu Hijet. The more powerful Kijang offered more carrying capacity, while the engine placement made it safer than its cheaper, kei truck-based competitors. In February 1985, the 100,000th Kijang left the production line.In the Philippines, the Tamaraw was also sold as the long-wheelbase F30 series, which was also promoted as an alternative to the jeepney. A local Philippine auto brand, Dragon, later took the designs of the long-wheelbase Tamaraw and marketed it. Pilipinas Nissan bought the designs from Ford (after their exit in 1984) for what would have been the Fiera IV and marketed it as the "Bida" ("protagonist" in Tagalog), which resembles the long-wheelbase Tamaraw.


== Third generation (F40/F50; 1986) ==
Introduced in November 1986, the third generation Kijang was offered in short-wheelbase (F40 series) and long-wheelbase (F50 series) versions. The Kijang was redesigned to be larger and heavier, and no longer prioritized as a pickup truck-based model. The Standard trim level had a 4-speed manual transmission, while the Super variant had a 5-speed manual transmission and a better-equipped interior. Introduced in this generation was "Full Pressed Body" wagon built by companies appointed by Toyota. This technique were applied to reduce usage of putties up to 2–5 kg (4–11 lb) for each car.
The Kijang received its first facelift in August 1992. The steering mechanism was changed from recirculating ball to rack and pinion.  The wagon model received a right-side rear door and adopted a new name, "Toyota Original Body", instead of "Full Pressed Body". In its creation process, it was fully pressed and used pointed welding. Up to this time, this model can be said as the one and only putty-free Kijang. The trim levels for the wagon model were:

Standard (SX and LX; KF42 and KF52): a base model Kijang with 4-speed manual transmission, standard dashboard, and no power features.
Deluxe (SSX and LSX; KF42 and KF52): an upgraded version of the base Kijang with a refined dashboard, better quality interior materials, steel rims with center caps, single air conditioning, basic audio system with a radio receiver, with alloy wheel was available as an option.
Deluxe G(SSX-G and LSX-G; KF42 and KF52) Adds power steering and seatbelts as standard equipment
Grand Extra (SGX and LGX; KF42 and KF52): the top-of-the-range model with double blower air conditioning, alloy wheels, suede-covered door trim and seats, power steering, front power windows, digital clock, tachometer, 4 speaker audio system with a tape deck and radio receiver (CD player available as optional), alarm and power locks.
Kijang Rover is a coach-built model with a restyled body resembling the 70-series Land Cruiser available either as a 4 door(Rover) or 5 Door(Grand Rover) wagon in either short or long wheelbase. Front Reclining seats and folding middle seats are standard on all trims while super variants include headrests, Console Box, and footsteps as standard equipment. Air conditioning and a radio/cassette are available as options. Power steering was later added with the 1992 refresh with the 4 door rover model subsequently being discontinued and the model name was later changed to "RoverAce" after receiving objections from the British automobile manufacturer Rover
Kijang Jantan is the higher-end trim variant to the Kijang Rover that was first introduced in executive trim which added wood trim, power windows to all four seats, front and rear air conditioning, 4 speaker audio system, central locking, and alloy wheels. An entry-level G variant and a 4x2 (short only) sporty variant was introduced alongside the original executive variant. The 4x2 adds a larger rear door that covers the full width of the vehicle and a door-mounted spare wheel, however it does not have rear air conditioning.
Kijang Kencana (KF42 and KF52): a coach-built model based on Kijang Rover/Jantan with higher roof and higher ground clearance. This model retains the side-opening rear door of low roof models instead of the liftgate received by international high roof models.
Kijang Perkasa:A 2 door Wagon coach-built model with a removable fiberglass canopyIn April 1995, the Kijang received a second facelift, including a redesigned grille, usage of Enkei 14-inch alloy wheels, redesigned steering wheel, addition of tachometers for Deluxe trim, and larger 1.8-liter 7K engine. With the introduction of the 7K engine, the production of the 5K engine was completely stopped. On 17 August 1995, 4-speed automatic transmission was introduced as an optional modification for the SGX and LGX models for the first time in the Kijang. This 1995–1996 version was an anniversary model and was relatively expensive—it cost Rp 100,000,000 at the time.

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


=== Tamaraw FX (Philippines) ===

In the Philippines, versions of the Kijang were sold as the Tamaraw FX when it was introduced in the 1993. The Tamaraw FX was available either with a 1.8-litre 7K petrol engine or a 2.0-litre 2C diesel engine, all coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission. Power was 59 kW (79 hp; 80 PS) and 51 kW (68 hp; 69 PS) respectively, allowing for top speeds of 130 or 125 km/h (81 or 78 mph). The Tamaraw FX was offered in 5 door long wheelbase wagon in either Standard, Deluxe and GL trim levels. The GL trim included power steering, cloth interior, cloth seats, a digital clock, door pocket, a 4 speaker cassette radio, body cladding and 14 inch alloy wheels. Deluxe and standard models had steel wheels, 2 speaker cassette decks, and vinyl interiors, however deluxe models received full width side steps and bucket front seats. Dual AC was standard on all wagon models. The pick up variant was available in 11-seater high side pickup form and later in chassis cab configuration. In 2000, Deluxe, GL, and diesel wagon variants were discontinued leaving only the 1.8 standard wagon and pickup variants to be sold alongside the Revo until 2002 when the Tamaraw is finally discontinued.
The Tamaraw FX was meant for use as a passenger wagon. It still retained the ruggedness of the old Tamaraw and is ideal for rough roads and carrying heavy loads. It was assembled by Toyota Motor Philippines. Also around this time, after Ford left the Philippines in 1984, Pilipinas Nissan bought the rights to produce the Fiera IV under the name Nissan Bida; and local car assembler Carter Motors came up with their own version, the Masa (Tagalog for "masses", implying that the car is within reach of the masses).


=== Zace (Vietnam and Taiwan) ===
The Kijang was sold in Vietnam and Taiwan under the Zace name. Introduced in Taiwan in 1988 the station wagon model was offered in either low roof long-wheelbase wagon with regular side-opening rear door and a high roof version lift gate variant while a pickup variant was also offered with a choice of either a 1.5L (5K) or 1.8 (7K)engine. The Taiwanese market Zace wagons was offered in either 5/8 seater configurations. The Vietnamese market Zace only had an 8-seater configuration.

		
		


=== Venture/Stallion (South Africa) ===

The Kijang was built and sold in South Africa in three body styles as the High roof station wagon Venture, or as a commercial vehicle under the Stallion nameplate available either as a panel van or pickup truck. The advertising campaign for the Stallion had local Afrikaans comedian Tolla Van Der Merwe, and because of his popularity it is commonly called the "Tolla bakkie".
The Venture was available with three engine choices: a 1.8(2Y) petrol, 2.2(4Y) petrol, and a 2.4(2L) diesel. Standard equipment includes Gear lock, Rear wiper and Washer, Power steering (unavailable on 1.8 Engined Ventures), Air conditioning (available for 2.2 Engined models only), and a ten-seat configuration.2.2 Engine models also include an immobilizer alarm as standard(optional on 1.8 and 2.4D models) while the range-topping 2.2 GLE adds a 9-seater configuration, central locking, and makes a cassette radio standard equipment (optional on other variants).

=== Qualis (India) ===

The 3rd generation Kijang was launched in India on January 2000 as Toyota's first entry into India's automobile market following a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group in 1997.The Kijang was sold in India under the Qualis name. The Qualis was based on the third generation global model, but updated with front and rear styling, an updated interior making use of the switch gear, instrument cluster and rear air conditioning blower unit from the 4th generation kijang. Critics said the vehicle was outdated that came with an awkward design (non-aerodynamic) and did not expect it to sell well. However, Qualis was a hit as the vehicle was welcomed by taxi, fleet operators and large Indian families over others like Tata's Sumo and Mahindra's Bolero. The Qualis was initially sold only with a 2.4-liter 2L-II SOHC diesel upon its introduction in 2000 in FS/GS/GST trims whlie the fuel-injected 2.0-litre 1RZ-E SOHC petrol engine was later made available in the range topping GST Super. The FS model(10 seater) is the base trim with a spartan vinyl interior with power steering and front air conditioning (later included in refreshed models as standard ) as options. The middle grade GS trim (10 seater/8 seater) gets better cloth interior with better sound deadening, power steering, front air conditioning (Rear AC available as an option), and body cladding as standard with power windows and central locking offered as options. The Top end 8 seater GST and the petrol GST Super included front fog lamps, rear wiper and washer, wood trim, rear spoiler, alloy wheels, and all GS options as standard.The model range would get revamped in 2002 that brought roll down windows to the 2nd row doors with power windows for all 4 doors and central locking being standard to the now 8 seater only GS variant with rear AC and rear wiper and washer offered as options while the range topping GST/GST super would get replaced by a new 7-seater RS variant with captain seats.   The Toyota Qualis would get replaced by the toyota Innova in 2005skipping the fourth Generation Kijang entirely.


== Fourth generation (F60/F70/F80; 1997) ==


=== Indonesia ===
In January 1997, the fourth generation Kijang was launched with a more rounded, aerodynamic shape. It was originally planned to be introduced in 2000, but since Mitsubishi wanted to push the Kuda in 1998, it was instead launched three years in advance. It was more powerful and more refined than its predecessors. The wagon model, often colloquially known as "Kijang Kapsul" (meaning "Capsule Kijang"), was designated either the F70 series (short wheelbase) or the F80 series (long wheelbase), and features a rear liftgate rather than a side-opening rear door, with some coachbuild versions still retain the latter. The pickup model was designated as the F60 series. For the first time, the 2L diesel-powered Kijang was offered and later became the most popular model. Either the carburetted 7K or the fuel-injected 7K-E-powered Kijang was also the most popular model due to its low maintenance cost, despite being underpowered compared to the 2.0-litre 1RZ-E unit. It was built on the same platform as the sixth-generation Hilux.
The fourth generation wagon model Kijangs were generally released in four different trim levels, depending on wheelbase options:

SX (F70/71/72) and LX (F80/81/82): Base model without air conditioning, cassette tape player, power windows, tachometer, sun visor and other amenities. The 1997-2000 model have a fixed front passenger seat and a 4-speed manual transmission.
SSX (F70/71/72) and LSX (F80/81/82): Standard model,  equipped with air conditioning, cassette tape player and tachometer.
SGX (F70/71/72) and LGX (F80/81/82): Deluxe model, equipped with double-blower air conditioning, cassette tape/CD player, power windows, alloy wheels, rear window wiper and exterior garnish. A 4-speed automatic transmission option is also offered in the LGX model, being the first Kijang to have an automatic transmission.
Rangga (F70): Sports edition for the short wheelbase model, similar to SSX trim but equipped with SUV-inspired body kit, higher ground clearance, rear-mounted spare tyre and refined interior with suede seat cover and door trim. This trim is only offered in the 1997–2000 model.
Krista (F80/81/82): Sports edition for the long wheelbase model, similar to LGX trim but only available in blue, red, black, silver or green colour option, equipped with body kit and refined interior; the trim also included specially-made door trim and center console. Unlike the LGX, the 1997–2000 Krista trim had no automatic transmission option.
Limited Krista (F80/81/82): extra spare tire mount from the "Rangga" and came with a 4-speed automatic. it was not confirmed how much were built, but can be identified by factory Invoice and other paperworksThe pickup model was offered in Standard Deck and Flat Deck variants.
Some versions called Grand Rover Ace and Jantan Raider, which were made by local coachbuilders, was also sold only in a few units. The Grand Rover Ace is based on the LSX trim and has an SUV-like body, resembling the J80 series Land Cruiser.
The Short wheelbase wagon has a 7-seat capacity using jumpseats in the rear while the 8-seater Long wheelbase wagon uses a bench type front facing third row seats albeit without seatbelts.The fourth generation Kijang has undergone several changes:

Pre-facelift (January 1997 – November 1999): The bumpers and side skirts are still made of steel. The window was still equipped with a rubber seal. It used either a 1.8-litre 7K petrol engine or a 2.4-litre 2L diesel engine option. The lowest trim, SX and LX, is offered with a 4-speed manual transmission as opposed to 5-speed seen in higher trims. Automatic transmission option was only available in the LGX trim.First facelift (December 1999 – August 2002): Thinner body-steel was used to decrease production cost; therefore, this model was sold as the same price as the pre-facelift model. The front and rear fascias got some redesigns. It used compound sealant for the rear window, while the front windscreen was still using rubber seals. The design of the front panel was slightly changed (mostly on the driver's side). For this model (and upwards) customers could choose which engine option they wanted to use –  a 1.8-litre 7K-E petrol engine, a 2.0-litre 1RZ-E petrol engine or a 2.4-litre 2L diesel engine. The 2.0-litre engine option was offered in the LGX and Krista trims from 6 September 2000 (introduced at the 10th Gaikindo Auto Expo). The DLX trim got Enkei 14-inch alloy as an option. The SX/LX trim received a 5-speed manual transmission, and automatic transmission is made available on the Krista trim.
Second facelift (August 2002 – September 2004): The grille received a redesign with vertical slats and the rear fascia is equipped with rear garnish in some variants. Both LGX and Krista trims are equipped with suede door trim (the older model ones used cloth trim) and the rear power window buttons are integrated to the door armrests. The interior changed into full beige colour (the older models' colour is mostly grey). Engine Choices Include the 1.8 7K for the Pickup and Standard Grade Wagon(SX/LX) paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, the fuel injected 1.8 7K-E in DLX(SSX/LSX) and GL(SGX/LGX) wagon trims with an optional 4- speed automatic transmission available in the GL trim, the 2.0 1RZ-E is only offered in long wheelbase form only in GL and Krista trim levels in either manual or automatic transmission options and, a 2.4 2L Diesel is available in all long wheelbase wagon trims and pickup bodystyles with a 5 speed manual as the sole transmission option.The production of fourth generation Kijang passenger wagon ended in September 2004 with a total production of 452,017 units. The pickup truck variant continued to sold until February 2007.

		
		
		
		
		
		
		


=== Unser (Malaysia) ===
The fourth generation Kijang was sold in Malaysia as the Unser between mid-1998 to May 2005 when it was replaced by the Innova. The Unser is only offered in an 8 seater configuration with seatbelts for all three rows available as Standard. Initially offered with either a 2.4 2L Diesel engine or a 1.8 7K-E gasoline engine and a 5-speed manual transmission, beginning in July 2000, an automatic variant was available with the 1.8 7K-E engine. In April 2001, a facelift was introduced. Changes included new multi-reflector headlamps, integrated spotlights into the front bumper, clear lenses with coloured bulbs for the taillights and a new steering wheel designavailable in either Gasoline(GLi) or Diesel trims.(GLD). For 2003, the Unser was updated again and now only available with the 1.8 7K-E engine in two trim levels: GLi and LGX incorporating new exterior design, suede interior trim, 50/50 front facing third row seats(instead of a removable bench in previous models)  with the new LGX trim adding power mirrors, chrome trim and body cladding.

=== Revo (Philippines) ===
1998–2000 (F80)The fourth generation Kijang was sold in the Philippines under the Tamaraw FX Revo nameplate. The model was introduced in 1998 to replace the Tamaraw FX (though it was sold alongside it for a while). The platform and diesel engine were based from the similar era Hilux. Engine choices include a 1.8-litre EFI for the petrol engine and 2.4-litre diesel engine. Trim levels available are the DLX (entry level), GL, GLX, SR (Sport Runner), the high-end LXV, VX200 and the limited edition SR-J and VX200-J (part of Toyota's series of J, or Japan-spec, vehicles, which extended to the Hilux, the HiAce, and the RAV4). The LXV trim was discontinued in the 2000 model year in favor of the VX200, while the GSX is a whole new variant. Facelifted versions were introduced in 2002; two J-spec trim lines (SR-J and VX200-J) were retired from the line, and higher-end trim versions received upgraded leather seating, entertainment systems and appointments.
The DLX has a vinyl interior, a two spoke steering wheel, a two-speaker radio/tape set-up and steel wheels with center ornaments. The GL trim has steel wheels with hubcaps, a four speaker radio/tape set-up and a fabric interior. The GLX, SR and LXV has a six speaker radio/tape set-up, fog lamps, alloy wheels, a rear wiper and all power amenities. Body graphics are exclusive to the SR and LXV only. The LXV had gold-trimmed badges. The SR has the word "Sport Runner" written in a font set similar to the one used for the Supra. It sold very well, in 1998 it accumulated a total sales of 7,700 units. Safety features were basic such as safety belts, load sensing proportioning valve, child-proof door locks and door impact beams.
The first released diesel powered Revo was notorious for being a smoke belcher, even among other diesels at that time, with some complaints from owners. Despite this, Mazda, Ford and Isuzu released competing models, most notably the Isuzu Hi-Lander and its popular variant the Crosswind.

		
2000–2002 (F80/F81)For 2000, Toyota revised the Revo, with badge changes and trim line revamp. Engine choices include the newly introduced 2.0-litre SOHC EFI and 1.8-litre EFI petrol engines as well as a 2.4-litre OHC direct-injection diesel engine. The 2.4-litre diesel engine has been revised to address smoke-belching complaints.
The Revo received a facelift, featuring clear halogen headlamps, new wheels, new interiors and availability of new colours. Trim levels include the DLX (entry level), GL, GSX, GLX, SR (Sport Runner), VX200 and the limited edition SR-J and VX200-J (part of Toyota's series of J, or Japan-spec, vehicles, which extended to the Hilux and the RAV4). The VX line eventually replaced the LXV; and the GSX is a whole new variant.
The DLX, the entry level, has only power steering, and no other power features. This variant lacks a tachometer, and is equipped only with a tape deck/radio receiver, 2 speakers in the front row only, vinyl interior and it has 14-inch steel wheels with center ornament. The GL is the "higher-end entry level" with radio-CD setup, fabric interior, tachometer, and steel wheels with hubcaps. The remaining lines has all-power features, CD player/radio receiver and six-speaker setup (but upgradable to a DVD player setup), as well as rear-window defoggers. The VX and SR-J lines have leather seats and TV screens mounted on the dashboard and on the headrests. Only the SR-J, a special version of the SR (distinct wheels, unique livery), the GSX and the VX200 and VX200J had 2.0-litre petrol engines and automatic power fender-mounted radio antennas. Front-facing third-row seats were made as an option albeit without three-point seatbelts, a rarity for the vehicle type at that time in the Philippines.

2003–2005 (F82)DLX, GL were the bottom trims to choose from while GLX, GSX and SR variants were considered the mid-range players. The VX240D (2L 2.4diesel) was introduced to the new lineup in mid-2004. The Revo received its third and last refreshing. The J series of Toyota vehicles were discontinued, hence the discontinuation of its two J-spec trim lines (SR-J and VX200-J). It received a badge revision, availability of new colors and exterior and interior details, including a 3 spoke steering wheel with a chrome Toyota logo, larger headlamps and foglamps, Land Cruiser style tail lamps (which are present in the fourth generation Kijang), upgraded audio systems and other additional features. The top trim (VX200 and VX240D) received upgraded and reengineered adjustable leather seats, 2-tone leather door sidings, upgraded entertainment systems (motorized 2-din head unit with AVG input for the middle row seat's armrest -also in wood accent. Some have claimed they played Play Station 2 on the headrest monitors), wood panel appointments, side-steps (together with the SR trim) and upgraded dual DVD headrest monitors. Only VX200 variants were given a 12-volt auxiliary power outlet with cover in the left side of last row. The VX200 and SR variants were offered in fabric or leather options for the interior. For the SR, chrome appointments on the dashboard, a new livery was introduced, as well as the words "SPORT RUNNER" executed in plain text, discontinuing the use of the font used for the Supra. GLX and GSX trims received new wheels and different livery for the GSX.
It had good sales expectations but was discontinued in 2005 likely due to Toyota's IMV project. The last Revos were either sold to rental fleets, police departments, or people who want to snap the last few examples, until February 2005. To date, we can still see a bunch of them in the streets. Some are up for auction from government agencies and some for dropping from rental fleets like Taxis. Their resale value also do not go down that easy because of its reputation for being very reliable and having been considered as the best AUV in the Philippines.

		
		


=== Zace Surf (F60/F84/F85 - Taiwan/Vietnam)/Condor (F80/F81/F85 - South Africa)/Stallion (F60 - South Africa) ===

== Replacement ==

Due to its diversified roles in its respective markets the Kijang was succeeded by the Avanza and Toyota IMV platform vehicles.
Toyota replaced the Kijang station wagon across Southeast Asia with the smaller Avanza in 2003, and the larger Innova in 2004. The latter has been retailed by Toyota Astra Motor in Indonesia as the "Kijang Innova" to retain its linkage with the original model. Toyota categorize the Innova as the fifth and sixth generation Kijang. The Kijang pickup was sold until early 2007, when it was replaced by the Hilux pickup truck to comply with the Euro 2 emission standards.The Indian market Qualis was replaced by the Innova, skipping the fourth generation model entirely.The Malaysian market Unser was sold alongside the Avanza introduced in late 2004 until the middle of 2005, when it was discontinued in favor of the Innova being introduced.The Innova was marketed in 2005 as the successor to the Revo in the Philippine market with marketing material referring to the Innova as "A Beautiful [R]evolution" referencing the Revo nameplate. Given the family oriented nature of the Innova, taxi and commercial businesses served previously by the entry-level DLX and GL Revo trims were now served by the Avanza, while the upmarket SR and VX trims now being catered to by the Fortuner SUV. Commercial variants of the Tamaraw FX were succeeded by the  Hilux FX window van, carrying over the "FX" nameplate, and the Hilux Cargo panel van.
The Taiwanese Zace Surf was replaced with the Innova equipped with the 2.7 L 2TR-FE petrol engine with no replacement for the four-wheel-drive variant and pickup truck. The Fortuner, then codenamed IMV4, was slated to be imported by local distributor Hotai Motors as to reflect the Zace Surf's then current lineup however due to strategic consideration by Toyota, the Innova was launched in 2007 instead with the 2TR-FE to meet emission regulations with the smaller 1TR-FE being introduced later to replace the larger engine. In 2016, the Innova was discontinued from the Taiwanese market with the second generation Innova not slated to be imported.The Africa/Ghana market Condor was replaced by the Fortuner in 2006, Avanza in 2007 and Innova introduced in late 2011, while panel van duties served by the African market Stallion were passed onto a panel van version of the Avanza introduced in late 2013. The second generation Innova is not slated to be introduced to the South African market due to shrinking MPV market and poor sales.
