== History ==

Korydallos was founded in ancient times, and was one of the 100 municipalities of ancient Athens' democratic system at the end of the 6th century BC. Theophilos Corydalleus (1563–1646) was a philosopher who lived in Corydallos. 200 years later, Korydallos was known as Koutsoukari after the property owner of the greater area, Emmanouil Koutsikaris. After that it was renamed into Pachy after the next owner (Pachinas). In 1923, the town was renamed back into its ancient name, Korydallos. The population in 1928 was 2,500. Korydallos was part of the municipality of Piraeus until 1934, when it became a separate community. It was elevated to municipality status in 1946. The city now boasts a population of 63,000.
