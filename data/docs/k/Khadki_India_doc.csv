Khadki is a town near Pune in Maharashtra, India. Once a city neighborhood and a cantonment adjoining Pune, it is now a quasi-metropolis.


== Description ==
Khadki could be considered an Indian Army base, along with an ordnance factory consisting of two ammunition factories, a Military Vehicle Depot (Central Armed Forces Vehicle Depot, CAFVD) and the Military Dairy Farm.
Referred to previously as Kirkee during the British Raj, its borders are flanked by two other large army establishments—the College of Military Engineering at Dapodi and the Bombay Engineering Group.
It also has a war cemetery (Kirkee War Cemetery) and a war memorial. It has a large market—Khadki Bazaar—and a railway station which was connected to the Ammunition Factory, but which link was shut down in the 1960s. Khadki had a large number of open areas which were converted by CAFVD into playing fields for both Field Hockey and soccer (Football), with as many as four of the former and two of the latter, thereby becoming a bastion of hockey. All tournaments in Pune were played there, on dust grounds that were watered prior to a match. As it expanded, Pune built stadiums for both these sports. Local Association Football and Field Hockey matches are held on the CAFVD Sports Stadium in front of the Khadki Railway Station west exit towards old Mumbai Pune highway. Field Hockey matches are also held on the main road from Khadki to the Ordnance Factory, better known as Ammunition Factories. One pair of Football and Hockey fields has since been converted into residential areas, bordered by St Joseph's Convent Girls School on Burr Road, General Thorat Road and the old Pune-Mumbai Road. Khadki is surrounded on three sides by the Mula River, starting from Bopodi/Dapodi, past the War Cemetery, joining the Mutha River at what is known as Sangamwadi. Two historic bridges add to its military background, the low-lying Holkar Bridge and the Sangam Double Bridges- one for rail and the other for road traffic. Two more bridges have been added since 2005, one replacing Holkar Bridge as it would invariably be submerged in the monsoons and the other to shorten the distance from Deccan College area to Poona Engineering College and Deccan Gymkhana. Khadki has as many as seven military officer's messes.
