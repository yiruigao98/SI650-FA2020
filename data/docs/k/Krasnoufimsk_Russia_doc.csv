== History ==
It was founded in 1736 as Krasnoufimskaya fortress that would defend the Ural manufactures from the raids of nearby tribes; it was granted the status of chief town of uyezd in 1781. In the beginning of the 18th century, the majority of the residents were Cossacks, bourgeois, and merchants of the third guild.
One of the main issues of the 19th century was the remoteness of Krasnoufimsk from the major cities of Perm and Yekaterinburg, and thus railroad. The town did not have any other transport links apart from unpaved roads and the river Ufa. Amongst its main economic activities at that time agriculture was considered one of the most valuable. The town's authorities strived to boost the development of industrial, agricultural, educational and medical sectors during the last quarter of 19th century by inviting some of the renowned specialists. On June 1, 1875, the first six-form real school was founded. Students could specialize either in mining or agricultural sciences.
In 1915, a railway station was finally built in Krasnoufimsk, and in 1916, railroad service was launched.
In 1930, Krasnoufimsk became the center of a large agricultural district. Significant investments in its infrastructure provided the town with a machine and tractor station, agriproducts processing plants, selective station, and other agriculture related enterprises.
During World War II, some of factories and plants were evacuated from the western regions of the Soviet Union, which amongst others included: All-Union Institute of Plant Cultivation; Kharkov Institute of Mechanics and Machine-Building; Rostov and Ryazan factories.
During the later half of the 20th century town's authorities carried on the development of comfortable housing, and agribusiness infrastructure.
