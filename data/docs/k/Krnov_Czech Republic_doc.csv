Krnov (Czech pronunciation: [ˈkr̩nof]; German: Jägerndorf, Polish: Karniów or Krnów, Latin: Carnovia) is a town in Bruntál District in the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 23,000 inhabitants. It lies in the historical region of Upper Silesia, at the confluence of the rivers Opava and Opavice, near the Polish border.


== History ==
The area has been inhabited almost without interruption since the stone age. Its history stretches back to the 13th century when Krnov acquired town rights. The town was first mentioned in 1240 and served as the capital of an independent duchy from 1377 to 1523. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland.
According to the Austrian census of 1910, the town had 16,681 inhabitants, 15,647 of whom had permanent residence there. The census had asked people for their native language; 15,390 (98.4%) were German-speaking and 247 (1.5%) were Czech-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish, thus most of them declared German as their native language. The most populous religious groups were Roman Catholics with 15,290 (91.7%), followed by Protestants with 885 (5.3%) and the Jews with 459 (2.8%). After World War II the German population was expelled in 1945-46, completely altering the traditional language and culture of the town and its region.
