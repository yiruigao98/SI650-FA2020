== Housing conditions ==
Due to the hilly topography and the frequent rains, the town lacks effective drainage systems. The only sewerage formerly in the Daraja Mbili area has been moved to Suneka area.
There is an acute shortage of land and most of its suburbs have developed without proper planning. However, aside from the existing housing estates owned by the municipality and private owned homes, there are new housing estates coming up in Nyanchwa neighborhood owned by the government's housing agency. Many residents owning private homes and flats can be found all over the municipality and its precinct areas such as organized suburbs or municipality wards such as Milimani, Gesonso, Itierio, Nyangena, Nyamataro, Mwembe Tayari, Gekomu, Menyinkwa, Nyabururu, Embassy and Nyanchwa. These are regarded as middle- to upper-middle-class neighborhoods with many modern private homes on freehold areas and apartments. The lower- to middle-class neighborhoods and outlying residential areas include Suneka, Jogoo, Getare, Menyinkwa and Nyankongo which entail a large and diverse population.
Most of all, the main reason for the few housing estates in the municipality limits is scarcity of land and many residents' preference for owner-occupancy homes over purchasing flats or homes built by the government or the municipality. The settlements consist of regular village homes as well more organized modern suburban and freehold homes. The effects of the post-election violence of 2007-8 contributed lately to the rise of private home construction and migration of residents from other major cities and towns such as nearby Kisumu, Kericho, Sotik, and as far away as Eldoret, Kitale, and Nakuru. This situation encouraged a mass exodus from these towns and diaspora residents fleeing persecution fearing inter-tribal stigmatization into the town for their own safety.

=== Parks ===

A portion of larger Kisii Golf Club's course was open for public recreation by the local authority for a couple of years. This area was later consolidated back to the golf course. Immediate availability of land for commercial or residential development has been the greatest challenge facing its longtime residents and potential investors. Lately, this impediment has been addressed by the local authority.
Kisii Golf has experienced major challenges from encroachment through illegal farming activities. The area has since been fenced to control public encroachment. As a result, the area has improved and further developed into a bird sanctuary..
The Kisii Sports Club which claims to have responsibility of managing the golf has put up adequate and viable legislation to govern the green space. Enabling the development of local sport talent and often doubling up as a helipad for visitors.
