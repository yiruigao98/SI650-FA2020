The main function of the state is the establishment of fair and just rules of social life (rules of the game). The basis of these rules is the ideological values of Ukrainians – liberties, self-sufficiency and the aspiration of wealth. He believes that "the economy of success is wealth through opportunities".
His life credo: first: in all its problems one must blame exclusively for himself, and not for anyone else; the second: every day you have to live so that the next morning you cannot be afraid to look in the mirror in your own eyes; the third: we must confidently go to the goal, to gather like-minded people and to change the world around us together.
