Although there are many tumuli and hill towns which give information of history of the region before the invention of writing, due to absence of scientific analysis, there is not sufficient information. However, as to archeological researches which were done around Eskipazar and Ovacık,  the earliest site in this region is Yazıboy, which is a village of Eskipazar nowadays.  Researches think that one of tumulus in this village reach today from b.c. 2500.
