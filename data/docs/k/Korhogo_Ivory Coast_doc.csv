== Civil War history ==
On 19 September 2002, Korhogo and Bouaké were seized by disaffected former soldiers, calling themselves "Patriotic Movement of Côte d'Ivoire" (Mouvement Patriotique de Côte d'Ivoire - MPCI),
rebelling against the rule of President Laurent Gbagbo. The coup was allegedly led by Robert Guéï, the former military dictator overthrown in a popular uprising in 2000. Despite the formal cessation of hostilities between the government and rebels in 2003, Korhogo remains unstable, with continued fighting between rival factions. In June 2004, forces loyal to rebel leader Guillaume Soro claimed that his Paris-based rival Ibrahim Coulibaly had attempted to assassinate Soro, leading to gun battles which left 22 dead in Korhogo. In August 2004, the United Nations' Ivorian mission announced that three mass graves, containing at least 99 bodies, had been discovered in the town.
On 29 November 2011, the Associated Press reported that Gbagbo had been under house arrest in Korhogo and was awaiting extradition to The Hague to face charges at the International Criminal Court.
