== History ==

Köping means merchant place. It was mentioned for the first time in the 13th century.  It was probably given such a name as it did not yet have a charter. The central location of Köping deems it appropriate for merchancy for people from different parts of the country.
Köping, with central and southern Sweden was Christianised in the 11th century. A church built around the year 1300, the Köping Church, still remains from the early days.
Köping got its charter on January 19, 1474.
In the 17th century Köping municipality produced large amounts of iron that was transported to other countries.
In the 19th century Köping established itself as an industrial city, with a large mechanical workshop and a prosperous harbor. A fire in 1889 destroyed large parts of Köping, whereafter it was rebuilt using stone material under supervision of architect Theodor Dahl.
In the 20th century all kinds of companies have established themselves in Köping. Volvo built a large industry there in the 1920s; the arguably most known bed manufacturer in Sweden, Hästens, in 1924; and a number of gold groceries between 1940-1960.
