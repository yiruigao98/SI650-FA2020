== History ==
In the 6th century, the Shofukuji tomb (勝福寺古墳) was built.
In the 10th century, Minamoto no Mitsunaka (源満仲), samurai court official, and grandson of Emperor Seiwa (清和天皇) retired to Tada (多田) village, now part of Kawanishi. This area became the base of his descendants, Seiwa Genji (清和源氏), which established the Kamakura shogunate. A statue of him can be seen next to Kawanishi-Ikeda Station.
In the 11th century, the Tada silver-and-copper mine started. And in the 17th century it was at its peak.
In 1884, Mitsuya Cider was first made.
In 1913, Kawanishi-Noseguchi Station was opened.
Kawanishi was incorporated on August 1, 1954 out of the former Kawanishi Town (川西町), Tada Village (多田村) and Higashitani Village (東谷村).
