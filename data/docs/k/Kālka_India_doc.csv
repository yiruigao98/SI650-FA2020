Kalka is a town in the Panchkula district of Haryana, India. The name of this town is derived from the Hindu goddess Kali. The town is situated in the foothills of the Himalayas and is a gateway to the neighbouring state of Himachal Pradesh.

To the south of Kalka is Pinjore, and the industrial village of Parwanoo (Himachal Pradesh) is to the north on the NH 22.

In 2013, the municipal committee of Kalka was dissolved and the administration was reassigned to Panchkula Municipal Corporation.
