Mueang Kabin Buri was an ancient city of the Ayutthaya kingdom. The city hall was in Ban Hanuman. In 1906 the city hall was moved to Ban Paknam, the area where the Hanuman and Phra Prong Rivers join together to become the Bang Pakong River. On 1 April 1926 the province was abolished and the two districts, Mueang Kabin Buri and Aranyapathret, became districts of Prachinburi Province.
