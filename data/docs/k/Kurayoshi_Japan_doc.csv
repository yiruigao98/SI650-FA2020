Kurayoshi (倉吉市, Kurayoshi-shi) is a city located in the central part of Tottori Prefecture, Japan.
As of October 1, 2016, the city has an estimated population of 48,558 and a population density of 180 persons per km², making it the third largest city in Tottori.  The total area is 272.15 km².
The ancient provincial government of Hoki province was located in this area, and in medieval times Uchikoshiyama (a hill) featured a castle. Today the remnants of the provincial government and two monasteries can still be seen in the city. Kurayoshi was officially founded on October 1, 1953 though historical Kurayoshi predates this foundation and the grid outline of the streets reflects a certain amount of Edo Period planning. Additionally there are many 'soil lacquered' warehouses (dozo, 土蔵) that survive, 'soil lacquering' being a traditional Japanese style of architecture.
On March 22, 2005 the town of Sekigane (from Tōhaku District) was merged into Kurayoshi.
