== History ==


=== Early history ===
The area of present-day Kamogawa was part of ancient Awa Province. Nichiren (1222 – 1282) was born in the Kominato district of Kamogawa, and his birthplace is commemorated at Tanjō-ji. During the Edo period, it was mostly tenryō territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, with portions under the control of the feudal domains of Funagata Domain, Tateyama Domain, Iwasuki Domain and Tsurumaki Domain. The short-lived (1638-1690) Tōjō Domain and the Bakumatsu period Hanabusa Domain were also located within the borders of modern Kamogawa.


=== Modern history ===
In 1877, ten years after the beginning of the Meiji era, Kamogawa suffered a notable cholera outbreak. In 1927 Awa-Kamogawa Station became the terminus of both the Sotobō Line and the Uchibō Line. The city sustained injuries and fatalities during World War II via aerial bombing by the United States. The city was occupied by American forces after the war. Soon after, land reform and economic reform were carried out in Kamogawa. In 1958 the coastal areas of Kamogawa became a part of Minami Bōsō Quasi-National Park, and the town became a tourist destination as a result of the establishment of the park.


== Economy ==
Kamogawa serves as a commercial center for the surrounding region of south-central Chiba Prefecture. Commercial fishing remains the primary industry in Kamogawa, which has five active fishing ports. The city is noted for its sardine and mackerel production. Rice farming and floriculture are practiced. The tourist industry is a growing component of the local economy, with visitors attracted to the area's beaches, hot spring resorts, Kamogawa Seaworld, and the Futomi Flower Center.


== Administrative history ==
At the start of the Meiji period, Kamogawa consisted of all of Nagasa District with two towns and nine villages, and two villages from neighboring Asai District. All of these villages and towns (including Kamogawa Town) became part of Awa District in 1890. Kamogawa was elevated to city status on March 31, 1971.
On February 11, 2005, the town of Amatsukominato (from Awa District) was merged into Kamogawa.
