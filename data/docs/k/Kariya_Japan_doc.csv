== History ==
Kariya was a castle town in the Sengoku period, in an area contested between the Imagawa clan, Oda clan and various local warlords, including the Mizuno clan and Matsudaira clan. Tokugawa Ieyasu’s maternal grandfather Mizuno Tadamasa rebuilt Kariya Castle in the mid-16th century.  The Mizuno clan shifted allegiances adroitly between the Imagawa clan to Oda Nobunaga and to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who relocated the clan to Ise Province. However, Mizuno Katsunari, the grandson of Tadamasa was allowed to return to the clan's ancestral territories by Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara as daimyō of Kariya Domain, a feudal han under the Tokugawa shogunate. The domain was reassigned to numerous clans during the Edo period, but was retained by the Doi clan from 1734 until the Meiji Restoration.
After the Meiji Restoration, Kariya Town was created within Hekikai District, Aichi Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889. The town prospered as a center for commerce, sake production, sericulture and ceramics due to its location on the main railway routes. The Yosami Transmitting Station, located in Kariya, was Japan's tallest structure when completed in 1929. Kariya achieved city status on April 1, 1950. The city expanded by annexation of neighboring Fujimatsu and most of Yosami villages on April 1, 1955. Control of the Yosami Transmitting Station was returned to Japan from the United States Navy in 1994, and the former facility is now a city park.
