Klaeng District (Thai: แกลง, pronounced [klɛ̄ːŋ]) is a district (amphoe) on the coast of Rayong Province, eastern Thailand.


== History ==
Klaeng's history dates back to  the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Due to its location mid-way between Mueang Rayong District and Chanthaburi Province and due to its abundance of natural resources such as fertile rice fields and many watercourses, it has been a magnet for immigration.Since the Ayutthaya period, Klaeng has been a place to gather people for war service.In the reign of King Rama V, Mueang Klaeng was a fourth class city under Monthon Chanthaburi. The former city offices were in Ban Laem Mueang, Tambon Paknam Prasae. In 1897 the office was moved to Ban Pho Thong, on the north side of Wat Pho Thong. In 1908 Mueang Klaeng was downgraded to a district of Rayong Province.


== Geography ==
Neighboring districts are (from the west clockwise): Mueang Rayong, Wang Chan, and Khao Chamao of Rayong Province; Kaeng Hang Maeo and Na Yai Am of Chanthaburi Province. To the south is the Gulf of Thailand.
Klaeng's main watercourse is the Prasae River. Its name is assumed to be from Chong Sae (แซรฺ), which means 'rice field'.


== Administration ==
The district is divided into 15 sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 146 villages (mubans). Klaeng is a town (thesaban mueang) which covers parts of tambons Thang Kwian and Wang Wa.
