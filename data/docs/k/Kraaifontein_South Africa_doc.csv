Kraaifontein is a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa and a northern suburb of Cape Town. The name originated from large number of crows (Kraai in Afrikaans) that nest in the region.

In 1869 sub-division of farm land started in the area. In 1876 a railway station was formed called "Kraaifontein Junction". In 1877 formal town development started. The first school was established on 20 January 1908. The Dutch reformed church was founded in 1948. In the same year Kraaifontein got its own local authority. In 1954 the "Volkskerk van Afrika (Translated- The nation's church of Africa)" was founded with Appollis,BJE, being the first preacher. On 16 September 1957, it became a municipality under the first Mayor JP Rossouw.

== Areas ==
Kraaifontein, encompassing the areas of Northpine, Scottsdene,Scottsville, Wallacedene, Eikendal and Bloekombos, was once a separate municipality before the restructuring of all South African municipalities during the late 90s. These areas, however, are listed as separate suburbs by the City of Cape Town for planning and statistical purposes. Forming part of the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality, it is located in its Subcouncil 2 Area, Bergdal.


== Coat of arms ==
The Kraaifontein municipal council assumed a coat of arms, registered it with the Cape Provincial Administration in June 1964, had it granted by the provincial administrator in March 1967, and registered it at the Bureau of Heraldry in September 1969.
The arms, designed by Schalk Pienaar, were: Argent,  a  chevron Gules between in chief two heraldic fountains and  in  base  a  bunch  of  grapes leaved proper (in layman's terms: a silver shield displaying, from top to bottom, two discs divided into wavy white and blue stripes, a red chevron, and a bunch of grapes).  The crest was a parson-crow, and the motto Non auro sed virtute.  Together the crow (kraai) and the fountains (fonteine) were a pun on the name of the town.
