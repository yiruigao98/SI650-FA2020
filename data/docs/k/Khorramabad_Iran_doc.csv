== Etymology ==
"KhorMoah" is the way local call it. "KhorMoa" in Lori and Laki, local languages, means the place that you can see the sunset.
"KhorMoah" has been translated as "Khorram Abad" in Farsi which means the green and beautiful place.
Modern Persian -âbâd, meaning "settlement" or "abode", derives from Middle Persian āpāt ("populous"). However, according to linguist Sasha Lubotsky, the Persian term ābād might derive from Proto-Iranian *āpāta ("protected"), rooting from Proto-Indo-European *peh₂- ("to protect"). Thus, it can mean "protected settlement".

=== Pre-Islamic era ===


=== Simash ===
During the late third millennium B.C. and early second millennium B.C., when Simashki sovereigns was ruling on Elam, for the first time a fort was built on the peak of a natural cliff to protect the city against its enemies. Sixty hundred years later, Ellipi kings built a new fort on the ruins of the old one. Simash was the name of the place. It was the capital of Simashki dynasty.


==== Shapurkhast ====
In the texts of historians Shapurkhast has been considered one of the most important and developed cities of the region during this period. Falak-ol-Aflak castle ( Dež-e Shāpūr-Khwāst) was built by Shapur I the Sasanid.


=== Islamic era ===
Probably in the late seventh century CE, Shapurkhast was destroyed and the people of Shapurkhast moved to the western part of Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, which offered plenty of water as well as safety.
Hamdallah Mustawfi writes: Khorramabad was a beautiful city, now it is destroyed.


==== Hazaraspids ====
The founder of the Hazaraspid dynasty was Abu Tahir ibn Muhammad, a descendant of the Shabankara chieftain Fadluya.

He assumed the prestigious title of atabeg.

==== Qajar dynasty ====
In this period, the city of Khorramabad was limited to environs of Falak-ol-Aflak Castle. This period was the beginning of a migration of people from small villages into Khorramabad. The increase in population led to the expansion of the city and the creation of new districts.
