Kladno (Czech pronunciation: [ˈkladno]; German: Kladen) is a city in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It is located 25 kilometres (16 miles) northwest of the capital city Prague. Kladno is the largest city in the region and has a population together with its adjacent suburban areas of more than 110,000 (nearly 70,000 in Kladno proper). The city is a part of the Prague metropolitan area.


== History ==

The first written evidence of Kladno dates back to the 14th century. In 1561 the city rights were secured.
Until 1918, the city was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austrian side after the compromise of 1867), head of the Kladno district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. A post-office was opened in 1863.


== Economy ==
Kladno was the historical birthplace of heavy industry in Bohemia. For years, the city was home to the Poldi steel factory, the region's largest employer. The factory still stands but has been divided into smaller entities after privatisation and changes in ownership. The mining industry began here in 1842. The proximity to Prague helped to keep the local economy stable in spite of the heavy industrial decline after the collapse of the communist regime.
A series of Western European companies has established production in Kladno, including Lego, Dr. Oetker, NKT Cables and Quickstep Laminate Floors.
