== History ==
Kotturu is named after Saint Kottureshwara, so its history stems from the history of Guru Kottureshwara. Legend has it that, when the Lingayath Dharma was leaning towards Vedic Sanathana style, to refine and to create awareness about Basavadi pranitha sharana Dharma to people and to make them understand about shatsthala, Ashtavarana Lord Kottureswara spent his lifetime here. That is why devotees call him as Astavarana Tatvopadeshi Guru. It is believed that he placed in his heart all the people and solved everyone's problems.
The Virasaiva religion was brought into practice by Lord Basavanna in the 12th century and lord Kottureswara was the continuity of same sharana parampare established by Basavanna and sharanas. Kottu or Kodu in Kannada means give and Eshwar means God (Kotu + Eshwara= Kottureshwara). No one knows about the birth and childhood of Kottureswara, but he reached shikhapura at a young age. He travelled from North Kashmir to Kanyakumari. During the ruling of Akbar in Delhi, Lord Kottureswar appeared in the bedroom of Akbar's wife as an Old saint and blessed her. Hearing the voice of the old man, the guard informed this to the emperor. Akbar in anger came in to the queen's bedroom and saw the mid aged person sleeping in the queen's bed. For the Queen Kottureshwara appeared as a saint and for Akbar he appeared as an ordinary man. In his fury, he attacked  Kottureshwar with sword but to his astonishment the sword became a flower Garland. By this  Akbar realized his mistake and surrendered to the Lord. Lord Kottureshwar blessed Akbar and the Rajput queen. Akbar presented Lord Kottureshwar with his Sword and the Cot on which lord Kottureshwara was sleeping. This Cot is located at Gachchina Mutt of Kotturu even now. He also offered him Sarsipura or Shikapura an independent territory which was under his ruling.Lord Kottureswara's temples are divided into 4 shrines in Kottur 

Murkalmutt (3 stone shrine)
Thotalmutt (shrine with cradle)
Darbarmutt or Doddamutt (king assembly shrine or big shrine)
Gachina mutt (shrine where saint returns kailsa by meditating)In first mutt is the one where the Lord appeared first in the land of Kotturu.
Second mutt is where the lord blessed a child. Third Is the mutt where he used give sadare (preaching on religion) and  solve the problems of the people. The fourth is the mutt where Guru Kottureswara entered Ikya Stala the final stage of Shudstala (Yoga Samadhi).
There is another story related to the Gachhina mutt. Earlier this used to be a temple of Lord Veerabhadra. Once people started visiting Lord Kottureswara to get the blessings, and begin to lessen the worship of lord Veerabhadra. Lord Veerabhadra complained about this to Lord Kottureshwara. Then the guru asked him to occupy another place called Kodathgudda where Lord Veerabhadra's temple is situated now. This is also an equally famous temple in this region.
Lord Kottureshwara visited a village near Mysuru and noticed the devotion of a priest in the  temple (named Karilingeswara). He requested him to come with him and be his disciple and henceforth the priest of the temple in Kotturu. There is also a saying that he ordered only the children from his family should to be  the priests for the forthcoming generations. Hence to take care of the priest's family a land was given in the nearby village called K. Ayyanahalli. There is a temple dedicated to Karilingeswara in this village. Some of the descendants of his family continue to do the worship at the Hiremath and stay in this village.
In memory of Lord Kottureshwara, devotees name their sons as Kotresh and daughters as Kotturamma. These names are commonly found in and around Kotturu.
There is an annual fair which happens just before MahaShivaratri. Devotees from all over assemble to witness the fair and the car festival. Some of the devotees even reach Kottur by walk from their native place. During the month of December there will be Karthikotsava.
There is a temple of Kotturamma (Parvathi) on the outskirts of Kottur. Kotturamma is neither the wife or related to Lord Kottureshwara but a form of Goddess Parvathi. The Karnam family of Kottur maintains the temple. There is a festival in every August where in which lakhs of people attend the festival. The place is famed by a veteran theater person Kotturappa, a legendary actor, whose performance in the role of Danashoora Karna is widely known throughout Karnataka.
