Venezuelan Americans (Spanish: venezolano-americanos or estadounidenses de origen venezolano) are Americans who trace their heritage, or part of their heritage, to the nation of Venezuela. The word may refer to someone born in the US of Venezuelan descent or to someone who has emigrated to the US from Venezuela.
Venezuelan Americans are one of 20 Latin American groups in the United States. While other US citizens or residents with national origins in any of the Hispanic American countries may be closely related to Spaniards in language and culture, Venezuelan Americans reflect their diversified culture. This includes influences from Spanish, Portuguese, Italians, Germans, and the French, along with influences from African and indigenous Amerindian elements.
Venezuelan Spanish is the group's spoken form of the Spanish language.
In the United States, Venezuelans are on top of the list of nationalities requesting asylum. 


== History ==
Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States. During the eighteenth and nineteenth century, there were many European migrants who went originally to Venezuela, but later moved to the United States with their children and grandchildren who were born and/or grew up in Venezuela speaking Spanish. From 1910 to 1930, it is estimated that over 4,000 South Americans each year migrated to the United States. However, there are not many specific figures that indicate the number of Venezuelans among the 4,000.Many Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a better education, only to remain there following graduation. They are frequently joined by relatives. However, since the 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary and due to the economic fluctuations in Venezuela which also promoted an important migration of Venezuelan professionals to the US. In recent years, many Venezuelans opposing the regime of the president Nicolás Maduro are migrating to the US (mostly to Florida, but New York City and Houston are other destinations).


== Demographics ==
The largest concentration of Venezuelans in the United States is in South Florida, especially the suburbs of Doral and Weston. Other main states with Venezuelan American populations are, according to the 2010 census, Texas, New York, California, New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia. Urban areas with a large Venezuelan community include Miami, Houston, New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.

=== Ethnic variety ===
The Venezuelan American population represents Venezuela's ethnic variety. Some 70 percent of Venezuelan immigrants are a mixture of European, Amerindian, and African ancestry. The rest are 21 percent white, 8 percent black and 1 percent is Amerindian. Most Venezuelan Americans are descendants of Spanish (mainly), Africans, Italians, Portuguese, Germans, French, and Chinese.


== Socioeconomics ==
The Venezuelan American population are highly educated. The people obtain a bachelor's, graduate, and professional degrees at nearly double (48.5%) the total U.S. national percentage (27%), while only 6% of the group's adults did not complete high school, compared to 15.9% of the total U.S. national population.
Venezuelan Americans are not only highly adapted to the English language and achieve great accomplishments in American education, but also tend to consider the teaching and preservation of the Spanish language a priority for the most part. Thus, they teach the language to their children.  And emphasize an extreme importance to obtaining a level of academic achievement and/or technical acumen to their own children.
Venezuelan Americans work in a variety of professions. However, most of them are inclined to banking and the petroleum industry. Thus, they often have a significantly deep depth of expertise within these specific professions. Venezuelan Americans also work in highlighted positions of  television, publishing, and radio industries. In addition, many Venezuelan Americans are becoming politicians or entering some form of public service within government, working both local politics and federal politics. Furthermore there is a significant growth in the number of Venezuelan Americans that engage in the public arena of politics specific at the Federal level, going so far as proactively submitting for electoral consideration for those federal public positions.  In general, most common Venezuelan Americans citizens will often engage heavily and overtly in US politics, and the politics of their native country, and are often extremely well informed and a few among their number are astute near-consistent life-long polymath students of history, language, science, culture, and economics.  
They will often be very aware of specific political policies, local, state, and federal laws, and the history of where those policies and laws come from.  The attitude among these few Venezuelan Americans is that there is no shame of not knowing something, but to be content and complicit in not knowing is something to be truly be ashamed of.  So they will often instead view the lack or absence of knowing something as an opportunity to proactively engage a deep self study on a particular subject to be better suited and far capable to speak to that subject the next time they engage in a discussion on that same subject.


== Relations with Venezuela ==

Venezuelan Americans still maintain strong relations with their country of origin, which can easily be seen in business, family, and community life. Venezuelan Americans often report on the social and current events in Venezuela and first-generation immigrants visit there frequently. It is also quite common for Venezuelans to visit their relatives in the United States.
