== History ==

Kiratpur Sahib was founded by the sixth Guru Sri Hargobind Sahib. Here the seventh and eighth Gurus were born and brought up. It was here that Guru Gobind Singh along with his followers received the sacred head of the ninth Guru Sri Tegh Bahadur, brought from Delhi with great devotion and respect by Bhai Jaita in 1675. The particular spot associated with and sanctified by it, is known as Gurudwara Babangarh Sahib. The tenth Guru took the sacred head of his father in a procession to Anandpur Sahib for cremation. The Punjab Government has constructed a pillar here, on which is inscribed the following quotation from Guru Gobind Singh describing the unique martyrdom of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadurji, "The Lord (Guru Tegh Bahadur) protected their paste mark (Tilak) - and the sacred thread. A great deed he enacted in the age of kala (darkness)".
The area is also associated with the memory of a Muslim saint, Pir Buddan Shah who was gifted with a very long life (local legends say about 800 years).
The Gurdwara is situated on the bank of the river Sutlej about 10 km south of Anandpur and about 30 km north of Rupnagar. It is on the Nangal-Rupnagar-Chandigarh road (NH21).
The city and its many Gurdwaras are sacred places for the Sikhs as several of the Sikh Gurus visited, were born and lived here. The ashes of several Gurus were immersed in the nearby Sutlej River.
Even today many Sikhs come here to spread the ashes of their loved ones in the River.
