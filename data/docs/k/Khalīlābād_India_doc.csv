== River system and water resources ==
The Ami, the chief tributary of the Rapti, is a stream which commences at a short distance from Rapti in Rasulpur and issues from a large tract of paddy land.
The lakes of the district are numerous and several are of considerable size. They are most commonly formed by the changes in the river channels, while in other cases the natural depressions in which the surface of water collects, are generally due in some measure to fluvial action. The largest and the most celebrated lake in the district is the Bakhira or Badhanchh Tal, sometimes called the Moti Jhil, which lies on the eastern borders of the district between Bakhira and Mehdawal. This lake, though seldom more than two meters in depth, covers a very large area of about 12 km. long and 4 km. broad. The water in the lake is largely derived from the overflow from Rapti.
Ghaghra popular as Saryu river, Kuano river and Kathinaiya river are also situated in the district.
