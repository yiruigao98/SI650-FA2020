Kyzyl (Tuvan and Russian: Кызыл, romanized: Kızıl) is the capital city of the Tuva Republic, Russia. The name of the city means  "red" or "crimson" in Tuvan (as well as in many other Turkic languages). Population: 109,918 (2010 Census); 104,105 (2002 Census); 84,641 (1989 Census).It was previously known as Belotsarsk (until 1918), Khem-Beldyr (until 1926).


== History ==
It was founded in 1914 as Belotsarsk (Белоца́рск, lit. White Tsar's town). In 1918, it was renamed Khem-Beldir (Хем-Белдир), and in 1926 it was given its present name. When the city was the capital of Tannu Tuva, it was named Kizil Khoto. In September 2014, Kyzyl celebrated its 100th anniversary as a city.


== Geography ==

Kyzyl claims to be located exactly in the geographical center of Asia. Whether these coordinates are in fact the center of Asia is disputed (e.g., Ürümqi in China makes a similar claim). However, there is a monument labelled "Center of Asia" in English, Russian, and Tuvan which asserts this claim. Tos-Bulak is the area of open fields and mineral springs which lies immediately south of Kyzyl.
Kyzyl stands at the point where the Yenisei River meets the Maly Yenisey River to form the Verkhny Yenisey (Улуг-Хем). Most development takes place south of the river and follows the curves of the river, with the highest development centered where the two headstreams of the Yenisei, the Bii-Khem (Russian: Большой Енисей), and the Kaa-Khem (Russian: Малый Енисей, romanized: Maly Yenisei), meet. A monument was built in 1964 on the river bank to mark this.


== Administrative and municipal status ==
Kyzyl is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city under republic jurisdiction (urban okrug) of Kyzyl—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts (kozhuuns). As a municipal division, the city under republic jurisdiction (urban okrug) of Kyzyl is incorporated as Kyzyl Urban Okrug.

== Climate ==
The climate of Kyzyl is an extreme continental semi-arid variety (Köppen climate classification BSk), with average highs around 25 °C or 77 °F in the summer and −20 °C or −4 °F in the winter and only 218 millimetres or 8.58 inches of precipitation annually. Located far from any moderating bodies of water and at a relatively high latitude, temperatures can be extreme, though less so than the Sakha Republic. Nevertheless, the temperature has never risen above freezing from 22 November to 3 March, inclusive. Temperature swings can be rapid. The transitional seasons of spring and autumn are short: only April and October average close to the annual mean of −1.2 °C (29.8 °F).


== In popular culture ==
In the late 1980s, Kyzyl was visited by Ralph Leighton, who had made it a quest to reach Tuva with his friend, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. Though Feynman died before they reached Tuva, the journey is chronicled in the book Tuva or Bust!
The film Genghis Blues chronicles the pilgrimage of a blind blues performer, Paul Pena, who learned Tuvan throat singing by listening to his shortwave radio, to compete in the Tuvan throat singing competition.
Kyzyl is featured as a cultural city-state in the strategy game Civilization V.
