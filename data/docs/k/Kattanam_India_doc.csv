== History ==
Kattanam was merged with Mankavu (Kavu with mango trees) and there was only a very few Hindu families were living in this place including Mankavil Gurunathanmaar those who were conducting mantravadham (Black Magic) and believed to had supernatural powers.  The story of Kattanam is related to a Yakshi (Brahma Rakshas) lived in Mankavu was a folkloric vampire . She was a Brahmin lady who was living in the same place centuries before the mankavu was formed. She had found murdered in her tharavattu kulam (family pond) together with her unborn child. And it is also believed that the entire Brahmin family who were living there destroyed and centuries after Mankavu formed in the same place.  The Brahmin lady was reborn into a Yakshi, waylaying men with her beauty and drinking their blood. It is also believed that after stopping the yakshi of Panayannarkavu, kadamattathu Kathanar (a priest with supernatural power) has visited Kattanam to stop the yakshi but he couldn’t succeed and returned. Even the karmas (actions) of Mankavil Gurunadhanmar’s were turned against them, their powers couldn’t withstand against yakshi and the unnatural death of their family members increased day by day. It has been found in devaprashnam (ascertaining the lord's will) that the land has to be sold (for prize) to someone to get rid of the yakshi as well as the curse on them.  Kattanam was very fertile land but were not in use due to the fear of the yakshi in Mankavu. Finally a Scholar Velangattu Achen aka Mankavil Valiachen (Parish priest of Kattanam Orthodox Valiapally) has come forward and purchased the entire Mankavu for one Rasi (ancient Indian coin). This Mankavil achen arrested the yakshi with his Divine power and the yakshi requested him to install her to a paala tree (Alstonia Scholaris) which he refused and her soul sent permanently to rest in peace. From then the Velangattu achan known famous as Mankavilachan, destroyed the entire Mankavu and removed the fear from the public, made the place suitable for Katta (paddy with grains) production by Anam (blessing) from God. Because of the good fertility of the paddy land, the production of KATTA’s (paddy with grains) has increased, accumulated and traded from here, “KATTA-ANAM” means “Blessed with Paddy Grains” and since the place is known and called as KATTANAM.

The church was blessed by Cheppad Philipose Mar Dionysius, (Malankara Metropolitan of The Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church during 1825–1855) in the name of the first Martyr St. Stephen.
