It is the second largest settlement in the country after Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei, and functions as the capital for the district.

The postcode for Kuala Belait subdivision is KA1131.Kuala Belait literally means "the mouth of the Belait River" in the Malay language. Its name comes from kuala meaning either confluence of two rivers or the mouth of a river, and Belait, the name of the river and district.  It is also known locally as "Belait".  When needed to distinguish it from the district of the same name, it is known locally as "KB town" in English or "Pekan Belait" in Malay.


== Location ==

Kuala Belait is located close to the western border of Brunei with the State of Sarawak at 114.18ºE longitude and 4.59ºN latitude.  The town center is bounded by the South China Sea to the north, the Belait River to the west and south and the suburbs of Kampong Sungai Pandan and Kampong Mumong to the east and south-east respectively.
The historic administrative capital of the Belait district, Kuala Balai is located to the south and is linked to Kuala Belait by both road and river, and the oil town of Seria is located about 10 miles (16 km) east.  Bandar Seri Begawan is about 120 km to the north-east.  The Sarawakian city of Miri is located about 40 km the south-west.


== History ==
Kuala Belait was a small fishing village at the turn of the 20th century.  The natives were Belait Malays who were mainly fishermen.  According to local customs, there was a falling out between two groups of the inhabitants and one of those groups moved to the west bank of the mouth of the Belait River to found the current day Kampong Sungai Teraban.
The old historic administrative capital of the Belait district used to be Kuala Balai, further up the Belait River.  However, when oil was discovered in Padang Berawa (modern day Seria), a new administrative center for the district was established at the mouth of the Belait River so as to be more accessible.  Kuala Balai, then was too inaccessible as there were no roads linking it to the rest of the country.
The Kuala Belait Sanitary Board was established near the turn of the 1930s, and this marked the transition of Kuala Belait from a village to a town.  The Kuala Belait Sanitary Board was the forerunner of the Kuala Belait/Seria Municipal Board, or Lembaga Bandaran Kuala Belait dan Seria in Malay.  In Brunei towns are governed by a Municipal Board while each village is governed by a village council.
The town was captured by the Japanese during the Second World War but was restored to Brunei after the war.
Under the rule of His Majesty the late Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin, the town blossomed as commercial buildings such as the current shophouses along Jalan Pretty.
After independence from Britain in 1984, a number of new government buildings were constructed to house the local services of the Brunei government.
At the turn of the millennium, a number of hotels were built in the center of town which drastically changed the skyline.
