Koynanagar is a town in Maharashtra, India. It is situated on the Chiplun-Sangli state highway on the banks of Koyna River. The town is small but famous for Koyna Dam and the Koyna Hydroelectric Project which is the largest completed hydroelectric project of India. An earthquake in 1967 flattened the city.
Koyna Nagar is nestled in the Western Ghats, about 746 m (2,448 ft) above sea level, and hence has a tolerable climate for most of the year.
The Nehru Gardens, the Botanical Gardens and Kumbarli Ghat viewpoint are the most popular tourist destinations in the vicinity. Hordes of picnickers, mostly from Pune, come to the area during the monsoon season, to visit waterfalls and see the rolling green hills with misty tops and foggy valleys in the Kumbarli Ghat, which is a mountain pass.
The Nehru Gardens, a landscaped garden which overlooks the Koyna Dam, is two kilometres away from the town. The Botanical Gardens is five kilometres from Nehru Park. It contains rare species of plants, some of which are used for their medicinal properties and in research. All the plants are native to the Western Ghats.
