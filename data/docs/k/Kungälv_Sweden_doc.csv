Kungälv Municipality (Kungälvs kommun) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Kungälv.
The present municipality was formed in 1971 through the amalgamation of the City of Kungälv, the City of Marstrand and territories belonging to four rural municipalities. In 1974 a minor part (situated on the island of Hisingen) was transferred to Gothenburg Municipality.
Geographically it borders to Gothenburg Municipality (south), Ale Municipality (east), Lilla Edet Municipality (north-east) and Stenungsund Municipality (north). To the east flows the river Göta älv and to the south, marking the border to Gothenburg, flows the river Nordre älv. On an island in the river, the medieval Bohus Fortress faces the city of Kungälv.

Kareby IS, which play their home matches at Skarpe Nord in Kungälv, are the reigning bandy champions for women as of 2016. They also won the title in 2011 and 2015.
