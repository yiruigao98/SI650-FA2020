The town was established by Benedictines from Postoloprty in the 12th century. They built a monastery there, which was destroyed in the 13th century. The village kept the name of Klösterle, i.e. little Kloster in German, and klášter in Czech.
In 1794, the oldest Czech porcelain factory was founded in the Miřetice village, since associated into Klášterec nad Ohří. In the years to come the town grew in importance as one of the earliest European regions of porcelain production and became famous for its porcelain. There is still porcelain production even today under the trade name THUN 1974 a.s. as part of the EPIAG association of various Altrohlau porcelain companies. However, the owners of the original Klášterec nad Ohří porcelain factory, the Princes of Thun und Hohenstein were in 1945 expelled from Czechoslovakia along with the remaining ethnic German population.


=== Rašovice ===
Rašovice is a small village on the way to Kadaň on the right bank of the river. It was called Rošovice (after the name of Roch) until 1924. Having been separate until 1961, the village is now a part of Klášterec nad Ohří. There are ruins of Egerberk castle above the village.
The village was first recorded in 1443 as a part of the Egerberg domain and with the domain changed holders from Fictums to Lobkowitz of Hasištejn. Bohuslav Felix of Lobkowitz built a castle in the village in 1581 and called it Felixburg. With a new master – Christoph Simon von Thun, 1623, after the Battle of White Mountain – the village became part of the Thun's domain. St. Anne Church was finished 1837 to replace the previous chapel. In 1871 the villagers rose against the construction of a new bridge over the river, and after a skirmish with the Italian workers they had to be pacified by the army.
The population was 296 in 1863, 587 in 1930 and 104 in 1991.
