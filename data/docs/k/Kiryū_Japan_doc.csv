== History ==
Kiryū is located within traditional Kōzuke Province and has been noted since the Nara period for production of fabrics. The place name appears in the Kamakura period Azuma Kagami. During the Edo period, most of the area of present-day Kiryū was part of the tenryō holding under the direct administration of the Tokugawa shogunate, with the exception of the commercial center and temple town of Kiryū-shinmachi, noted for sericulture since the Nara period, which was part of Shōnai Domain of Dewa Province. The area also prospered from its location on the Kiryū and Watarase rivers.

Kiryū Town was created within Yamada District, Gunma Prefecture on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration. It was raised to city status on March 1, 1921. Kiryū annexed the neighboring village of Sakaino on April 1, 1933 and village of Hirosawa on April 1, 1937. The city expanded further with the annexation of Umeda, Aioi and part of Kawauchi village on October 1, 1954.
On June 13, 2005, Kiryū absorbed the villages of Niisato and Kurohone (both from Seta District).

In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Gunma 1st district and the Gunma 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.


== Economy ==
Traditionally, Kiryū's principal industry was sericulture and silk textile manufacturing, with records dating silk production as far back as 713 AD.  Pachinko manufacturing arrived in Kiryū after World War II, during the period of industrial reconstruction, with the formation of two main companies—the Heiwa Corporation in 1949, and the Sophia Corporation in 1951. Kiryū's factories are responsible for manufacturing 60% of Japan's pachinko machines.  However, the decreased demand for silk goods and the closure of several area manufacturing concerns have caused the local economy to suffer.
Mitsuba Corporation, a major manufacturer of automotive parts is headquartered in the city.

Kiryū has 17 public elementary schools and ten public middle schools operated by the city government, and six public high schools operated by the Gunma Prefectural Board of Education. There are also two private middle schools and two private high schools.
