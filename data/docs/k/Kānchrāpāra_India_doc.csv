Kanchrapara is a city and a municipality of North 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA).


== History ==
From early historical period, geographically, this area had been full of swamps, natural riverine lake, low land, water bodies sparse village-settlements surrounded by deep jungle infested with wild animals of all kinds. Barring a few pockets, the area was considered unfit for human habitation.
However, around this area, there were several dozen villages more or less prosperous, such as Mallickbaag, Kanchanpalli or Kanchrapara, Bhawanipur, Ghoshpara, Chandua and Kampa. This area underwent development from 1862- the Sealdaha Kusthia Broad Gauge Railway Line, through 1863- construction of a 132000 m² locomotive workshop and railway station on the northernmost tip of Bizpur Mouza, undertaken by Eastern Bengal State Railway. In 1914 a carriage and wagon shop were added. Subsequently, a planned Railway Township was laid and built to the East & South West of the Workshops with a wide range of infrastructure - roads, drains, bridges, street lights, internal Railway lines, parks, Institutes, Administrative Buildings, Technical School, Hospital, Co-operative shopping stores, Bazaar, playgrounds for football, Tennis, golf, theatre attached to each institute (Hindmarsh Institute, Bell Institute, Spalding Institute), Officers’ Club etc. The resulting population increase caused the construction of huts and pucca buildings, necessitating the expansion of Municipal infrastructure beyond the Railway area.
This city was named Kanchrapara since the Railway Station at Bijpur was named after the then village Kanchanpalli or Kanchrapara. It was prosperous economically and culturally, being the seat of many stalwarts of Baishnab literature and early Bengali literature, as well as famous Vaidyas.One of the most old primary school was established by Brajendranath Sil at Bagmore approximately at the time of 1960-1966. The descendants are also living in that same city . now the present family members of Sri Brajendranath Sil are involved in various kind of social works by making a committee (Sangathan) called Bijnan darbar . Charubala Sil, the wife Sri Brajendranath Sil used to feed many distressed, miserable, needy persons everyday without looking at the family economic status. One can say that Brajendranath Sil was the person who ignited the city Bagmore by his up to date and prudent thinking and by his abysmal thesaurus .
