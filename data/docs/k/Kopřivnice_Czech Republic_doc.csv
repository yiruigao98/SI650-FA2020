Until 1918, Nesselsdorf – Kopřivnice  was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the Nový Jičín – Neutitschein District, one of the 34 administrative districts (Bezirkshauptmannschaften) in Moravia.A post-office was opened in 1870, named Nesselsdorf.

Between the years 1939–1945, both villages were attached to the Third Reich within so called “the Nový Jičín Landrat”. In 1945 the German population was expelled according to the Beneš Decrees.
