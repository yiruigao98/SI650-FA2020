== History ==

The original settlement in the area was called Dobytown, located 2 miles (3.2 km) southeast of the present-day Kearney. Later the city was moved and renamed after the nearby Fort Kearny (with an extra "e" added, but pronounced the same), a United States Army outpost along the Oregon Trail in the middle of the 19th century. The fort was named after Colonel (later General) Stephen W. Kearny.   The "e" was added by mistake sometime afterwards by postmen who consistently misspelled the town name; eventually it just stuck. The current location of the city is on the north side of the Platte River and steadily grew as a result of the influence of the railroad.
In 1912, a Catholic Diocese was centered here. This status was removed in 1917, with the creation of other dioceses. In 1997, the city began to be used as a titular see by the Catholic Church.
