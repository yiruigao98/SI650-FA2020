Kamo is a popular place for small tour groups, especially for children in elementary school.  It is advertised as a "traditional town" and sometimes referred to as the Little Kyoto of the Hokuetsu region.  This is because it shares certain structural features with Kyoto, being surrounded on three sides by mountains and intersected by a river.  Kamo's most famous attraction is Kamoyama Park, which is home to the Omi Jinja (Shrine) and many other sights, including a petting area for small squirrels which the town has regularly imported.  The Kamo River is also the site of many city events, including the Obon Festival in August and the Snow Camelia Festival in April.  The snow camelia is a symbol of Kamo and can be seen growing in many locations around the city.
