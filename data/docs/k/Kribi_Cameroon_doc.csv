Kribi is a beach resort and sea port in Cameroon.


== Location ==
The coastal town of Kribi lies on the Gulf of Guinea, in Océan Department, South Province,  at the mouth of the Kienké River. This location, lies approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi), by road, south of Douala, the largest city in Cameroon and the busiest seaport in the country. The coordinates of Kribi are: 2° 56' 6.00"N, 9° 54' 36.00"E (Latitude: 2.9350; Longitude: 9.9100)


== Overview ==

It has an estimated population of 55,401. It services sea traffic in the Gulf of Guinea and also lies near the terminus of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. The Lobé Waterfalls are nearby and there is a road inland, through the Littoral Evergreen Forest, as far as Bipindi and Lolodorf where native communities of Pygmies are found.


== Kribi Power Station ==
Kribi Power Development Company (KPDC) has built a natural gas-powered electricity generating plant, Kribi Power Station, in the community of Mpolongwe, approximately 10 kilometres (6.2 mi), north of the Kribi central business district. The 216 MW plant that cost US$390 million (CFA:176.3 billion) to build, came on line in 2013. It is now owned by Globeleq A second phase expansion is planned.


== Port ==
The vicinity of Kribi is a possible location of a port for the export of iron ore from about 500 kilometres (310 mi) away. Specifically, the port could be at Grand Batanga about halfway between Kribi and the border with Equatorial Guinea, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi), by road, to the south of Kribi. Since there is no natural harbour at Kribi, the port itself would be several kilometres offshore where deepwater of at least 20 metres (66 ft) is suitable for large Capesize ships. It is also the location for the Kribi Lighthouse.

Update 2017. The port  development has proceeded at Kribi See.Update 2020. The port is being developed by Louis Berger


== Iron mine ==
The iron ore will come from mines near Mbalam.  The mine would have an output of approximately 35 million tonnes per year, with a 30-year or so lifespan. An alternate site for this port is at Lolabé.


== Bauxite mine ==
The port of Kribi is proposed to serve new Bauxite mine in the north of Cameroon.
