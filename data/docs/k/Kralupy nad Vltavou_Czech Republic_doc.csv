Kralupy nad Vltavou (Czech pronunciation: [ˈkralupɪ ˈnad vl̩tavou]; German: Kralup an der Moldau) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 18,000 inhabitants. The town lies on the Vltava River some 25 km (16 mi) north of Prague. The town is a part of the Prague metropolitan area.


== Administrative parts ==
It consists of the following neighbourhoods: Kralupy, Lobeč, Lobeček, Minice, Mikovice, Zeměchy. These neighbourhoods were separate villages before the creation of the town at the beginning of the 20th century.


== History ==
The area of the actual town has been inhabited for millennia, but a significant growth of its population did not begin until the 19th century. It was the construction of the railway that stimulated a strong population growth. Factories were built near the railway, and the Oil Campaign of World War II targeted the oil refinery on December 28, 1944. During the totalitarian communist rule (1948–89) the town lacked democratic municipal government. 
The town centre was damaged by flood in 2002.


== Transport ==

Three bridges across the Vltava River are in the town – T. G. Masaryk Bridge (a highway bridge built in 1920s), a footbridge with bicycle lane (built in 1990s) and a railway bridge. The town is also an important railway hub. The main line from Prague to Dresden runs through it as well as two other lines of lesser importance. The Vltava River is also used for transport.
