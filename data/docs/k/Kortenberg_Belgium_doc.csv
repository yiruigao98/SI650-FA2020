== History ==
On the territory of Erps-Kwerps an ancient Roman villa has been excavated. The same archeological site revealed a burial-ground of the Frankish civilisation.
In 1095, Gualgericus, Bishop of Cambrai, acknowledged the existence of a religious community on the Curtenbergh (meaning 'short hill'). For this reason, 1095 has been accepted as the founding year of Kortenberg. The conventuals moved in 1222 from the hill (the 'Curtenbergh') to lower grounds at the Minneveld, where the Abbey of Kortenberg still exists on this day.
From these early days, the Lords of Cortenberg lived in this village. They were of great significance in the history of the duchy of Brabant. 
The formerly independent municipality of Erps had the main bailiwick in the area since 1286.
The construction of a paved road from 1706 until 1709 was an important event in the growth of the municipality, together with the construction of a railroad in 1866. In the end of the nineteenth century the new bourgeoisie built a whole range of new residences in the style of the Belle Epoque with the typical spires.
On 27 August 1914 German troops put a local brewery, some residences and a little castle on fire while invading Kortenberg.


== Abbey of Kortenberg ==

There has been a Benedictine abbey in Kortenberg since 1222. In 1312, John II, Duke of Brabant signed the Charter of Kortenberg in the abbey, thereby establishing a constitution for the entire Duchy of Brabant and granting powers to a precursory democratic institution. After the Magna Carta, it is the second document in western history to limit the powers of monarchs in favour of a number of civil freedoms.
The abbey has a stirring history of arson, plundering and reconstruction. The oldest still remaining parts are the gate building with the gothic spired gate from the early seventeenth century, the Cattle Courtyard (Veehof) from 1650, the lease courtyard, the Brewery from 1732, and the abbey castle which was built from 1779 until 1783. The traditional great hall and the baroque chapel are dated from 1934. The abbey, which is owned by the diocese, became a protected monument on 14 February 2005 as part of resolution made by the Flemish government. The Old Abbey Kortenberg is a center of contemplation. Today, the grounds have been opened to the public as a park for recreational use.
