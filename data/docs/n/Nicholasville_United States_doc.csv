== Government ==

The Nicholasville government operates under a non-partisan city commission, which exercises both executive and legislative powers. The commission is composed of a mayor and four commissioners; all are elected at-large, requiring each candidate to gain the support of the majority of the electorate. In addition, the four commissioners are elected to manage particular city departments. They serve two-year terms; the mayor is elected to a four-year term. The commission wields all executive, legislative, and administrative powers.
In 2012, there was a proposal on the ballot to change the form of city government to that of a mayorâ€“council government, in order to separate the legislative and executive functions, but the proposal was defeated.Commissioners draft and pass laws and, by managing their respective departments, ensure the laws are carried out efficiently. The mayor administers oaths, signs documents on the city's behalf, and conducts commission meetings. As a member of the commission, the mayor has legislative powers equal to that of the commissioners. Commission meetings take place twice monthly.
