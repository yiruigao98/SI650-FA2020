== Toponymy ==
The word nakhon originates from the Sanskrit word nagara (Devanagari:  नगर) meaning 'city', and the word nayok is thought to have been derived from the Sanskrit nāyaka (Devanagari:  नायक) meaning 'leader' or 'captain'. However, in this connection, na means '[tax of] rice field' and yok means 'exempted'. Hence the name of the province literally means 'tax-free city'.


== History ==
The city of Nakhon Nayok dates back to the Dvaravati Kingdom, probably founded in the 11th century. Ruins from this time are visible at Mueang Boran Dong Lakhon south of the modern city. Originally named Mueang Lablae, the name "Nakhon Nayok" was assigned to it in 1350, when it became a garrison town of the Ayutthaya kingdom protecting the eastern boundary.
On 1 January 1943 the government downgraded Nakhon Nayok Province and combined it with Prachinburi Province, except for Ban Na District which became part of Saraburi Province. On 9 May 1946 the province was re-established.


== Symbols ==
The provincial seal shows an elephant holding an ear of rice with its trunk. This symbolizes fertile rice fields, as well as the forests with numerous elephants. In the background two piles of straw, trees, and clouds symbolizing the natural beauty of the province.
The provincial flower and tree is the silk cotton tree (Cochlospermum religiosum).

== Geography ==

The northern part of the province is in the Sankamphaeng Range, the southern prolongation of the Dong Phaya Yen mountains, with the highest elevation the 1,292 meter high Yod Khao Kiew. Most of that area is covered by the Khao Yai National Park. The central part of the province however is a rather flat river plain formed by the Nakhon Nayok River. The southern part of the province has relatively infertile acidic soil.
The main river of the province is the Nakhon Nayok River. It joins the Prachinburi River at Pak Nam Yothaka in Ban Sang District, Prachinburi Province, which then becomes the Bang Pa Kong River.
