== Climate ==
Nemuro, like most of Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), but not far from a marine climate (Koppen: Cfb) due to its low amplitude for a location close to Eurasia and average temperatures during the winter. It has mild to warm summers and cold snowy winters. Like the more northerly Kuril Islands, it has an extremely strong seasonal lag, with the highest temperatures in August and September and lowest in February, though it is not so gloomy as extremely foggy North Pacific islands like Simushir or the Aleutian Islands. Its peninsular location makes Nemuro very windy, especially during autumn and winter, with mean wind speeds as high as 22.7 kilometres per hour (14.1 mph) in November.

Nemuro also is the origin of two sushi restaurants in Hokkaido: Matsuriya and Hanamaru. Nemuro's seafood delicacies include their fresh Pacific saury, salmon, king crab, and shrimp.
Other delicacies in Nemuro include yakitori bento, Holland sanbei (waffle-like snack), soft serve ice cream, and monjayaki.


== Economy ==
Nemuro's economy is based on its fishing industry as many types of marine animals are found in the area all year long. Dairy product processing is also important to the local economy. Local businesses (like restaurants) and tourism also plays a significant role in the economy. Nemuro boasts the largest catches of saury in all of Japan. This  has led to efforts to export saury to Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam.
