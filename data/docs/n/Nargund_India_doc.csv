== Geography ==

The name "Nargund" comes from "Nari Gundu", which means "Hillock of Foxes" in Kannada. The town is marked by such a hillock right in the centre of town. Although known to be a place full of foxes in the past, it has none now and is pocked with windmills on all sides.


== Nargund Fort ==
Nargund Fort is located on a hill in the center of town. It was created by the famous Maratha King Chhatrapati Shivaji in 1675. It has been witness to many a battle.
It was different from other forts created by Shivaji. It had amazing architecture. The fort was planned to be challenging for any enemy to capture it. It was established in order to delay annexation by the Mughals of the territory, acting as a stronghold over the area. Most of the area inside Nargund Fort was used by Shivaji's army. Unlike other forts in Karnataka, Nargund Fort had no fortresses or multiple floors (storeys). There was no garden or sanctuary inside. Shivaji did not believe such structures to be essential to the fort and, therefore, did not waste the time or resources on constructing them. Aside from a few ornamental components, the architecture of Nargund Fort was based on bare essentials such as a reservoir, an ammunition storage space, a large well for uninterrupted water supply and watch towers. As of now, the great Nargund Fort has become a ruin. Most of the structures inside the fort have been destroyed over time. The place has become an open field; anyone can enter it unhindered. It is under the custody of the Government of Karnataka. Entry is unrestricted and very little has been done in order to renovate it. Gradually, the once great fort is in the process of becoming just a memory. It was under Maratha rulers for 15 years after its creation. Later, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb invaded the fort and captured it, by defeating the Maratha army. However, the courageous Marathas again captured the fort from Mughal rulers under Ramrao Dadaji Bhave in 1707. In the 18th century Nargund Fort along with the surrounding region was under the authority of King Venkat Rao of the Bhave family, which was subservient to the Marathas. The suzerainty of the Maratha rulers over Nargund Fort remained till 1778, when it was captured by the King of Mysore, Hyder Ali. In 1784, Hyder Ali's son, Tipu Sultan, controlled the fort. Nargund Fort played a vital part during the revolt against the British - the Sepoy Mutiny - of 1857. Who has not heard the name of ‘BABASAHIB’ of Nargund? It was he who raised a mutiny against British rule in India in 1858 and gave a clarion call of freedom to Indians. Known for his courage, valor and love of freedom, Babasahib of Nargund stood like a rock and fought like a lion against British authority. By killing Manson, the Political Agent of South India, he sent shivers up the spines of the British. But it was unfortunate that his own people stabbed him at the back and saw to his defeat and downfall. At the time, the fort was occupied by Bhaskar Rao Bhave, who administered the Nargund area. He defeated the British army, which attacked the fort in order to seize it. Later, under the leadership of Major Malcolm, Nargund Fort was captured by the British army. Although Nargund Fort has become a ruin, it has historical importance which makes it a place ideal for tourism. Tourists can see the remains of the historical fort. Also, one can enjoy the sight of the open fields beside it and the hillside.
