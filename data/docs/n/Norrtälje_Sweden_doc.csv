Norrtälje is a locality and the seat of Norrtälje Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 17,275 inhabitants in 2010. It is one of the largest towns in Roslagen.


== History ==
Norrtälje’s early history dates back to the Iron Age. Around 225 ancient monuments have been found within what is now the city. Three ancient castles are assumed to have stood in the former villages Nordrona, Solbacka and Knutby. Norrtälje traces its more recent history to 1219, when the location was first mentioned as Tälje. After some time, the name officially became Norrtälje, to distinguish it from the other Tälje in the province, Södertälje. The city arms were created as an upside down anchor as early as 1622 when the charter was granted.
In 1719, large parts of the central town were burnt down by a Russian army during the Russian Pillage of 1719–21. The new stone church was not finished until 1726, and it was another four years before the city hall was completed.
Norrtälje had a railway station on the narrow gauge Roslagsbanan from 1884 to 1969. It is now served by SL buses as a part of the system of public transport in Stockholm.
Norrtälje has a first class industrial heritage displayed in the Pythagoras Mechanical Workshop Museum, based in the premises of a former hot bulb engine factory.


== Climate ==
Norrtälje has a humid continental climate with some maritime influence. In comparison to county seat and national capital Stockholm some 70 kilometres (43 mi) to the south, Norrtälje has higher snowfall and cooler temperatures. Summers are highly variable and can be either very warm or quite subdued. The charts are from the 1961-1990 reference data, and in surrounding stations these temperature figures have risen since, which could potentially render Norrtälje leaning more towards a cool maritime climate in latter decades. The official station number assigned to Norrtälje is 8644.
