== History ==
During the Samhan Period Buan County was called Mahan, and it was also called Jiban statelets among the 54 Mahan statelets. 
During the Beakjae Period there were two small localities: Gaehwa and Heunlyangmae. In B.C 757(16th year of King Gyeongdeok's regime), after Silla united the three kingdoms, Gyehwa was renamed as Buryeong (sometimes called Gyebal) and was a part of Gobu. Honliang was renamed as Hee-an and was also a part of Gobu.
During the Goryeo period, the county was called Boan-hyeon and was also nicknamed as Namju. In late Goryeo, during King U's regime, there were local governors were posted to Buryeong-hyeon and Boan-hyeon.
In the Joseon period
During year 14 and 16 of king Taejong's regime, the two localities Buryeong-hyeon and Boan-hyeon were merged and separated several times. Then in December 1416, the two localities were merged and was named Buan, the "bu" coming from Buryeong and the "an" coming from Boan. The following year a locality named Heungdeokjin was made a part of Buan and was renamed as Buanjin. A high-level civil servant named the Byeongmasa ruled over the county. In 1423 (5th year of King Sejong's regime), the ruler was changed from Cheomjeoljesa to Hyeongam. Locality Buan was changed into Boan County in 1895 (32nd year of King Gojong's regime), when several different terms representing localities (bu, mok, gun, and hyeon) were unified to a single therm - gun(county).
