This is a list of cities in the United States by elevation. To be included on the list, the city needs an elevation of 3,000 feet (914 m) or higher. In the United States, settlements above 3,000 feet are found primarily on the High Plains, in the Rocky Mountains, and in Western North Carolina, however, many from the aforementioned locations are not presently listed; this list should not be seen as exhaustive.
