Narangba is a town and suburb of the Moreton Bay Region, Queensland, Australia. It is located 34 km north of Brisbane. 
This suburb has rural origins, but is being redeveloped as a residential suburb on the outskirts of the greater Brisbane metropolitan area. In the 2016 census, Narangba had a population of 18,573 people.


== History ==
The name Narangba possibly originated from an Aboriginal word meaning "small ridge", and that describes the area where the railway station with its associated township was situated. Earlier, it was part of an area referred to as Stoney Creek. The railway station was first called Sideling Creek Station, later renamed as Narangba. The suburb lies within the Burpengary Creek catchment area.
An award-winning Development Control Plan has resulted in major residential interest regarding the areas of Narangba and Burpengary, with infrastructure matching population growth. An industrial estate providing services required by manufacturing and general industries has taken full advantage of the shire's transport corridors, with sites on either side of the Bruce Highway.
