== Names ==
In the name "Nanyang" (simplified Chinese: 南阳; traditional Chinese: 南陽; pinyin: Nányáng), Nan (南) means south, and Yang (阳/陽) means sun—the south side of a mountain, or the north side of a river, in Chinese is called Yang. The name came from Nanyang Commandery, a commandery established in the region during the Warring States period. Before the name "Nanyang" became associated with the city itself, it was referred to as "Wan" (宛).


== History ==
Nanyang was the capital of the state of Shen in the first millennium BCE. It became commercially important under the Han dynasty, as it had many iron foundries and other manufacturing sites, and also fell at the convergence of routes between major cities. In the Dong Han period, it was known for business and luxury, and was for a time the southern capital. It subsequently declined somewhat in importance, but remained a political and cultural center of southwestern Henan province and a hub for trade.


== Geography ==
Nanyang is located in southwestern Henan, bordering Hubei (Xiangyang, Shiyan, and Suizhou) to the south, Shaanxi (Shangluo) to the west and the following prefecture-level cities in Henan:

Zhumadian (E)
Xinyang (SE)
Sanmenxia (NW)
Luoyang (N)
Pingdingshan (NE)The latitude of the entire prefecture ranges from 32° 17' to 33° 48' N, while the longitude ranges from 110° 58' to 113° 49' E, and the prefecture spans 26,600 square kilometres (10,300 sq mi). The city lies within the Nanyang Basin, which is part of a region in Central China that lies in the gap between the eastern end of the Qin Mountains and the source of the Huai River. Thus, using those two geographic features as the standard dividing line, it is difficult to classify the city into northern or southern China.
To the north of Nanyang city proper, there is a mountain called Mount Du, which is famous for the Dushan jade, one of the four famous jades of China, now a rarity. To the southwest is Neixiang County with the newly developing Baotianman Biosphere Reserve—an area of high biodiversity, with 65 rare and endangered species.
