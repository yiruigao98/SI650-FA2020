Henry Cousin, a British Archaeologist, wrote in his book "Sindhi's Archeology" (Sindhi Translation "Sindh Ja Qadeem Aasaar" by Ata Muhammad Bhambro) that the bricks used in the construction of this tomb were made and prepared in the Buddhist Rulers' period. The line painting for the birth of Gaotam Budh was clearly shown on the bricks, now preserved by the Sindh Archeological Department. He wrote that the ornaments, small effigies and statues were also found when the ground was dug around the tomb.
