Bang Khae (Thai: บางแค, pronounced [bāːŋ kʰɛ̄ː]) is one of the 50 districts (khet) of Bangkok, Thailand. Its neighboring districts, clockwise from north, are Thawi Watthana, Taling Chan, Phasi Charoen, Bang Bon, and Nong Khaem District.


== History ==
Formerly, Bang Khae was a tambon of Amphoe Phasi Charoen, Thonburi Province.
In 1972, Thonburi and Phra Nakhon Provinces were combined into Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, and Bang Khae became a sub-district of the Phasi Charoen District of the newly combined province. Although subdivisions of the capital city remained the same at the time, the names for the administrative units used within the city were renamed as districts (khet) and sub-districts (khwaeng), replacing amphoe and tambon, respectively.
Later, due to population increases in the western area of Phasi Charoen District, a new district, Phasi Charoen Sakha 1, was created. It included Bang Khae, Bang Khae Nuea, and Bang Phai Sub-districts.
From 6 March 1998, Phasi Charoen Sakha 1 district was combined with Lak Song sub-district, formerly part of Nong Khaem District, to form a new district, called Khet Bang Khae. The sub-districts of the new Bang Khae district then consisted of Bang Khae, Bang Khae Nuea, Bang Phai and Lak Song.Together with the creation of the district, the four sub-districts of Bang Khae were reorganized for administrative purposes. In 2009 the subdistrict boundaries were adjusted again.Its name means "county of the hummingbird tree"; presumably, in the past there was a large population of this species in the district.

The district is divided into four sub-districts (khwaeng).
