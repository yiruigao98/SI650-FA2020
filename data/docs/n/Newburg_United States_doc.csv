Newburg is a city in Phelps County, Missouri, United States. The population was 470 at the 2010 census.


== History ==
Newburg was founded in 1883 by St. Louis – San Francisco Railway as a division point for the railroad, where engines would stop for repairs and to change crews. It is currently used heavily by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad as a maintenance stop, with a large supply of railroad materials along the double tracks.Iron working was attempted twice in Newburg. Easy access to the railroad made heavy industry a viable business. Construction of the Ozark Iron Works began after 1867, but the business went bankrupt in 1877. The Knotwell Iron Company attempted to use the facilities in 1880, but quit shortly afterwards due to a severe drop in iron prices.After World War II, the railway switched from coal to diesel engines, which could run much longer distances without refueling. The Newburg stop was closed, removing the roundhouse, turntable, and freight yards. A single "Frisco" caboose remains near the old freight yards.Missouri University of Science and Technology in nearby Rolla has planned and implemented many projects in the city of Newburg.
The Community Theater, Gourd Creek Cave Archeological Site, Onyx Cave, and Ozark Iron Furnace Stack are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
