However, in 1934 the farm was disbanded and turned into a factory.
In the fall of 1967, it was chosen as the reference framework for the development of a regional gas bearing deposit. Surrounded by numerous lakes, the village situated on an elevated dry place was chosen for a runway for the airline industry.
