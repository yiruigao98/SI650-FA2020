The nucleus of what today is the town of Norzagaray traces from the old barrio Casay and barrio Matictic which was ecclesiastically and politically administered by the Augustinians from the town of Angat as its visitas as shown in the document "Mapa del Teritorio de Bulacan" by Fray Emmanuel Blanco O.S.A in 1832 which appeared in another document "Administracion Espiritual de los Padres Agustinos calzados de la Provincia del Dulce Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas" of Fray Francisco Villacorta in 1833.
The people of Barrio Casay worked for reforms politically, socially and economically, in order to be separated from Angat. They succeeded in their separation bid through Governor-General Fernándo Norzagaray y Escudero (1857-1860) who issued a Real Cedula declaring barrio Casay together with barrio Matictic to be constituted as a new independent town from Angat. Political boundaries of Angat and Pueblo de Casay y Matictic were demarcated and the newly created town was renamed as "Norzagaray" in honor of the said Governor-General Fernando de Norzagaray.

== Tourism ==

Today, the town of Norzagaray is quickly rising in terms of commercial and economic status with tourist potentials. "Bakas" which  is on a portion of the Angat River is recognized as one of the busiest places in the locality, particularly during summertime. People from distant towns often visit the place for relaxation.
Another potential spot for tourism is the Angat Watershed Forest Reserve where the Angat River Hydroelectric Plant or Angat Dam is located. The dam is the biggest hydroelectric plant the National Power Corporation (NPC) has ever constructed in terms of power capacity within the entire Philippines. Because of Angat Dam's size, its reservoir sinks to critical levels during the dry season necessitating the need for cloud seeding in some years.  The 37-kilometre (23 mi) reservoir of this hydroelectric plant is covered with forests producing a cool climate.
Another is the Pinagrealan Cave located in Barangay Bigte. This cave is a subterranean network of caverns extending more than a kilometer deep. The Katipunero Revolutionaries during the war against Spain used it as a camp in 1896 and again during the Filipino-American War in 1898 as hideout of General Emilio Aguinaldo (the First President of the Philippines). It was also used as a sanctuary by the Japanese Imperial Army when the Philippines was liberated by joint Filipino and American Forces.
There are still other sites with tourism potential in the locality. However, some of these places are located in remote areas of the town, which are inaccessible to motor vehicles, therefore in need of immediate attention.
