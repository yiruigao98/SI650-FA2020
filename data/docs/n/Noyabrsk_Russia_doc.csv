== Crime ==
Noyabrsk was a very young and partially closed town during the Soviet era, with a predominantly professional working population, which provided some protection from external criminal influence. With its opening in the early 1990s and with oil and gas industry maintaining relatively high living standards in the economic turmoil of Post-Soviet Russia, illicit drug business became highly profitable, drawing criminal elements from other regions. The situation was compounded by the police and officials being corrupted and ill-equipped to tackle the problem and by the general lack of occupations for the teenagers. The drug abuse situation in Noyabrsk was covered on national TV and in other media and finally official and citizen organisations arose to fight the problem.On March 17, 2009, a criminal case against the mayor Nikolay Korobkov was sent to court. According to the prosecution, he transferred some municipal property to a private company when he didn't have the power to do so.


== Twin towns and sister cities ==
