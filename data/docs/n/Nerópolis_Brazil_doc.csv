The region was part of the municipality of Pirenópolis until 1892 when it became part of Santana das Antas, present-day Anápolis.  In 1894 Joaquim Taveira established himself with his family to cut down the trees and plant crops.  He attracted other families and soon a settlement arose with the name  Matinha dos Taveiras.  In 1904 this name was changed to Campo Alegre.  In 1918 the name was changed again to Cerrado, and then in 1930 to Nerópolis,  a tribute to Senator Nero Macedo, an early twentieth century politician who had promised to bring the railroad to the region.  It became a municipality in 1948.
