== History ==

Næstved has roots as far back as 400-500 BC. Archaeological material from this period has been found in the soil under Næstved, and tells of human life here long before the Viking era.
The name of the city, Næstved, derives from two words: Næs and Tved. Tved means "cleared land" or "cleared wood" (as "thwaite" in English toponyms), and refers to the city's origin in the woods of southern Zealand, on the banks of the Suså. "Næs" is the Danish word for a small peninsula (as "ness" in English toponyms), and probably refers to the city's placing on the peninsulas Ydernæs, Grimstrup Næs, and Appenæs.
In 1135, Benedictine monks received Saint Peter's Church and surrounding land in order to found St. Peter's Priory. This is seen as the foundation of the town of Næstved, although the town appears to have existed already at that time, being both big and important to the region.


== Culture ==

Næstved has various museums, concert-venues, theaters and exhibitions of all kinds during the year.


=== Churches ===

Næstved has five Danish National Churches: St. Martin's Church, St. Peter's Church, Saint John's Church, Herlufsholm Church, and Holsted Church.  There are other churches in the town, such as Sjølundkirken.  


=== Music and stage arts ===
Grønnegades Kaserne Kulturcenter was opened in 2002 in what used to be military barracks. It is in the center of the city, only five minutes walk away from the station. Denmark's top artists perform here, along with various names from abroad. Amongst the best-known foreign artists to have visited Næstved over the last few years are Electric Light Orchestra, Beth Hart, Runrig and Modern Talking.
In recent years, various theatres have emerged in Næstved, culminating with the creation of an "Egns Teater" - a local theatre - in 2006. Performances by talented local artists add to Næstved's position as a cultural stronghold on Zealand outside Copenhagen.
"Studenternes Hus" downtown (House of Students) is also a widely known and frequently used venue for local and national acts, as well as mid-range artistes from abroad. Cheap entry fees and a relaxed atmosphere attract a young crowd.

Næstved has a range of museums of local importance. In the city centre, Næstved Museum offers the full story of Næstved - from the very first settlements till this day. In Stenboderne, near St. Peter's Church, a collection of ancient findings are on show, including pottery, armory and more.
Næstved Museum has exhibits covering the development of Kähler Ceramics and Holmegaard Glass. It is open to visitors every day except Monday. There are also interesting exhibits on textiles, toys and silverware. The museum consists of two separate buildings: Helligåndshuset on Ringstedgade to the north of the central square and Boderne on Sct. Peters Kirkeplads to the southwest.

On 1 January 2007, the size and population of the municipality of Næstved increased, as the government decided to merge four smaller municipalities with the municipality of Næstved. Næstved emerged with nearby Fuglebjerg, Fladså, Holmegaard and Suså, increasing population in the municipality of Næstved to more than 80.000. That made Næstved the second-largest town on Zealand, only outranked by the capital, Copenhagen.
Experienced mayor, Henning Jensen, led the city through the merger, and stayed head of the city council, with the four mayors from the other merged municipalities taking place as members of the council. Henning Jensen remained mayor of Næstved until 2011.

== Shopping ==


=== Næstved Stor Center ===
In 1989, a large shopping mall was established on what was then the outskirts of the city. The mall is called Næstved Storcenter (Næstved Big Center), and houses over 80 shops. Clothing, Danish design and much more can be found here. The center also offers seven restaurants of various kinds, from Mexican cuisine to pizzas, and hamburgers. People from most of Zealand come here to shop, and the large warehouse, BILKA, attracts a lot of customers.
Næstved Storcenter is on the outer edge of the city, and is easily accessible by bus (from Næstved Station) and by train (Næstved Nord Station is a five-minute walk from the mall entrance).


=== Næstved Mega Center ===
Just next to Næstved Storcenter you will find Næstved Mega Center, which, though, in comparison is rather small. Næstved Megacenter is home for approx. 10 large stores offering everything from electronics to baby-wear.


=== Næstved City Centre ===
The heart of the city has a large pedestrian area for a place of its size.
Every Wednesday and Saturday there's a market in the city centre on "Axeltorv" (Axle Square) - a very old square, dating back to the founding of the city.Næstved has always been a hub of trade and commerce. Even before the year 1274 Næstved enjoyed the status of being a royal market town, and the market square itself predates 1140. The two names – Axeltorv (“Axle Square”) and Hjultorv (“Wheel Square”) – tell us that the market wares arrived and were sold on wheels. 
Today, Næstved is known for its shopping centres and an attractive town environment full of specialist shops. Market days are still held on Axeltorv Wednesday and Saturday every week, and every year the town centre holds its own “City Night” (mostly held on Fridays). This event often features music and other kinda of Entertainment, the shops stay open late until 10pm.

Over the last 10 years, Næstved has developed into a more lively city than before. The trend of going out to cafés struck Næstved in the beginning of this century, and today, the town offers several cafés in the City Centre.
Also, the population has increased heavily, and actually Næstved is the second fastest growing city in Denmark, only out-performed by Denmark's second largest city Aarhus. More people means more ideas, and that shows in Næstved, where new galleries, workshops and the like have been established in recent years.
The traffic in down-town Næstved can be very congested at times. New roads around the city has solved part of this problem, but the traffic can still be heavy, specially around 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.

The old pottery is still located downtown Næstved on "Kählersbakken", a ten-minute walk from the Axeltorv Square in the city centre.


== Transport ==
Easy access to the city is one of the top priorities for the local politicians of Næstved. Rail and roads are administrated by the State, so there is a lot of Lobbying going on behind the scenes. Locals are trying to get a motorway-connection for the city these days, but so far without success. On the other hand, the railways to and from Næstved have been improved greatly over the years, making Næstved easily accessible by train from most parts of Zealand.


=== Railways ===
Næstved has two stations both operated by DSB, Næstved Station and Næstved Nord Station. Næstved Station serves trains on the Sydbanen line, and is the southern terminus for trains on the Lille Syd line. German ICE trains on the Copenhagen-Hamburg route stop at Næstved station. Næstved Nord only serves the Lille Syd line.
Heavy traffic on the motorways to Copenhagen has increased the number of commuters using rail-transport to and from the Copenhagen area.


=== Buses ===
A broad network of buses connects Næstved City to its urban area, as well as all major surrounding cities. Ticketprices are reasonable, and tickets are bought from the driver when boarding the bus.
All buses depart from the bus-terminal at Næstved Station in the center of the town.


=== Roads ===
The infrastructure in Næstved has been under pressure for some years now. The roads in the city center are heavily crowded at mornings and in the afternoon. The absence of a direct motorway-connection to Copenhagen has led to numerous discussions over the years, but still, Næstveders have to take the 15-minute roadtrip to nearby Rønnede (East of the city) to access the E47/E55, connecting the area to the rest of Europe.
There are direct road connections to nearby Ringsted, Rønnede, Slagelse, Præstø and Vordingborg (80 km/h) - all four cities within 30 minutes reach.


=== Motorway Næstved - Rønnede ===
The Danish Road Directorate have made a study of a possible motorway between Næstved and Rønnede. The study shows that a motorway will cost a one billion DKK.
On 17 January 2013 the Danish Road Directorate had invited citizens, local politicians and others who were 
interested, to a public meeting in Toksværd near Holme Olstrup. During this meeting, it 
was decided that the possible motorway (Næstvedmotorvejen) should be connected 
near the outskirts of Rønnede, by the upcoming 
business area of Eco Valley, near the South Motorway (Sydmotorvejen).
At the same time, both municipalities, and politicians will work for the completion of the motorway in approximately 10 years (by 2023).
In 2014 the funds for the first leg of the construction fase of the Motorway was allocated by the Danish government. The motorway between Rønnede and Boserup expected to be completed in 2021.


== Telecommunication ==
At Næstved, there is a 220.1 metres tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting.


== Næstved Harbour ==

Næstved Harbour is in the middle of the city and in a central location in Denmark, near to Storebæltsbroen (The Great Belt Bridge), and the Fehmarn connection can be reached within an hour by road.
One of the biggest stone plants in the country for the refinement of seabed materials is situated at Næstved Harbour. One of the reasons why the company chose to set up at Næstved Harbour was because it would be possible for their annual production of around 120 000 tonnes of material to be sent more quickly to customers - and because Næstved Harbour has exactly the kind of storage capacity required, regardless of whether goods are to be stored for a long time or just briefly.
