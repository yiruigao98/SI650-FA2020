== History ==

In the 10th century the area became part of Poland. Probably then the first Catholic chapel was established in present-day Nowogard. The town's origins go back to a fortified Slavic settlement which was the seat of the local castellan. The settlement was first mentioned in 1268 as "Nogart" when Barnim I, the Duke of Pomerania granted it as a fief to the Bishopric of Cammin. The bishops erected a castle in the city. In 1274, the town and its surrounding area was administered by Otto von Eberstein, it remained in the possession of the "von Eberstein" family until 1663. In 1309 the town adopted German town law.
In the first half of the 14th century, fortifications were erected with an oblong market square in the center of the town. This is where the town hall and the St. Mary's Church were erected. In 1663, after the death of the last Eberstein, Naugard became property of Ernst Bogislaw von Croÿ and in 1684, property of the electors of Brandenburg. During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1807, the town was captured by allied Polish-French-Italian forces. Until 1945 the town was part of Germany. During World War II many forced labourers of different nationalities were brought to the town.Throughout the Soviet East Pomeranian Offensive operation of World War II up to 60 percent of Naugard was destroyed. On the March 5, 1945, the town was taken by the Red Army, after which it was Polish territory and the population fled or was expelled from the city and the city was resettled with Poles. The first new Polish settlers were the freed forced labourers.
