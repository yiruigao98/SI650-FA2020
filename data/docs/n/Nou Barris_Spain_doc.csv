Nou Barris (Catalan pronunciation: [ˈnɔw ˈβaris], lit. "nine neighbourhoods") is one of the ten districts into which Barcelona has been officially divided since 1984. The name refers to the original nine neighbourhoods it was composed of, even though nowadays it's made up of thirteen. It covers an area of 8.04 km2.
It is located in the northern part of the city adjacent to two other districts of Barcelona: Sant Andreu and Horta-Guinardó and grew up extensively out of small urbanised areas near the former municipalities of Sant Joan d'Horta and Sant Andreu de Palomar (now neighbourhoods of Barcelona) in the 20th century, especially from the 1950s on. The district council is located in a former mental institution, the Institut Mental de la Santa Creu.
