== History ==

Once part of the Düppel manor, from 1901 onwards the area was developed as a mansion colony (Villenkolonie Nikolassee). One year later, the settlement received connection to the Berlin-Blankenheim and Wannsee Railway lines with the opening of Berlin-Nikolassee station.Originally an independent Brandenburg municipality, Nikolassee was incorporated into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. Part of West Berlin during the "Cold War", its southern border with the municipality of Kleinmachnow, at the same time the border between the American Sector and what was to be the East Germany, was fortified by the Berlin Wall between 1961 and 1989. Located on the present A 115 motorway was the US Checkpoint Bravo (Drewitz-Dreilinden), built in 1969.


== Transport ==
Nikolassee is served by the S-Bahn lines S1, S5  and S7, at the homonymous station. The locality is also crossed by the motorway A 115 (the former AVUS, exit "Spanischer Allee"), and by the federal highway B1.
