== History ==


=== Paleolithic Age ===

=== Neolithic Age ===
Traces of Neolithic culture were found at Chota Yelupu, where sling stones and other contemporary objects were excavated.  Evidence of Megalithic culture was also found via the discovery of innumerable burials at various places around Nalgonda.


=== The Mauryas and Satavahanas (230 BC – 218 BC) ===
The political history of the Nalgonda district commences with the Mauryas.  During the reign of Ashoka the Great, the Mauryas maintained control over the Nalgonda region.  Later, the Satavahanas, who ruled between 230 BC and 218 BC, took control of the area.
During this period, the region established trade contacts with the Roman Empire.


=== Ikshvakus (227 AD – 306 AD) ===
In 227 AD, the Ikshvaku dynasty took control of the region.  During this period, members of various Saka tribes migrated to the area. Buddhism flourished during this time.


=== Invasion of Samudragupta ===
After the Ikshvakus, the Pallavas and Yadavas fought for supremacy over the region.  However, after Samudragupta (c. 335 AD – c. 375 AD) invaded and conquered most of India, the area fell under the control of his Gupta Empire.  The Empire fell in the 6th century.


=== The Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas ===

The Chalukyas continued to rule the area until the end of the 12th century.


=== Medieval period ===
During the medieval era, the Kakatiya dynasty took control of the region from the western Chalukyas.  During the reign of Prataparudra II, in 1323, the kingdom was annexed to the Tughluq Empire.
When Muhammad bin Tughluq ruled (around 1324–1351), Musunuri chief Kapayanayaka ceded a part of Nalgonda to Ala-ud-din Hasan Bahman Shah of the Bahmani Sultanate.  He annexed the region to the Bahmani Kingdom.
In 1455, Jalal Khan he declared himself king at Nalgonda, but this was short-lived.  He was quickly defeated and the region brought back to the Bahmani Kingdom.
During the time of the Bahmani Sultan Shihabud-din Mahmun, Sultan Quli was appointed as tarafdar of the Telangana region (now the state of Telangana).  Quli's son, Jamshid, took control of the region from his father.  Later, Qutub Shahis took control of the region, and maintained it until 1687.


=== Modern period: Mughals and Asaf Jahis ===
Nizam-ul-Mulk (Asaf Jah I) defeated Mubasiz Khan at Shaker Khere in Berar and ruled the Deccan autonomously.  This district, like the other districts of Telangana, was controlled by Asaf Jahis, and remained under their rule for nearly two hundred and twenty-five years.
