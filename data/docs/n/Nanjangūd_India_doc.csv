Nanjangud officially known as Nanjanagudu is a City and Taluk in Mysore district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Nanjangud lies on the banks of the river Kapila (Kabini), 23 km from the city of Mysore. Nanjangud is famous for Srikanteshwara Temple. Nanjangud is also called "Dakshina Kashi" (southern Kashi). This city is also famous for a variety of banana grown in the region, the Nanjanagoodu rasabale.


== Origin of the name ==
The Srikanteshwara Temple at Nanjangud is dedicated to the Hindu supreme deity Shiva, also called Sri Nanjundeshwara, ("The Lord who drank poison") to save the earth. In Hindu mythology, the Gods and demons churned the ocean in search of the ambrosia. During this churning, poison emanated first, followed by ambrosia. To prevent the poison from spreading across the universe, Shiva drank it. His consort Parvati then held his throat tightly to prevent the poison from spreading to the rest of his body. The poison remained in his throat, making it blue in colour. For this reason, Shiva is also called Neelakantha, or "the blue-throated one". Nanjanagud literally means "the place where Nanja (Nanjundeshwara) resides" in Kannada - Nanja is a short form of Nanjunda (Najannu unDava - one who drank poison), or "home of Nanja (Nanjundeshwara)". Srikanteshwara translates to Sri meaning auspicious, Kanta meaning throat and Eshwara meaning Shiva.


== History ==

Chola Kings in the 11th – 12th century are considered to have built this temple with significant additions by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings.

=== Parashurama Kshetra ===
Near Nanjangud is the sangam, where the Kapila and Kaundinya rivers meet. This place is termed as Parashurama Kshetra which is where the sage Parashurama is said to have cleansed himself from the sin of beheading his mother.It is said that Parashurama got immense peace of mind at this place which he did not get anywhere else. So he decided to make a penance at the place where Nanjundeshwara temple presently exists. At that time, only Adi Keshava Temple existed (which is now by the side of main-shrine). While cleaning up the place with his axe, he accidentally hit the head of Lord Shiva, who was performing penance underground. Blood started flowing and Parushurama was frightened to have committed another sin. Then Lord Shiva consoled him not to worry and build a temple of his, adjacent to Adi Keshava's. Lord Shiva also told Parashurama to perform penance at Nanjangud. Parashurama performed at the place where his temple presently is located. Lord Shiva was then immensely happy with it and gave blessings that those who visit Nanjangud should definitely visit Parashurama temple to complete their pilgrimage effectively and fruitfully.


=== Oldest bridge in India ===

The bridge is across Kabini river, which has been declared as the oldest bridge with both railway line and road on the same bridge by the Government of India. It is located at the entrance of temple town here. 
The Kabini Bridge was built by DalvoyDevraj in 1735 with brick, sand and stone in Gothic style. Though it was built before the railway tracks were laid, the bridge was and is more commonly labelled as a Railway bridge.  The Kabini Bridge has a series of Gothic arches of 10ft span with 8ft wide intervening piers. The earth cushion over the arch crest is over 5 feet. The foundations are laid on rocky strata and built in lime concrete. The bridge is of stone masonry with lime concrete filling and mortar. It has 51spans of 10 feet and before 1902 it existed as a road bridge ferrying bullock, camel and horse carriage traffic across the Kabini. A narrow gauge Railway line was being built from Mysore to Nanjangud in 1902 and the Railways used the arched bridge to connect it to the Nanjangud railway station. Trains ran on this bridge from 1902 to 2007. The last train to run on this heritage rail infrastructure was on January 17, 2007 when the Railways decided to put a stop to meter gauge trains and operate broad gauge trains. Since broad gauge needs a different alignment from narrow and meter gauges, a new bridge was built across the Kabini.The bridge, built in 1735, is now 283 years old and a Heritage Monument declared by the Government of India.
