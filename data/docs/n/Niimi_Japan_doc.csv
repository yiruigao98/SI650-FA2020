== History ==
Niimi was known as early as the Heian period (794 – 1185). A shōen manorial estate called Niimi-shō' occupied much of the area of present-day Niimi. Niimi, due to its location on the Takashi River, became an important center of inland trade. In the Sengoku period (1467 – 1573) the Seki clan controlled the area, and established the Niimi Domain. The modern city of Niimi was founded on June 1, 1954.
On March 31, 2005, Niimi absorbed the towns of Ōsa, Shingō, Tessei and Tetta (all from Atetsu District) to become a larger and expanded Niimi.
