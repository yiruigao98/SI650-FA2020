== History ==
The area was first settled by farmers who located their farms along the wooded streams near present-day Nixa. The area became a crossroads, as it was a half-day ride with a team of horses from Springfield. Teamsters found it a convenient stopover site when hauling freight between Springfield and Arkansas. The village became known as Faughts. An early resident, Nicholas A. Inman, was a blacksmith from Tennessee, who set up a shop in 1852. When a post office was opened, a town meeting was held to decide on a name for the new community. Because of his years of service to the community, the town was suggested to be named for him. Another suggestion was "nix" because the community was "nothing but a crossroads". The name Nix was finally decided upon, and Inman's middle initial "a" was added to get the unique name of Nixa. The village incorporated on June 10, 1902.

A local barber named Finis Gold started Nixa Sucker Day in 1957, and it has since been a longstanding tradition. Locals often closed up shop and skipped school for the day to go "grabbin’ for suckers". The fish were then frozen until enough were available for a big fish fry. Nixa Sucker Day was the result of this annual tradition.
The event is held annually during May. It is a family-friendly event held on Nixa's Main Street. Sucker fish and other kinds of food are sold by vendors. There are live entertainment and local crafts. Proceeds from Sucker Day activities are used to assist projects in the city such as scholarships to graduates from Nixa High School, donations to Project Graduation, and Nixa JROTC.
