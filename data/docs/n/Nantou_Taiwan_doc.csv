Nantou City (Mandarin Pīnyīn: Nántóu Shì; Hokkien POJ: Lâm-tâu-chhī) is a county-administered city located in the northwest of Nantou County, Taiwan. It lies between the Bagua Mountains and the Maoluo River and is the county seat of Nantou County. Freeway No. 3 serves Nantou City. Its name is a transliteration of the Hoanya word Ramtau with its first character (南; "south") chosen to complement that of Beitou's (北; "north"), a district in Taipei, even though there is no relation between the aboriginal names.


== History ==


=== Qing Dynasty ===
The Han Chinese began arriving in the area during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor of Qing Dynasty. Members of the Zhang clan from Zhangzhou as well as the Jian (簡), Lin and Xiao clans from Nanjing County in Zhangzhou were among the early settlers. A yamen was established in 1759 near the present Nantou Elementary School. In 1898, Nantou Commandery was organized.


=== Empire of Japan ===

In 1901, during Japanese rule, Nanto Chō (南投廳) was one of twenty local administrative offices established. In 1909, part of Toroku Chō (斗六廳) was merged into Nanto Chō. In 1920, Nantō Town was governed under Nantō District, Taichū Prefecture.


=== Republic of China ===
After handover to the Republic of China, Nantou County was organized out of Taichung County in 1950, and, in October of the same year, Nantou Township was organized with the county government seated in it. On 1 July 1957, the Taiwan provincial government moved to Zhongxing New Village, making Nantou the location of the provincial government. On 25 December 1981, Nantou became a county-controlled city from the previous urban township. Due to its location along the Chelungpu Fault, Nantou was strongly affected by the 1999 921 earthquake: 92 people died and over 1,000 buildings were damaged
