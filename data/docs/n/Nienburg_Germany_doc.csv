== History ==
The major reason for the emergence and development of Nienburg into the largest city in the Middle Weser region was its location at a convenient ford in the Weser River, leading to multiple trade routes radiating from the location. As early as 1025 the location was referred to as Negenborg, i.e. New Castle. In 1215 it began to be referred to as a city, a civitas, when Count Henry I of Hoya began the residence of his ruling line. From 1582 until 1866 the Guelph (Welf) Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg controlled the county, except for Napoleonic French rule from 1803 to 1813.The former suburb Wölpe refers to the Grafen (earl) von Wölpe and the associated castle. The Castle was destroyed in the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud in 1522.
