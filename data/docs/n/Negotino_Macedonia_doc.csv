== History ==

A settlement in the location of modern Negotino existed and developed in antiquity.
Between 278 and 242 BC, a city was founded by King Antigonus II Gonatas, under the name of Antigoneia (Αντιγονεία in Greek). After conquering Paionia, he conquered the settlements around the central Vardar region.
Antigoneia was situated some twelve Roman miles south of the ancient city of Stobi, on the road to Thessaloniki, at the location of modern Gradiste, near the railway station of Negotino. At this place, Roman coins were found, as well as precious jewelry and other archeological findings from the period of the Roman and Byzantine period.
The ancient city existed until the 11th century when it was destroyed by a disastrous earthquake which hit almost all of the territory of Macedonia along with other cities such as Skupi, Stobi, Heraclea, Astibo, and Idomena.
From 1929 to 1941, Negotino was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
