== Etymology ==
There are various theories linked to the origin of the name "Nellore". A mythological story from Sthala Purana depicts, a lingam in the form of a stone under nelli tree. The place gradually became Nelli-ooru ("Nelli" stands for emblica Tree and ooru generally stands for place) and then to present day Nellore. Another explanation is that the town got its name from the extensive cultivation of paddy in and around it. ("Nell"  meaning paddy and "ur" meaning town). The Gazetteer of the Nellore District considers the latter the more plausible etymology.
