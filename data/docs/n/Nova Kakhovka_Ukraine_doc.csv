== History ==
Nova Kakhovka was founded on 28 February 1952, in the place where, from 1891, the village Klyucheve had existed. It was in direct proximity of the established dam of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (1947–1948), and was built to house the plant's construction workers. Since its founding, the city has been called Nova Kakhovka, or New Kakhova, to distinguish from the city of Kakhovka located 15 km (9.3 mi) away. After the construction of the power plant was finished, most of the workers stayed in Nova Kakhovka. The city of Nova Kakhovka is recognized as one of the most successful colonization sites of the Ukrainian South in recent years and earned a title of the Pearl of Lower Dnieper (Official website of the city).
On October 10, 1950, the management of the "Dniprobud" created a housing department, which was tasked with the construction of a new town of power engineers.
April 20, 1951 laid the foundation of the first residential building on the street. K. Marx, 31, and already 30 May of the same year he was put into operation.
On February 10, 1952, a train arrived from Fedorivka to Nova Kakhovka. In total for 9 months 154 km of railways were built. At 12 o'clock a train with a load from Chelyabinsk, Moscow, Bryansk approached the triumphal arch, where he met thousands of builders. The railway became an important transport artery, which accelerated the construction of the hydroelectric plant, the city, suburban farms, and the entire center of the Kherson region.
On February 28, 1952, the working village of builders of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station was given the name "Nova Kakhovka" by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Initially it was assumed that it would be small, up to 20 thousand people, a city of power engineers.
However, due to the good geographical location in the center of the region, the availability of cheap electricity, railways, highways and waterways, which opened the way to a large-tonnage ship from the mouth of the Dnieper to the Pripyat, as well as highly skilled, experienced personnel potential, opened the city with broad prospects for development.
During the fall of 1950, school 1 and school 2 were opened.


== Geography ==

The city is sometimes referred to as an oasis, because it was built on an area where sand was plentiful. During the construction of the city, the parks and sod were built and lain on the sandy ground. Also, the architectural plans were developed to build streets and squares in the way they would harmonize perfectly with the shoreline of the reservoir.
