== History ==

For thousands of years prior to European settlement, succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area.  The Battlefords area (including the present city of North Battleford and town of Battleford) was home to several historic indigenous groups, including the Algonquian-speaking Cree and Blackfeet as well as Siouan Assiniboine First Nation band governments, who contested for control of local resources.
Early European settlement began as a result of fur trading by French colonists in the late 18th century. The Canadians founded Fort Montaigne d'Aigle (Eagle Hills Fort)  nine miles below the confluence of the Saskatchewan and Battle Rivers in 1778. A year later the fort was abandoned following conflict between traders and natives.Permanent European settlement in the area centred around the town of Battleford, founded 1875 and located on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River. Battleford served as capital of the North-West Territories between 1876 and 1883.In 1905, the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway main line to Edmonton placed the line on the north side of the North Saskatchewan River. North Battleford, built along the railway line, was incorporated as a village in 1906, as a town in 1907, and as a city (with a population of 5,000) in 1913.The Assyrians were one of the first settlers of the area in and around North Battleford. The immigrant colony comprised 36 men and a few women from the town of Urmia in northwestern Persia. It was established in 1903 by Dr. Isaac Adams, an Assyrian Presbyterian missionary. In 1907, 40 more settlers arrived. Eventually, due to economic hardships, Dr. Isaac Adams and a few close relatives emigrated to Turlock, California. The descendants of the families who remained in North Battleford have names that are Assyrian in origin. Examples of Assyrian family names include Bakus, Essau, and Odishaw.Population growth stagnated until the 1940s and then grew to approximately 10,000 by the 1960s.
The city has grown into an administrative centre and service hub for the economic, education, health and social needs of the region.The Latter Rain Revival, a Christian movement, started here in 1946–48.

=== Crime rate ===
In 2018, Macleans ranked North Battleford as Canada's most dangerous place for overall crime. The prior year, Macleans published an article about this, Canada’s most dangerous place, North Battleford, is fighting for its future, discussing the safety initiatives planned by the community.After the article was published, Mayor Ryan Bater said:

The reality is we require the provincial and federal levels of government to take notice of this and align their efforts with ours. This needs to be a partnership. This can’t be something the governments do in silos and we need to be working together. If we can do that, then sometime in the future we can see some great results.
City Manager Jim Puffalt added that the per person index may not be accurate because the population data does not consider the numerous transients, estimated at just over 14,000. In his view, the city has roughly 30,000 people at any time. "If you put our rates over 30,000 people we wouldn’t be number one [in the Macleans study]," he said.
