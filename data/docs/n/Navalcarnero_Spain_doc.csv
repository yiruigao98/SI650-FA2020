== History ==
By the end of 1499 the city of Segovia founded the location of Navalcarnero, to put an end to the conflicts around the area. Since 1480 (when the Catholic Monarchs disposed of the Sexmo de Valdemoro and the Sexmo de Casarrubios), the territory had been progressively occupied by the vassals of the Marquis of Moya and those of Comendador don Gonzalo Chacón.

On 10 October 1499 the first Mayor of Navalcarnero was elected from the six residents of Perales that founded the village.
Shortly after its foundation, in 1521, Alonso de Arreo, alderman and barrister of Navalcarnero helped Segovia in the Castilian War of the Communities.
Navalcarnero was under Segovian jurisdiction until 1627 (128 years), during which it was attacked several times and burned four times by the nearby domains. The city held a lawsuit against the Marquisate of Moya that lasted 93 years for the property of the Marimartín meadows. It also protected the rest of the municipality from don Gonzalo Chacón and his descendants for 118 years (until 1617).
In 1627 the municipality bought its own jurisdiction to the Crown, becoming an independent city; it kept, however, the Segovian coat of arms in its own.
Felipe IV married with Mariana de Austria in 1649 in Navalcarnero.
