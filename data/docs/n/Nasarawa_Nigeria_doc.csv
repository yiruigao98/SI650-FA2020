Nasarawa, also spelled Nassarawa, town, Nasarawa State, central Nigeria. The town lies just north of a fork in the Okwa River, which is a tributary of the Benue River. Nasarawa was founded in 1835 in the Afo (Afo) tribal territory by Umaru, a dissident official from the nearby town of Keffi, who hailed from Ruma in Katsina State, as the seat of the new emirate of Nassarawa. Umaru expanded his domain by conquering neighboring territory and made Nassarawa a vassal state to Zaria (175 miles [282 km] north). One of his successors, Muhammadu Sani (reigned 1878–1923), enlarged the emirate by various conquests and, in 1900, was one of the first emirs to pledge allegiance to Great Britain. In 1976 Nasarawa became part of Plateau State; in 1996, it became part of Nasarawa state
