Niamh (Irish pronunciation: [n̠ʲiəvˠ], from  Old Irish Niaṁ) is an Irish feminine given name (meaning "bright" or "radiant"),  anglicised as  Neve, Nieve, or Neave  .In Irish mythology, Niamh is the daughter of the god of the sea, Manannán mac Lir and one of the queens of Tír na nÓg, the land of eternal youth. She was the lover of the poet-hero Oisín. The first recorded use of Niamh (that spelling) as a given name in modern Ireland was in 1911, when two children were registered with the name and when a Niamh was listed in that year's census.The form Neve is also used as a Dutch and Flemish surname. The given name of Canadian actress Neve Campbell is derived from the Dutch surname, her mother's maiden name.
