== History ==
Nawab Najib-ud-Daula, also known as Najib Khan was a noted Rohilla Muslim warrior and serviceman of both the Mughal Empire and the Durrani empire, Nawab Najib-ud-Daula was a noted Rohilla tribal chief in 18th century Rohilkhand, who in the 1740s founded the city of Najibabad in Bijnor district, India where he established the present-day city of Najibabad, a state of Najibabad independent from Rohilla tribes, and received the title, "Nawab Najib-ud-Daulla". From 1757 to 1770 he was governor of Saharanpur, ruling over Dehradun.Many architectural relics of the period of Rohilla he oversaw remain in Najibabad, which he founded at the height of his career as a Mughal minister.
He succeed Safdarjung as Grand Wazir of the Mughal Empire and was a devoted serviceman of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II; later in his career he was known as Nawab Najib-ud-Doula.
According to George Foster ("A Journey from Bengal to England", 1790): Najibuddaulah, who built this town, saw that its situation would facilitate the commerce of Kashmir, which having been diverted from its former channel of Lahore and Delhi, by the inroads of Sicques [Sikhs], Maharattas and Afgans, took course through the mountains at the head of the Punjab and was introduced into the Rohilla (country) through the Lall Dong Pass. This inducement, with the desire of establishing a mart for the Hindoos of the adjacent mountains, probably influenced the choice of this spot, which otherwise is not favourable for the site of a capital town being low, and surrounded by swampy grounds…. since the death of its founder, Najibabad had fallen from its former importance and seems now chiefly upheld by the languishing trade of Kashmir.”
After the death of Najib-u-Daula, he was succeeded by his son Zabita Khan. His cemetery is still in present-day Najibabad.
In Najibabad, there was a fort of great Sultana Daku or "The Sultan Bandit". The fort is still situated in Najibabad.
