== History ==

Nowshera was developed during the Afghan Durrani Empire. The Battle of Nowshera was fought in March 1823 between the forces of Pashtuns with support from Azim Khan Barakzai, Durrani governor against the Sikh Khalsa Army of Ranjit Singh. The battle was a decisive victory for the Sikh Empire against Afghans and led to their occupation of the Peshawar Valley.During British rule, Nowshera was a town and cantonment as well as tehsil of the Peshawar District (later Peshawar Division). The town was on the route of the North-Western Railway and Grand Trunk Road. The population according to the 1901 census of India was 9,518.
The Imperial Gazetteer of India described the cantonment as follows:
The cantonment stretches along the right bank of the Kābul river on a sandy plain, 3 miles in diameter, and is surrounded by low hills on all sides except the north, which is open towards the river. The garrison now consists of one British infantry regiment, two Native cavalry and four infantry regiments, a mountain battery, and a bearer corps, belonging to the Peshāwar division of the Northern Command. The Kābul river is crossed by a permanent bridge of boats, whence roads lead to Mardān and Chārsadda. The iron road and railway bridge across the river was opened on December 1, 1903. The village of Naushahra Khurd, west of the cantonment, and the large village of Naushahra Kalān, on the north bank of the Kābul, are both outside cantonment limits. The headquarters of the Naushahra tahsīl, with the police station, are in the former, 3 miles from the cantonment. The town contains a Government dispensary and a vernacular middle school, maintained by the District board.
