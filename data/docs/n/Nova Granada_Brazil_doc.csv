== History ==
From the expansion of coffee in the North of the state of São Paulo, many settlers started to form farms, increasing the number of residents in the region. Thus, in 1911, Captain Francisco dos Santos founded near the Rio Grande settlement in the territory of São José do Rio Preto, with the original name of Vila Bela.
In a short time the first houses were built around the chapel of Saint Benedict patron saint, erected there. When the Police District was created, the village was renamed Pitangueiras again changed to New Granada, when elevated to District of Peace in 1917.
As the local chronicle, this name comes from the old Spanish immigrant settlers who came from Granada (Spain).
