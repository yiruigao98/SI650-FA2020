Nochistlán  (Spanish pronunciation: [notʃisˈtlan]) is a city in the Mexican state of  Zacatecas. Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán, on December 3, 1531, hired Cristóbal de Oñate to establish a village in Nochistlán; the village would be named Guadalajara to honor Guzmán for having been born in Guadalajara.
Guadalajara was founded in Nochistlán on January 5, having as officials Cristóbal de Oñate, Sancho Ortiz de Zúñiga and Miguel Ibarra. They worked at this project for only 16 months and created the first layout of Guadalajara.
The first news that we have regarding the natives of these lands points to the Tecuexe. These people established settlements around 1000. Later in the 12th century a new group of people moved in, these people were called Caxcan and they were from the valley in Tuitlán, which is now found in the municipality of Villanueva, Zacatecas. The Caxcan established Nochistlán by driving out the Tecuexe by force.


== Pueblo Magico ==
After its 841st anniversary of foundation, Nochistlan was named "Pueblo Mágico" or "Magic town" by the Secretary of Tourism (Mexico), Gloria Guevara Manzo. Nochistlán was the fifth town to be named "Pueblo Mágico" in the state of Zacatecas. To be nominated for this category, a town must have symbolic attributions, legends, history, significant cultural traditions, and attract tourists. Nochistlán met all of these requirements, which made it eligible to be taken into further consideration.


== Music ==
Nochistlán is known for its traditions as well as its music. It is also often referred to as, “La tierra de los músicos” or “The land of musicians”. Nochistlán has been given this nickname because within the town, there is always music playing. From Mariachi groups, to bands, as well as choirs, it is proud of their different styles of music and is not ashamed of them. In fact, Nochistlán's music is one of the main reasons tourists visit so much, aside from the beautiful architecture. In addition, it is also one of the reasons it was named, “Pueblo Mágico” because of its music. Many of the musicians that form groups come from families that were also in musical groups, which explains why Nochistlán is such a musical place.

During these eight days, everyone walking in the plaza has their face covered with flour, and crack colored eggs filled with confetti on their heads. They also throw oranges, These actions symbolize what was going on during the war between the Natives and Spanish.
