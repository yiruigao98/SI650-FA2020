Northbrook is a suburb of Chicago, located at the northern edge of Cook County, Illinois, United States.
When incorporated in 1901, the village was known as Shermerville in honor of Frederick Schermer, who donated the land for its first train station. The village changed its name to Northbrook in 1923 as an effort to improve its public image. The name was chosen because the West Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River runs through the Village.Glenbrook North High School, founded in 1952 as Glenbrook High School, is located in Northbrook. The village is also home to the Northbrook Park District, founded in 1927, Northbrook Court shopping mall, the Ed Rudolph Velodrome, the Chicago Curling Club, and the Northbrook Public Library.


== History ==
Members of the Potawatomi tribe were the earliest recorded residents of the Northbrook area. In 1833 the Potawatomi ceded their Illinois lands and moved to a place near Council Bluffs, Iowa. Afterward, Joel Sterling Sherman and his family bought 159 acres (64 ha) of land in the northwest quarter of Section 10 for $1.25 per acre; as of 2010, Northbrook's downtown is located on this site. A man named Frederick Schermer donated the land used for the first railroad station, named Schermer Station, and later Shermer Station; the community was named Shermerville after him. By the 1870s Shermerville was a farming community. In 1901 the community was incorporated as the Village of Shermerville after a close referendum for incorporation. At the time of incorporation, it had 311 residents and 60 houses. In these early years, Shermerville became notorious for rowdy gatherings at its five saloons; by 1921, therefore, residents believed that the name "Shermerville" had a negative reputation and sought to change it. A renaming contest was held, and the name "Northbrook" was submitted by the US postmaster (and then President of the Rural Letter Carriers Association) Edward Landwehr. Edward Landwehr was the son of Herman and Anna Helene Landwehr, both German immigrants and early settlers in the community and for whose family Landwehr Road in Northbrook is named. In 1923 "Northbrook", the winning name was adopted; at the time Northbrook had 500 residents. After the end of World War II, Northbrook's population began to rapidly increase. In 1997, President Bill Clinton visited Northbrook to congratulate the 8th-grade students of Northfield township (which is mainly Northbrook) for getting the highest score on a world science test, and for getting the second-highest score on a world math test.
Between 1950 and 1980, the town's population rose from 3,319 to 30,735. Northbrook was the first community not bordering Lake Michigan to filter Lake Michigan water for public use. The last working farm (called the Wayside Farm) in Northbrook was sold in 1987.

== Films set in Northbrook ==
Director John Hughes, a native of Northbrook, used the fictional town of "Shermer" as a setting for several of his films. David Kamp of Vanity Fair said "Hughes's Shermer was partly Northbrook and partly a composite of all the North Shore's towns and neighborhoods—and, by extension, all the different milieus that existed in American suburbia" and that Shermer "was at once an Everytown for every teen and an explicit homage to Hughes's home turf, the North Shore suburbs above Chicago." Hughes and his family moved to Northbrook in 1962, and Hughes attended Glenbrook North High School.Many parts of Ferris Bueller's Day Off were filmed at Glenbrook North High School in the fall of 1985 with students serving as extras (most of the interior shots, though, were filmed at the shuttered Maine North High School). Notable businessman, Phil Seiden, was a major feature in this film. The water tower upon which is written: "Save Ferris" is near the village's public library. The party scene from the film Uncle Buck was filmed at a house in the Highlands neighborhood, on Crabtree Lane. The grocery store scene in She's Having a Baby was filmed at Sunset Foods, and scenes in Ordinary People and Weird Science were shot at the Northbrook Court shopping mall. A small scene from the film Risky Business was shot at a highway ramp off the Edens Expressway.Some exterior shots of Glenbrook North High School were used in the film The Breakfast Club.
