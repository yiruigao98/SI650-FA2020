The Novovoronezh nuclear power station (Russian: Нововоронежская АЭС [pronunciation ]) is a nuclear power station close to Novovoronezh in Voronezh Oblast, central Russia.  The site was vital to the development of the VVER design; every unit built was essentially a prototype of its design. On this site is built the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II.


== History ==
In 2002 Novovoronezh-3 was modernised and life extended, including new safety systems.In 2010 Novovoronezh-5 was shut down for modernization to extend its operating life for an additional 25 years, the first VVER-1000 to undergo such an operating life extension. The works include the modernization of management, protection and emergency systems, and improvement of security and radiation safety systems.As of 2018 unit 4 is undergoing modernisation work for a 15-year life extension, taking its operational life to 60 years. This involved annealing its reactor pressure vessel and using parts from the recently shutdown unit 3.
