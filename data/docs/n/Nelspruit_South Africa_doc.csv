== History ==
Mbombela was founded as Nelspruit in 1895 by three brothers of the Nel family who grazed their cattle around the site during the winter months. During the Boer War, it served briefly as the seat of government for the South African Republic (not to be confused with the Republic of South Africa), an independent Boer republic.
The settlement was a key stopover for the Eastern railway built by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company in the late 19th century which ran from the newly discovered Witwatersrand goldfields to Delagoa Bay (modern day Maputo) in Portuguese East Africa (modern day Mozambique).
The discovery of gold in the region at places like Pilgrim's Rest and Barberton, Mpumalanga further encouraged development.
Mbombela and the surrounding area contain San rock art.


=== Name change ===
In October 2009, the South African government renamed the city "Mbombela"  the same name as the local municipality of which it is part. The Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism (LCBT) approached the High Court of South Africa as a result of this name change.

In May 2014, the North Gauteng High Court approved the name change and decided that the name Mbombela stays.
