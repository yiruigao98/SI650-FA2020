Nyandoma was founded in 1896 as a settlement around the railway station Nyandoma on the newly constructed railway between Vologda and Arkhangelsk. The railway traffic was open in 1898.  At the time, Nyandoma was a part of Kargopolsky Uyezd of Olonets Governorate. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, the governorates merged into Northern Krai, and Nyandomsky District was established among others. It became a part of Nyandoma Okrug, one of the five in Northern Krai. Nyandoma served as the administrative center of Nyandoma Okrug. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast, with Nyandoma being transferred to Arkhangelsk Oblast. The settlement was granted town status in 1939.
