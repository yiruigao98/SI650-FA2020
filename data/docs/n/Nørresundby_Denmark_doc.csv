== History ==
In 1865 a pontoon bridge by the name of Christian IX´s pontoon bridge was built. Six years later in 1871 a railroad bridge was built, which still stands today. In 1933 the pontoon bridge was removed and a new bridge, called the Limfjords bridge (Limfjordsbroen), was built in its place.  Five years later on 29 May 1938 Aalborg Airport opened. 
Through 1958-1960 the Limfjords bridge was expanded and in 1969 the Limfjords tunnel (Limfjordstunnelen) east of Nørresundby was opened. As a supplement to these bridges and the railway bridge, there have for several years been spoken about adding a fourth connection over the Limfjord although no direct action have been taken.
