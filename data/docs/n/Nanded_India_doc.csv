== Etymology ==
From a copper plate inscription found at Washim, a town approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of Nanded, archaeologists deduce the city was formerly known as Nanditaṭa (Marathi: नंदितट). Another name was Nandigrāma. Folklore suggests that the name "Nanded" developed from Nandi the Vahana of Shiva. Shiva was said to have performed penance on the banks (Taṭa) of the Godavari river. This "Nandi-taṭa" later became "Nanded".
