== Origin of name ==
The name Nakodar, according to one account, is a said to be derived from the Persian words Neki ka dar, which mean Gate of Goodness or Virtue and it was named so by the Persian Kambohs. According to another version, the town was so-named after Nikudari legion of the Mongols.


== History ==

The town is of considerable antiquity and had been held in succession by three different races, the Arain, Jatts, Kambojs, and then by the muslim Rajputs, traces of whom still exist in the extensive ruins by which the town is surrounded. The town was anciently founded by the Hindu Kamboh, according to Sir William Wilson Hunter and others. The Kamboh settlements lay to the west of present town and the sites are still marked by extensive ruins and two old fine tombs, now called the Black and Red Domes, from the color of the material. Tradition attributes the Kamboh expulsion to the Nawab Kutb Khan who came with an army from Indor near Nuh in 1570 AD. As a consequence, the lordship of the town thus passed over to the Khanzadaas from the Kamboj tribe. Within two generations, the Rajputs got the town in jagir from Emperor Jahangir, in later sixteenth century, apparently divesting the Khanzadahs, the successor race to the Kambohs. The Rajputs were themselves later ousted during Sikh period by one Sardar Tara Singh Ghaiba who made a fort and made himself the master of the surroundings. From Ghaiba, the town was seized by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1816.
