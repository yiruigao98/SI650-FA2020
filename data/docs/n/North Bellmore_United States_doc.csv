== History ==
In 1643, Bellmore was a farming and fishing town know then as "Little Neck and "New Bridge". Bellmore was settled primarily by Englishmen who crossed Long Island Sound from Connecticut in the middle of the seventeenth century. Preston Bowman purchased a 214-acre (0.9 km2) farm in what is now North Bellmore in 1655. Further south, near the bay, John Smith deeded 100 acres (0.4 km2) to his son, Jeremiah in 1676. John Bedell married Sarah Southard and moved into their new home on Merrick Road in about 1689. Two communities grew out of these beginnings. Smithville (later Smithville South) was named for the many Smith families who lived in the area, and New Bridge, named for the bridge that joined the peninsulas south of Merrick Road.
When the railroad was built through the area in 1867 they arbitrarily named their station Bellmore. Development followed as both communities grew towards the railroad and adopted the name Bellmore. By 1920, the Bellmores had a population of 3000 as well as stores along Bedford Avenue. The town was officially named Bellmore in 1900, when the post office was established.The Bellmore Memorial Library, was founded in 1948. It was started in an old schoolhouse. This library has lasted since 1948 until present, keeping it as the main library of Bellmore, NY.
In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled against Sam's Stationery and Luncheonette of Bellmore.  In Ginsberg v. New York, the Court found that it was well within the state's power to protect minors and that just because the material is not classified as obscene to adults it may still be regulated with minors.


== Schools ==
The city is home to the annual Mathematical Olympiads for Elementary and Middle Schools, a prestigious school math competition in the United States.

This is one of the four central districts of New York. For two years, North Bellmore and Bellmore students are combined in Grand Avenue. After, Bellmore students go to Kennedy, and North Bellmore students to Mepham. However, this may vary depending on zoning. The administrative offices for the Bellmore Public Schools are located in Winthrop Avenue, while the administrative offices for North Bellmore are in Martin Avenue. Brookside School, in North Merrick, is the home of the Bellmore-Merrick Central-High School District's offices, as well as the alternative school.


=== Education ===
The North Bellmore students go to the schools that they are zoned for. However, Bellmore students in the same grade all go to the same school, as each grade level is in one of the three schools and not all. All Bellmore and North Bellmore Students go to Grand Avenue along with a few North Merrick Students who attended Park Avenue Elementary School, and then they split and go to their zoned school in the Central High School District. However, students not zoned for Calhoun may go to that school if they have a special interest in the arts. Students interested in attending Calhoun for the arts must audition.
