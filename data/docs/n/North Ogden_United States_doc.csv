== History ==

Originally named Fort Buenaventura, Ogden was the first permanent settlement by people of European descent in what is now Utah. It was established by the trapper Miles Goodyear in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden sits today.
In November 1847, Captain James Brown purchased all the land now comprising Weber County together with some livestock and Fort Buenaventura for $3,000 (equivalent to $82000 in 2019). The land was conveyed to Captain Brown in a Mexican Land Grant, this area being at that time a part of Mexico.The settlement was then called Brownsville, after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the Hudson's Bay Company, Peter Skene Ogden, who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. There is some confusion about which "Ogden" was the first to set foot in the area. A Samuel Ogden traveled though the western United States on an exploration trip in 1818. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park.

Ogden is the closest sizable city to the Golden Spike location at Promontory Summit, Utah, where the First Transcontinental Railroad was joined in 1869. It was known as a major passenger railroad junction owing to its location along major east–west and north–south routes, prompting the local chamber of commerce to adopt the motto, "You can't get anywhere without coming to Ogden." Railroad passengers traveling west to San Francisco from the eastern United States typically passed through Ogden (and not through the larger Salt Lake City to the south). However, Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, no longer serves Ogden. Passengers who want to travel to and from Ogden by rail must travel via FrontRunner commuter rail to Salt Lake City and Provo.
In 1972, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints completed construction of and dedicated the Ogden Utah Temple in Ogden. The temple was built to serve the area's large LDS population. In 2010, the LDS Church announced they would renovate the Ogden Temple and the adjacent Tabernacle. The work which began in 2011 includes an update to the exterior, the removal of the Tabernacle's steeple to make the Temple's steeple a main focus and a new underground parking garage and gardens.  The Temple was rededicated in 2014.Because Ogden has historically been Utah's second largest city, it is home to a large number of historic buildings. However, by the 1980s, several Salt Lake City suburbs and Provo had surpassed Ogden in population.
The Defense Depot Ogden Utah operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997. Some of its 1,128 acres (456 ha) have been converted into a commercial and industrial park called the Business Depot Ogden.


== Geography ==


=== Topography ===
Ogden is located at 41°13′11″N 111°58′16″W (41.2196, −111.9712), at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains. This is at about the same latitude as Benevent in Campania in southern Italy.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 26.6 square miles (69.0 km2), all land.  Elevations in the city range from about 4,300 to 5,000 feet (1,300 to 1,500 m) above sea level.

The Ogden and Weber Rivers, which originate in the mountains to the east, flow through the city and meet at a confluence just west of the city limits. Pineview Dam is in the Ogden River Canyon 7 miles (11 km) east of Ogden. The reservoir behind the dam provides over 110,000 acre feet (140,000,000 m3) of water storage and water recreation for the area.
Prominent mountain peaks near Ogden include Mount Ogden to the east and Ben Lomond to the north.


=== Streetscape ===

From south to west to north, Ogden's neighboring towns are South Ogden, Roy, West Haven, Marriott-Slaterville, Farr West, Pleasant View and North Ogden. The city is - like many others in the USA - characterized by a spacious, street grid with many blocks. The streets are numbered from north to south, which is expressed in the corresponding street names. As in Salt Lake City, counting begins at the center of the LDS church. By extending the numbers with directions ("E" for east and "W" for west) their relative relation to the central point is made clear. In the center of the city, the blocks from Union Station along 25th Street, the west-to-east oriented cross streets are named after former U.S. presidents such as Lincoln Avenue, Grant Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Adam Avenue, Jefferson Avenue or Madison Avenue. The central connecting street in north–south orientation is Harrison-Boulevard. The city area is divided into six districts: in the North End, including West Ogden, Downtown and East Central, in the East, including East Bench and Shadow Valley.


=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Ogden experiences either an oceanic climate (Cfb) or a humid continental climate (Dfb) depending on which variant of the system is used. Summers are hot and relatively dry, with highs frequently reaching 95 °F (35 °C), with a few days per year reaching 100 °F (38 °C). Rain is provided in the form of infrequent thunderstorms during summer, usually between late July and mid-September during the height of monsoon season. The Pacific storm season usually lasts from about October through May, with precipitation reaching its peak in spring. Snow usually first occurs in late October or early November, with the last occurring sometime in April. Winters are cool and snowy, with highs averaging 37 °F (3 °C) in January. Snowfall averages about 56 inches (140 cm), with approximately 21.98 inches (558 mm) of precipitation annually. Extremes range from −16 °F (−27 °C), set on January 26, 1949, to 106 °F (41 °C), set on July 14, 2002.

== Government and politics ==

Ogden is governed under the mayor-council form of government, in which the full-time mayor serves as executive while the seven-member part-time council serves as the legislative branch. All these elected officials serve four-year terms, with elections occurring in odd-numbered years and terms beginning in January of even-numbered years.
The mayor is Mike Caldwell, who took office in January 2012. The city council members are Marcia White, Richard Hyer, Bart Blair, Ben Nadolski, Luis Lopez, Angela Choberka, and Doug Stephens. Four of the council members represent the city's four municipal districts, while the other three (Lopez, White, and Blair) are elected at-large by voters from the entire city.
The Ogden City government operates on a budget of $190 million per year and employs nearly 600 full-time workers. In addition to providing the usual municipal services, the government promotes business and economic development. The city operates a redevelopment agency (RDA), with the city council acting as the RDA governing board and the mayor as its executive director. The RDA's activity has increased since its establishment in 1969, with tax increment revenues at about $10 million per year and an outstanding debt of over $50 million. Designated redevelopment districts now cover nearly all of Ogden's central business districts, as are Business Depot Ogden and several other industrial areas in the western parts of the city.
Much of the recent political discourse in Ogden has focused on controversial government-sponsored development projects in the downtown area, including the Ogden Eccles Conference Center, Lindquist Field, The Junction, the Ogden River Project, and other proposals that have not moved forward.  A proposed streetcar connecting downtown to Weber State University has attracted considerable attention but only limited support.  A major controversy flared up in 2005–07 when the mayor and many others pushed unsuccessfully for construction of a luxury residential development on public land in Ogden's foothills and a new ski resort in the mountains above the city, to be accessed by a pair of aerial gondolas. Other local political concerns include Ogden's relatively high tax and utility rates, efforts to fight crime, allegations of government corruption, and challenges facing the Ogden City schools.

I-15 runs north–south near the city's western edge and provides connections to the rest of the Wasatch Front and beyond. Ogden is served directly by exits 341, 342, 343, and 344. US-89 enters the city from the south, running through the city as Washington Boulevard, which serves as the main street of Ogden. It then continues north to Brigham City.
