== History ==

The history of Novopolotsk dates back to the year of 1958, when a large number of enthusiasts, workers and builders, seeking new experiences and romantic feelings came here to establish a new town. There was reason for that: a big oil refinery plant was to be set up. When new factories were being built, they were placed far enough away from Polotsk so that the radiation and dangerous gases would not reach the city. However, it was later decided that it would be acceptable to build a few buildings closer to the factories for the workers to live in. With them came a hospital, a fire station, and a school. A few more buildings were built and the city of Novopolotsk was born.
The city now has 12 secondary schools and 2 gymnasiums, many kindergartens and the two subsidiary of Polotsk State University.
