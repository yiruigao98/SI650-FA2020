Nehtaur is a city in Bijnor district in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Nehtaur is an ancient and well known town because of its culture and educational backgrounds. Nehtaur Town was established by the Taga Minister family of Ajmer state when they came from Ranthambhor,Rajasthan after it was captured by Kutubuddin Aibak and the place was called Nai+thour = NEHTAUR (New Abode). This is how Nehtaur derived its name[Ref.Book-History of Islam in India].
During the British period also, Tyagi/Taga (called Chaudghary, Hindu & Muslim) & Syed were the main Jageerdar (estate) and Nehtaur became upper class community hub. Syed and Tyagi dominated town and both community hold the entire economy. During that time, Nehtaur was very famous town in the state because of its higher educational status and its many people were graduates. Its Sanskrit pathshalas and Arabic madrasas were famous in the region [1]

== Syeds of Nehtaur ==
Most of the Syeds of Nehtaur are descendants of Syed Kamaluddin Tirmizi, who migrated to India in 587 AH/1191 AD for preaching Islam in the Subcontinent, as had many other Aulias done at that time, such as Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti Gharibnawaz Aulia. At that time, Shahabuddin Ghouri was preparing for his First raid on India. When Shahabuddin learnt about Kamaluddin Tirmizi's, plans of also going to India, he offered him to travel under his protection. Kamaluddin Tirmizi, however declined the offer, saying that "Our missions are different. You are going there to conquer land; and my intentions are to propagate the teaching of Islam to the inhabitants". Kamaluddin Tirmizi, however directed one of his eleven sons, Mir Malik Syed Ibrahim Shah to join Shahabuddin Ghori. Shahabuddin Ghori was defeated by the then ruler of Delhi, Prithivi Raj Chauhan. Although his forces captured the Hansi Fort (100 miles West of Panipat and about 130 miles West of Delhi on Delhi-Hisar-Sirsa Road), however Mir Malik Syed Ibrahim Shah attained Shahadat, and was buried within the Fort premises (South West area), where, reportedly, it still exists and is known as Nishanchi's Mazar. Shahabuddin again returned to India in 1192 after preparing for one year and defeated Prithivi Raj Chauhan in the second battle of Tarain and, subsequently, became the first Muslim ruler to conquer Delhi and establish a Muslim rule in India. He was very happy to find Kamaluddin well settled and in his honour gave him land in Sialgarh in Karnal. Subsequently, Kamaluddin Tirmizi settled down in Kaithal, where he is buried. Most sons of Kamaluddin spread themselves throughout the length and breadth if India on preaching mission, as follows:

Suitable individuals were awarded land – usually consisting of a number of villages – and they were required provide a designated number of fully equipped soldiers – usually under the individual's command – whenever the King required.

He was buried in Doaba, Allahbad. His mazar is known as Mazar-e-Haya Shaheed, where, reportedly, people bring their sick, particularly children for healing and return satisfied.
