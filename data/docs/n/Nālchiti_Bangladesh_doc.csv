The 1950 riots (Bengali: পঞ্চাশের গণহত্যা) refers to the massacre of Bengali Hindus by the Bengali Muslims, the Pakistani police and the para-military accompanied by arson.


== Background ==
In August 1947, the erstwhile British India was partitioned into the Dominions of India and Pakistan on the basis of religion. Pakistan was to become the homeland for the Muslims of former British India with a majority Muslim population. The province of Bengal with a marginal Muslim majority was also partitioned with the Muslim majority East Bengal going to Pakistan and Hindu majority West Bengal going to India. The Sylhet district of Assam was added to East Bengal after the Sylhet Referendum where the majority voted for Pakistan. According to the 1941 census, East Bengal had 28% non-Muslim population, the majority of them being Bengali Hindus. West Bengal has a 30.2% Muslim population, the rest were Hindus.
The area comprising East Bengal, especially the Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions had been witness to numerous instances of ethnic violence in the decades preceding the Partition. In the 1940s, the frequency and intensity of the riots increased as the movement for Pakistan gained momentum. In the last quarter of 1946, the Bengali Hindus of Noakhali and Tippera districts were subjected to a series of massacres, loot, arson, rape, abduction and forced conversion to Islam, which came to be known as the Noakhali riots.
Within a month after the Partition, the Janmashtami procession was attacked in Dhaka. In 1948, the Dhamrai rathyatra and the Janmashtami procession was not allowed to be held. In 1949, there were posters all over Dhaka against the Durga Puja. The number of community pujas got drastically reduced. On the day of Vijayadashami hundreds of Hindu households were set on fire rendering around 750 Hindu families homeless. Santosh Chatterjee, a Press Trust of India (PTI) correspondent was imprisoned on 25 November 1949 without any charges and released after a month.


== Atrocities (Aug 1949 - Jan 1950) ==
In August 1949, atrocities on non-Muslims began all over East Pakistan and continued for three months. In August, Muslim mobs along with the police and the Ansars attacked some Hindu villages in Beanibazar and Barlekha police station areas of Sylhet District. Houses were looted, destroyed and set on fire. Hindu villagers were assaulted and murdered. Hindu women were raped by the policemen. Soon after the Hindus were attacked in the village of Bhandaria in Barisal District. In Rajshahi District, Father Thomas Cattaneo reported that the Santhal villages were attacked, Santhal villagers were arrested and Santhal women were raped. On 10 December, a Muslim mob attacked the Puthia Rajbari Palace in Rajshahi Division and forcibly took possession of the house and its treasures.


=== Kalshira massacre ===
On 20 December 1949, four police constables raided the house of one Joydev Brahma in the village of Kalshira under Mollahat police station in Bagerhat sub-division in the district of Khulna, in search of some suspected communists, late in the night. Failed to find any suspects the constables tried to rape the wife of Brahma. Her cry alerted him and his companions, who in a desperate bid to save her attacked two constables, one of whom died on the spot. The remaining two raised an alarm and the neighbouring people came to their rescue. On the next day, the District Superintendent of Police arrived in Kalshira accompanied by armed police contingent and the Ansars and attacked Kalshira and other neighbouring Hindu villages mercilessly. They encouraged Muslims from neighbouring villages to loot the Hindu properties. A number of Hindus were killed, men and women were forcibly converted. Images were broken and shrines were desecrated. All the 350 homesteads in the village, except three, were demolished. The cattle and boats were forcibly taken away. Within a month of the massacre 30,000 Hindus fled from Khulna to India.


=== Nachole massacre ===
Nachole was a police station in the Nawabganj sub-division of Rajshahi district. During the Partition of India, the entire Nawabganj sub-division was transferred from Malda district which went to India to Rajshahi district that fell in Pakistan. The area under Nachole police station was non-Muslim majority. It was inhabited by Santals and Bengali Hindu castes like the Kshatriyas, Bhuindas and Kaibartas. After the Partition, the Tebhaga Movement was brutally suppressed in the newly formed state of Pakistan. However, in Nachole the movement was still alive through the covert activities of the leadership operating from underground. From the autumn of 1949 the leaders began to succeed in implementing the Tebhaga principles through persuasion, coercion and in some cases force.
On 5 January 1950, five policemen from the Nachole police station were killed by the Santals in Chandipur village after they opened fire to disperse the villagers who had gathered to protest the arrest of one of the villagers. The Government of Pakistan responded to this incident by sending a 2,000 strong army contingent along with the police and the East Pakistan Ansars on 7 January. They set fire to twelve villages, ransacked the huts and killed many villagers on their way to Chandipur. In Chandipur, they tortured the men, raped the women and set fire to the dwellings. Hundreds of Santals and Hindus were killed. At Rohanpur, Ila Mitra, one of the leaders of the movement was arrested with hundreds of peasants.
