== Geography ==
Neu Wulmstorf is situated between Hamburg in the east, the marsh of the Altes Land in the north, the forest of the Harburg Hills (Harburger Berge) in the south east, Buchholz in der Nordheide and the geest to the south, and Buxtehude to the west. The municipality incorporates eleven villages and most of the area marks the north north west outskirts of the larger natural region of the Lüneburg Heath in North Germany.

 The landscape is dominated by the transition from the marsh in the north to the geest in south east. On the marsh side lies the village of Rübke in the Lower Saxon Elbe marshes at sea level and the nature reserve (Naturschutzgebiet) Moore bei Buxtehude (mire), which is home to the corn crake.
The town of Neu Wulmstorf sits right on the transitions from the mire up to the geest.
Further up, the villages Wulmstorf, Daerstorf, Schwiederstorf, Rade are marking the highest elevations of Neu Wulmstorf on the western outskirts of the Harburg Hills.
The villages of Ardestorf, Elstorf, Bachheide, Rade, Mienenbüttel and Ohlenbüttel lie on a stretch reaching from the north east to the south end of the municipality.

== Infrastructure ==
The relatively young town of Neu Wulmstorf grew at the intersection of two old trails. The main road connecting Rübke in the marsh with the geest villages of Wulmstorf and Elstorf intersects with the Bundesstraße 73 as the main road connecting Stade and Cuxhaven with Hamburg. It dominates the town as it cuts through from east to west. Just before the geest, the Lower Elbe Railway marked the north border of the Neu Wulmstorf village for many years, with the Neu Wulmstorf S-Bahn station. The station bore the name Daerstorf before that village including the exclave on which the station was built upon, got incorporated into Neu Wulmstorf.
Another axis is the connection from Buxtehude to Buchholz. The first stretch of the Bundesstraße 3, intersects with the Bundesautobahn 1 at the south tip of the municipality.
