In 1949 a line was built to link the Tanganyika groundnut scheme plantations around Nachingwea with the port of Mtwara.  The scheme famously foundered and the railway was abandoned in 1962.  Proposals have been made for a new railway to link Mtwara to iron ore deposits in the west, perhaps linking via Songea to Liganga.

== Gauge ==

1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) and 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) are too close to allow 3-rail dual gauge; you have to have 4-rail dual gauge.  But if you have 4-rail gauge, then you can include 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) gauge (standard gauge) at the cost of slightly longer sleepers.


== Container port ==
The container port at Dar es Salaam is served by both 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) and 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) railway gauge tracks.
