== History ==
The history of Noble Park as a suburb in Melbourne began in 1909. Allan Buckley nicknamed the land subdivision Nobel Park after the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Buckley had used the estate to demonstrate Nobel's explosives but the name was soon transformed to Noble Park by common usage. Early settlement was encouraged by building a community centre, church, school, postal centre and later, a railway station. The postal centre was opened in August 1910 and the railway station was completed in July 1912. In the early days, growth was relatively slow due to the lack of population growth in the area. In the early 1920s, the Railway Department set up a poultry farm and eventually a plant nursery was set up in the eastern part of the suburb. The focus of the small community was based around its local town hall. In the 1980s Noble Park became known for its infamous gangs that carried out violent crimes against the community as well as the scene of a major shoot out between members of the Victorian Police and Pavel Marinof, a burglar on the run. Residential growth in the second half of the century saw an end to the grazing paddocks and market gardens. By the 1990s, 56% of Noble Park’s population was born overseas, with the largest being from Great Britain and Ireland), followed by Bosnians, Italians and Greeks); and South and South East Asians (including Indians, Sri Lankans and Vietnamese), according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In recent years there has been an upsurge of migrants and refugees settled from North African countries, especially Sudan.
