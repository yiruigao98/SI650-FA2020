Historically, the city was known as Campos de Congonhas, Congonhas de Sabará and until 1923 as Villa Nova de Lima.

The city is home to several mines, including the Morro Velho, Mostardas, and Rio de Peixe mines. A number of minerals are extracted from these and other sites in and around the city, including gold.
The St. John Del Rey Mining Company was founded by British interests in 1834 for the extraction of gold and also caused the settlement of some 150 families from Britain which led to the establishment of the Anglican Church in town.
