= History =
Nilakottai palayam was one of the 26 palayam in Dindigul province. The founder of Nilakottai Kulappa Nayajar came from Vijayanagaram in the year of 1366 A.D before the period of Vishwanatha Nayak.


== Kulappa Nayak ==
Nilakottai was a very fine palayam, consisting mainly of arable lands. For his military help to the emperor of Vijayanagar in repelling an invasion, Makkala Nayaka, of the Kambala caste, was rewarded with lands west of Madura where, with the Krishna Devaraya Raya's permission, he built the mud fort of Nilakkottai in 1366 A.D. He ruled for 12 years and was succeeded by his son Kulappa Nayaka.Along with the Pandya King Chandra Sekara of Madura, Kulappa was dispossessed by a Chola Prince named Veera Sekara Chozha, and both defeated rulers appealed to the Krishna Deva Raya for help. Krishna Deva Raya sent Kotikam Nagama Nayakar to his aid. Nagama Nayakka suppressed the Chozha ruler and took Madurai,but suddenly he threw off his allegiance  and declining to help the Pandya king, usurped the throne . The Vijaya Nagar Emperor demanded that someone  cure the defection. Nagama's own son Viswanaha volunteered. He overthrew his father and handed him over to the emperor. As a reward for his loyalty the emperor appointed Viswanha as the governor of Madurai.When Vishwa Natha Nayakka ruled Tamil Nadu Kulappa Nayakkar helped him in many wars with his troops. For example,when Pandiya was giving trouble to Madurai country,Kulappa Nayakkar controlled their revolt with his troops.
After Vishwanatha Nayak, Madurai was ruled by Krishappa nayakkar(1554–72).


== Under British Rule ==
There is not enough rain for agriculture in Nilakotttai so Kulappa Nayakar could not pay his tribute to British government. Conflict came to a head in 1797 when, after sending his family to Dobinayanakanur, the Polegar gathered forces in Kallarnadu, joined the revolt, and tried unsuccessfully to expel the British garrison from his fort.
