Namco Limited was a Japanese multinational video game developer and publisher headquartered in Ōta, Tokyo. It held several international branches, including Namco America in Santa Clara, California, Namco Europe in London, Namco Taiwan in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and Shanghai Namco in mainland China.
Namco was founded by Masaya Nakamura on June 1, 1955, as Nakamura Seisakusho, beginning as a producer and distributor of coin-operated amusement rides. After reorganizing to Nakamura Manufacturing Company in 1959, a partnership with Walt Disney Productions provided the company with the resources to expand its operations. It entered the video game industry after acquiring the struggling Japanese division of Atari in 1974, distributing games such as Breakout in Japan. The company renamed itself to Namco in 1977 and published Gee Bee, its first original video game, a year later. Namco's first major hit was the fixed shooter Galaxian in 1979. It was followed by Pac-Man in 1980, the best-selling arcade game of all time. Namco prospered during the golden age of arcade video games in the early 1980s, releasing popular titles such as Galaga, Xevious, and Pole Position.
Namco entered the home console market in 1984 with conversions of its arcade games for the Nintendo Family Computer. Its American division acquired a stake in Atari Games in 1985, before selling it in 1987 due to disagreements between the two companies. Arguments over licensing contracts with Nintendo lead Namco to producing games for competing platforms, such as the Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, and PlayStation. The company continued its success with games such as Ridge Racer, Tekken, and Taiko no Tatsujin. Namco endured numerous financial difficulties in the late 1990s and 2000s as a result of the struggling Japanese economy and diminishing arcade market. In 2005, Namco merged with Bandai to form Namco Bandai Holdings, a Japanese entertainment conglomerate. It continued producing games until it was merged into Namco Bandai Games in 2006.
Namco produced several multi-million-selling game franchises, such as Pac-Man, Galaxian, Tekken, and Ridge Racer. It operated video arcades and amusement parks globally, and also produced films, toys, cafe chains, and arcade cabinets. Namco is remembered for its unique corporate model, its importance to the industry, and its advancements in technology. Its successor, Bandai Namco Entertainment, continues to use the Namco brand for its video arcades and other entertainment products.


== History ==


=== Origins and acquisition of Atari Japan (1955–1977) ===

On June 1, 1955, Japanese businessman Masaya Nakamura founded Nakamura Seisakusho Co., Ltd. in Ikegami, Tokyo. The son of a shotgun repair business owner, the struggling post-World War II economy in Japan made him unable to find work. Nakamura established his own company after his father's business saw success with producing pop cork guns. Beginning with only US$1,2000, Nakamura spent the money on two hand-cranked rocking horses that he installed on the roof garden of a Matsuya department store in Yokohama. The horses were loved by children and turned a decent profit for Nakamura, who began designing other kinds of amusement games such as goldfish scoopers and picture viewing machines. The business underwent a reorganization in 1959, when it changed its name to Nakamura Manufacturing Company. Noticing Nakamura's successful business, the Mitsukoshi department store chain approached him with the idea of designing a children's ride for the roof of its store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. He designed a moving train named Roadaway Race, which was a hit and lead to Mitsuokishi requesting similar rides for all of its stores.Along with Taito, Rosen Enterprises, and Nihon Goraku Bussan, the Nakamura Manufacturing Company became one of Japan's leading amusement companies. When Roadaway Race proved successful, it began work on other mechanical games at a similar scale. The first of these was Torpedo Launcher, a submarine warfare shooting gallery later titled Periscope. While its games sold well, Nakamura Manufacturing lacked the manufacturing lines and distribution networks that its competitors had, which made the production of games longer and expensive. Because other manufacturers had exclusive rights to do so, the company was unable to place its games inside stores. Nakamura Manufacturing opened its own production plant in 1967, moving its corporate office to a four-story building in Osaka. The company secured a deal with Walt Disney Productions to produce children's rides in the likenesses of its characters, a move that allowed the business to expand its operations and become a driving force in the Japanese coin-op market. Its other products included Ultraman-themed gun games and pinball tables branded with Osomatsu-kun characters.

In 1970, Nakamura Manufacturing released its first arcade game, a driving game titled Racer. The name Namco, an abbreviation of Nakamura Manufacturing Company, was inducted in 1971 as a brand for several of its machines. The company grew to having ten employees, which included Nakamura himself. It established a partnership with Kansei Seiki Seisakusho (Kasko), one of the largest amusement game providers in Japan; Nakamura Manufacturing was given the rights to distribute several of Kasco's games to other parts of the country. It saw continued success with its arcade games, which had become commonplace in bowling allies and grocery stores. A deal with Honda was secured to produce a motion-based ride based on its Dax line of minibikes. The company also established a robotics division to produce robots for entertainment centers and festivals, such as those that distributed pamphlets, ribbon making machines, and a robot named Putan that solved pre-built mazes.In August 1973, American game company Atari began establishing a series of divisions in Asia, one of which was named Atari Japan. Its president, Tanashi Takumi, approached Nakamura in early 1974 in regards to having his business become the distributor of Atari games across Japan. Nakamura, already planning global expansion following his company’s success, agreed to the deal. However, in part due to employee theft, Atari Japan was a financial disaster and nearly collapsed in its first few years of operation. When Takumi stopped showing up to work, the company was handed to Hideyuki Nakajima, a former employee of the Japan Art Paper Company. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, whose company was already struggling in America, chose to sell the Japanese division. His fixer, Ron Gordon, was given the task of finding the buyer for Atari Japan. After being turned down by Sega and Taito, Gordon’s offer was accepted by Nakamura for US$1.18 million. However, Nakamura informed Bushnell his company was unable to pay the money by the deadline; with no other takers for Atari Japan, Bushnell ultimately allowed Nakamura to only pay $550,000 and then $250,000 a year for three years. The acquisition allowed Nakamura Manufacturing to distribute Atari games across Japan, and made it the country's sixth-largest video game company by revenue.The Atari Japan purchase was not an immediate success, in part due to the medal game fad of the 1970s. While Nakamura Manufacturing saw some success with imports such as Kee Games's Tank, the Japanese video game industry's decrease in popularity did not make them as profitable as hoped. The market become more viable once restrictions on medal games were imposed by the Japanese government in 1976, as Nakamura Manufacturing began returning higher profits; its import of Atari's Breakout was so successful that it lead to rampant piracy in the industry. By the end of the year, Nakamura Manufacturing was one of Japan's leading video game companies.


=== Galaxian, Pac-Man, and arcade success (1977–1984) ===
Nakamura Manufacturing changed its corporate name to Namco in June 1977. It opened a division in Hong Kong named Namco Enterprises Asia, which maintained video arcades and amusement centers. As Namco's presence in Japan was steadily rising, Nakajima suggested to Nakamura that he open a division in the United States to increase worldwide brand awareness. Nakamura agreed to the proposal, and on September 1, 1978, established Namco America in Sunnyvale, California. With Nakajima as its vice president, Namco America's aim was to import games and license them to companies such as Atari and Bally Manufacturing. Its first import was Shoot Away, an electro-mechanical clay shooting game that proved successful in Japan.As the video game industry prospered in Japan during the 1970s with the release of Taito's Space Invaders, Namco turned its attention towards making its own video games. While its licensed Atari games were still profitable, sales were decreasing and the quality of the hardware used began deteriorating. Per the recommendation of company engineer Shigekazu Ishimura, the company retrofitted its Ōta manufacturing facility into a small game division and purchased old stock computers from NEC for employees to study. Namco released Gee Bee, its first original game, in October 1978. Designed by new hire Toru Iwatani, it is a video pinball game that incorporates elements from Breakout and similar "block breaker" clones. Gee Bee fell short of the company's sales expectations and was unable to compete with games such as Space Invaders. However, it allowed Namco to gain a stronger foothold in the video game market. In 1979, Namco published its first major hit Galaxian, one of the first video games to incorporate RGB color graphics, score bonuses, and a tilemap hardware model. Galaxian is considered historically important for these innovations and mechanics built off of those in Space Invaders. It was released outside Japan by Midway Games, the video game division of Bally, where it became one of its best-selling titles and formed a relationship between it and Namco.

The space shooter genre became ubiquitous by the end of the decade, with games such as Galaxian and Space Invaders becoming commonplace in Japanese amusement centers. As video games often depicted the killing of enemies and shooting of targets, the industry possessed a predominately male playerbase. Toru Iwatani began work on a maze video game that was targeted primarily towards women, with simplistic gameplay and recognizable characters. Alongside a team of nine others, he created a game named Puck Man, where players controlled a character that had to eat dots in an enclosed maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursued them. Iwatani based its gameplay on women eating sweets and desserts, and designed its characters with soft colors and simplistic facial features. Puck Man was test-marketed in Japan on May 22, 1980 and released in July. It was only a modest success; players were more accustom to the shooting gameplay of Galaxian as opposed to Puck Man's visually distinctive characters and gameplay style. In North America, it was released as Pac-Man in December 1980. Selling over 400,000 arcade units total, Pac-Man is the best-selling arcade game of all time. Its simplicity and design has made it a fixture in popular culture and spawned a multi-million-selling franchise.Namco regularly released several successful games throughout the early 1980s. Pitch In, an electro-mechanical softball simulator from 1980, was a considerable success in Japan. It published Galaga, the follow-up to Galaxian, in 1981 to critical acclaim, usurping its predecessor in popularity with its fast-paced action and power-ups. 1982 saw the release of Pole Position, a racing game that is the first to use a real racetrack (the Fuji Speedway) and laid the foundations for the genre itself, and Dig Dug, a maze chaser that allowed players to create their own mazes. Namco's biggest post-Pac-Man success was the vertical-scrolling shooter Xevious in 1983, designed by new-hire Masanobu Endo. Xevious's early usage of pre-rendered visuals, boss fights, and a cohesive world made it an astounding success in Japan, recording record-breaking sales figures that hadn't been seen since Space Invaders. The game's success lead to merchandise, tournament play, and the first video game soundtrack album. The same year, Namco released Mappy, an early side-scrolling platformer, and the Pole Position sequel Pole Position II. Endo went on to design The Tower of Druaga a year later, one of the first hugely successful action role-playing games. Druaga popularized the idea of note sharing and video game guidebooks, influencing games such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda. 1984 also saw the release of Pac-Land, a Pac-Man-themed platform game that paved the way for similar games such as Super Mario Bros., and Gaplus, a moderately successful update to Galaga. The success of Namco's arcade games prompted it to launch its own print publication, Namco Community Magazine NG, to allow its fans to connect with developers.


=== Success with home consoles (1984–1989) ===

By 1984, the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) became the leading video game system in Japan, having sold over 1.2 million units and outperforming its competitor, the SG-1000. The console's success generated considerable demand from consumers, who often requested for new software; at the time, the Famicom possessed 16 games, all first-party releases. As a way to curb demand, Nintendo established a licensee program that allowed third-party companies to produce games for the Famicom in exchange for a cut of the profit. As the company showed interest in developing Famicom games during its launch, Namco became one of Nintendo's first third-party developers, along with Hudson Soft. Namco was given several preferential terms for being among the first to sign on, such as the ability to produce its own cartridges.Namco established a subsidiary named Namcot in 1984 which was to act as its console game division. It released its first four titles in September: Galaxian, Pac-Man, Xevious, and Mappy. Xevious sold over 1.5 million copies and became the Famicom's first "killer app". Namco's arcade game ports were considered high-quality and helped increase sales of the console. Namcot also began releasing games for the MSX, a popular Japanese computer. Namcot was financially successful and became an important pillar within the company. When Namco moved its headquarters to Ōta, Tokyo in 1985, it used the profits generated from the Famicom conversion of Xevious to fund its construction (the building was nicknamed "Xevious" as a result). Namcot also began development of original software, such as Star Luster. The Talking Aid, a speech impairment device, was part of the company's attempts in venturing into other markets.When the North American video game crash concluded in 1985 with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Atari had effectively collapsed. After enduring numerous financial difficulties and losing its control in the industry, parent Warner Communications split the company into two entities. The first was Atari Corporation, which dealt with personal computers and video game consoles. The second was Atari Games, which produced arcade games and computer software. Commodore International founder Jack Tramiel acquired Atari Corporation while Warner struggled to find a buyer for Atari Games. Against the advice of its accountants at Price Waterhouse, Namco America purchased a 60% stake in Atari Games on February 4, 1985. The acquisition gave Namco the exclusive rights to distribute Atari games in Japan.Nakamura began losing interest and patience in Atari Games not long after the acquisition. As he started viewing Atari as a competitor to Namco, he was hesitant to pour additional funds and resources into the company. Nakamura also disliked having to share ownership with Warner Communications, fearing it could lead to him losing control of Atari Games and Namco going under. Nakajima grew frustrated with Nakamura's attempts at marketing Atari video games in Japan, and had constant disagreements with him over which direction to take the company. Viewing its acquisition as being largely unsuccessful, in 1987 Namco America sold the majority of its shares to Warner, while still retaining its right to release Atari games in Japan. The remaining portion was sold to Nakajima and a group of others;, Nakajima resigned from Namco America and became president of Atari Games. He established Tengen, a publisher that protested against Nintendo's licensing restrictions for the Nintendo Entertainment System by producing several unlicensed games. As Namco lacked a proper home console division in the United States, it gave Tengen permission to release some of its Famicom games like Pac-Man overseas.

In Japan, Namco continued to see expeditious growth. It published Pro Baseball: Family Stadium for the Famicom, which was critically acclaimed and sold over 2.5 million copies. Its sequel, Pro Baseball: Family Stadium '87, sold an additional two million. In 1986, Namco entered the restaurant industry by acquiring the Italian Tomato cafe chain. It also released Sweet Land, a popular candy-themed prize machine. One of Namco's biggest hits from the era was the racing game Final Lap from 1987. It is credited as the first arcade game to allow multiple machines to be connected—or "linked"—together to allow for additional players. Final Lap was one of the most-profitable coin-operated games of the era in Japan, remaining towards the top of sales charts for the rest of the decade. Namco's continued success in arcades provided its arcade division with the revenue and resources needed to fund its research and development (R&D) divisions.Among the first creations of Namco's R&D teams was the helicopter shooter Metal Hawk in 1988, fitted in a motion-based arcade cabinet. Its high development costs prevented it from being massed-produced. While most of its efforts were commercially unsuccessful, Namco grew interested in motion-based arcade games and began designing those at a larger scale. In 1988, Namco became involved in film production when it distributed the film Mirai Ninja in theaters, with a tie-in video game coinciding with its release. Namco also developed the beat 'em up Splatterhouse, one of the earliest "violent" video games for its fixture on gore and dismemberment. Namco unveiled its System 21 arcade system, one of the earliest arcade boards to utilize true 3D polygonal graphics, in early 1989. Nicknamed "Polygonizer", the company demonstrated its power through the Formula One racer Winning Run. With an arcade cabinet that shook and swayed the player as they drove, the game was seen as "a breakthrough product in term of programming technique" and garnered significant attention from the press. Winning Run was commercially successful, convincing Namco to continue researching 3D video game hardware. Video arcades under the Namco banner continued opening up in Japan and overseas, such as the family-friendly Play City Carrot and mature-oriented Plabo chains.


=== Expansion into other markets (1989–1994) ===
Namco saw continued success in the consumer game market as a result of the "Famicom boom" in the late 1980s. By 1989, sales of games for the Famicom and NES accounted for 40% of its annual revenue. However, during the same time frame, the company's licensing contract with Nintendo expired; when Namco attempted to renew its license, Nintendo chose to revoke many of the preferential terms it originally possessed. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi insisted that all companies, including Namco, had to follow the same guidelines. The revocation of Namco's terms enraged Nakamura, who announced the company would abandon Nintendo hardware and begin production of games for competing systems such as the PC Engine. Executives resisted the idea, fearing it would severely impact the company financially. Against Nakamura's protest, Namco signed Nintendo's new licensee contract anyway. While it continued to produce games for Nintendo hardware, most of Namco's quality releases came from the PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive.

In 1989, it was reported that Namco was underway with developing its own video game console to compete against companies such as Nintendo and NEC. Electronic Gaming Monthly claimed that the system, which was nearing completion, featured hardware comparable to the then-upcoming Nintendo Super Famicom. According to company engineer Yutaka Isokawa, it was produced to compete against the Mega Drive, a 16-bit console by Namco's arcade rival Sega. With the console industry being crowded by other competing systems, publications were unsure how well it would perform in the market. While the console was never released, it allowed Namco to familiarize itself with designing home video game hardware.Tadashi Manabe replaced Nakamura as president of Namco on May 2, 1990. Manabe, who had been the company's representative director since 1981, was tasked with strengthening relationships and teamwork ethics of management. A company reorganization lead to Namco America acquiring Atari Operations from Atari Games, allowing Namco to operate video arcades across the United States. Namco Hometek was established as the home console game division of Namco America; the latter's relations with Atari Games and Tengen made the company ineligible to become a Nintendo third-party licensee, instead relying on publishers such as Bandai to release its games in North America. In Japan, Namco's R&D division finished development of two theme park attractions, which were demonstrated at the 1990 International Garden and Greenery Exposition (Expo '90): Galaxian3: Project Dragoon, a 3D rail shooter that supported 28 players, and a dark ride based on The Tower of Druaga. As part of the company's idea of "hyperentertainment" video games, Namco engineers had drafted ideas for a possible theme park based on Namco's experience with designing and operating indoor play areas and entertainment complexes. Both attractions were commercially successful and among the most popular of Expo 90's exhibitions. In arcades, Namco released Starblade, a 3D rail shooter noteworthy for its cinematic presentation.In February 1992, Namco opened its own theme park, Wonder Eggs, in the Futakotamagawa Time Spark area in Setagaya, Tokyo. Described as an "urban amusement center", Wonder Eggs was the first amusement park operated by a video game company. In addition to Galaxian3 and The Tower of Druaga, the park featured carnival games, carousals, motion simulators, and Fighter Camp, the first flight simulator available to the public. The park saw regularly high attendance numbers; 500,000 visitors attended in its first few months of operation and over one million by the end of the year. Namco's foray in the amusement park business was in response to its high net income and annual revenue from the end of its fiscal year. The park contributed to Namco's 34% increase in revenue by December 1992.

As his anxiety disorder prevented from properly running the company, Manabe resigned as president on May 1, 1992. As Nakamura returning to his role as Namco president, Manabe instead served as the company's vice chairman until his death in 1994. Namco's arcade division saw resounding success with the release of Ridge Racer in 1993, a racing game that demonstrated the capabilities of the company's System 22 board. With its usage of drifting and fully textured 3D graphics, Ridge Racer became one of Namco's most-successful games and is seen as a milestone in 3D computer graphics. The company followed its success with Tekken, a 3D fighting game, a year later. Designed by Virtua Fighter co-creator Seiichi Ishii, Tekken's wide array of playable characters and consistent framerate made it outperform Sega's game in popularity, and launched a multi-million-selling franchise as a result. The company continued expanding its operations, particularly within its overseas divisions; Namco America acquired Atari Operations in July 1993 and renamed it Namco Operations, allowing the company to operate video arcades across the United States. Further acquisitions were made throughout the year, such as the Aladdin's Castle chain from Bally Entertainment. In December, Namco of Japan acquired Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest-surviving film studio that at the time was undergoing bankruptcy procedures. The purchase allowed Nikkatsu to utilize Namco's computer graphics hardware for its films, while Namco was able to get a niche in the Japanese film industry.


=== Relationship with Sony (1994–1998) ===

In early 1994, Sony announced that it was developing its own video game console, the 32-bit PlayStation. The console began as a collaboration between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-based peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Fearing that Sony would assume control of the entire project, Nintendo silently scrapped the add-on. Sony chose to refocus its efforts in designing the PlayStation in-house as its own console. As it lacked the resources to produce its own games, Sony called for the support of third-party companies to develop PlayStation software. Namco, frustrated with Nintendo and Sega's licensing conditions for its consoles, agreed to support the PlayStation and became its first third-party developer. The company began work on a conversion of Ridge Racer, its most-popular arcade game at the time. The PlayStation launched in Japan on December 3, 1994, with Ridge Racer as a launch title. Sony moved 100,000 units on launch day alone; publications attributed Ridge Racer to the PlayStation's early success, giving it an edge over its competitor the Sega Saturn. For a time, it was the best-selling PlayStation game in Japan.Namcot was consolidated into Namco in 1995; its final game was a PlayStation conversion of Tekken, published in March in Japan and in November worldwide. As the arcade version ran on Namco's System 11 board—based on raw PlayStation hardware—the home console version was able to be a near-perfect arcade conversion. Tekken is the first PlayStation game to sell one million copies, with Namco receiving a Guinness World Record for this achievement. Sony recognized Namco's quality arcade conversions for helping the PlayStation gain ground in the market, leading to a strong corporate relationship between the two companies. Early promotional material for the PlayStation adopted the tagline "PlayStation: Powered by Namco", while several of Namco's arcade boards were designed after PlayStation hardware. Its experience with designing its failed 16-bit console allowed the company to produce several peripherals for the PlayStation, such as the GunCon, the NeGcon, and the Namco Arcade Stick. Namco focused primarily on the PlayStation for the remainder of the decade; while it had signed contracts to produce games for systems such as the Sega Saturn and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, these were later dropped in favor of Sony. In December, the company released Time Crisis in arcades, a lightgun shooter notable for allowing players to duck behind objects to avoid enemy fire. Namco Cybertainment acquired the Edison Brothers Stores chain in April 1996, and in Japan Namco opened its Wonder Tower amusement center in Kyoto.
In September 1997, Namco announced it would begin development of games for the Nintendo 64, a console struggling to receive support from third-party developers. Namco signed a contract with Nintendo that allowed the company to produce two games for the console: Famista 64, a version of its Family Stadium series, and an untitled RPG for the 64DD peripheral. The RPG was never released while the 64DD went on to become a commercial failure. In October 1998, which one publication described as being "the most stunning alliance this industry has seen in a long while", Namco announced a partnership deal with long-time rival Sega to bring some of its titles to the newly unveiled Dreamcast. As Namco primarily developed games for Sony hardware, and were among the biggest third-party developers for the PlayStation, the announcement surprised news outlets. For its PlayStation-based System 12 arcade board, Namco released the weapon-based fighting game Soulcalibur in 1998. Its 1999 Dreamcast port, which features multiple graphical enhancements and new gamemodes, is an early instance of a console game being better than its arcade version. Soulcalibur sold over one million units, won multiple awards, and contributed to the early success of the Dreamcast.


=== Financial decline and restructuring (1998–2005) ===
As a result of the Japanese Recession affecting the demand for video games, specifically arcade games, Namco experienced decline in its sales by 1998. While it saw success with titles such as Tekken 3, the company's arcade game division slumped by 21% in March as sales sharply declined. Namco Cybertainment underwent Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August, being forced to close several hundreds of its under-performing arcades across the United States. According to its 1998 annual report, Namco reported a 26.3% drop in its net sales, which it attributed to low consumer spending. In light of its struggling finances, the company continued expanding operations. In October 1999 it acquired the action-RPG game developer Monolith Soft, known for series such as Xenosaga, and entered the Japanese mobile phone market by releasing ports of games like Galaxian and Pac-Man for i-Mode cellular phones. In February 2000, Namco introduced the Cyber Lead II arcade cabinet, which featured PlayStation and Dreamcast VMU memory card slots that allowed players to transfer game data between systems.

During a meeting with industry analysts on October 25, 2000, Namco supposedly hinted at a major financial loss. On October 29, Nihon Keizai Shinbun reported that it experienced a group net loss of ¥2.1 billion; as the company was known for its consistently high sales earnings, the announcement spread fear among analysts. Claiming that the struggling Japanese economy and dwindling coin-operated game market were to blame, Namco announced it would begin scaling back its financial forecasts to accommodate its losses. As the Japanese game market began to decline during the mid to late-1990s, its effect started seeping into the global arcade game industry as well. The Wonder Eggs park, which by that point had seen an attendance number of six million visitors, was closed on December 31, 2000. Following Sega and Taito's lead, Namco began closing many of its under-performing video arcades. While its arcade cabinets and games were still proving profitable, sales were lower than expected. In February, it reported further losses from a securities appraisal loss, restructuring Nikkatsu, and writing off a pension fund shortfall, which costed the company over ¥6.1 billion. By March 31, a total of ¥6.5 billion had been lost, which the company blamed on diminishing markets and high research and development costs.In response to its falling sales, Namco laid off 250 employees—which it referred to as "early retirement"—and began finding ways to restructure itself and increase income. In addition to announcing production of games for Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox, company management was shifted while its arcade division underwent reorganization. Namco saw strong success with the release of Taiko no Tatsujin, a popular drum-based rhythm game. The company entered the pachinko industry with machines based on its intellectual properties including Pac-Man, Xevious, and Gator Panic. Nakamura resigned from his position as Namco president later in the year, instead taking on a ceremonial role in its management.Particularly with its consumer game division, Namco began seeing improvement within its sales. The PlayStation 2 conversion of Taiko no Tatsujin, bundled with a drum controller named the Tatacon, was among its most-successful products. In addition to co-developing the Triforce, an arcade system board designed after the internals of the GameCube, Namco established a business alliance with Nintendo that allowed the two companies to collaborate with each other on GameCube games. Projects under this alliance include Star Fox Assault, Pac-Man Vs., Mr. Driller Drill Land, Mario Superstar Baseball, and the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable peripheral. The company's overseas operations had seen considerably less positive results, as Namco America and Namco Hometek both underwent a corporate restructuring in September in result of decreasing profits. Namco's disappointment in the quality of Hometek's releases led to the latter being stripped of its research and development operations.In April 2003, Namco offered to merge its operations with Sega, who were struggling financially following the commercial failure of the Dreamcast. The merge would have established a new company named Sega Namco and become the largest Japanese video game developer, surpassing Nintendo, Konami, and Square Enix in revenue. Namco claimed that a merge was necessary in order for the company to remain competitive in the industry, and believed that Sega's development teams and catalog of recognizable properties would prove beneficial for both parties. When Namco applied its offer, Sega already announced its intent to merge with pachinko manufacturer Sammy Corporation. After a failed attempt to overturn the merge, Namco withdrew its offer the same day Sega stated it turned down the offer to merge with Sammy. Its Japanese division in March released the sleeper hit Katamari Damacy, which stemmed from a school project created at the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory, and opened a Korean office in August where it hoped to bring significant expansion to the country's game market.Shigeichi Ishimura, one of Namco's board members, became company president on April 1, 2005; Nakamura retained his role as chairman. In celebration of its 50th anniversary, Namco released NamCollection, a compilation of some of its most-popular PlayStation game, for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. Its Namja Town theme park opened Riraku no Mori, a companion park that held massage parlors for visitors; Namco believed it would help make relaxation a source of entertainment. In the arcade industry, the company released The Idolmaster; its unique cross between rhythm games and life simulations made it successful in Japan, resulting in the creation of a multi-million-grossing franchise.


=== Bandai takeover and dissolution (2005–2006) ===

In early 2005, Namco instigated talks with Bandai–a toy and anime company–over the two merging operations. Bandai showed interest in Namco's quality game development skills, and believed combining this with its wide library of profitable franchises, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, could increase their competitiveness. Both companies had discussed the previous year about a possible business alliance, but Bandai felt that Namco's similar business ideas and concepts could allow the two to join forces. The deal was opposed by Nakamura and advisors within Namco's content development divisions, as neither felt Bandai's corporate model and preference on marketing over quality would work well with Namco's design philosophies and "agricultural" work culture. However, as its financial state continued deteriorating and its executives were concerned the business wouldn't be able to operate independently, Namco believed a merge was necessary in order to survive the current industry landscape. Bandai's offer was accepted on May 2, with both companies saying in a joint statement that their difficulties in securing substantial profits were the reason for the merge.The business takeover, where Bandai acquired Namco for $1.7 billion, was finalized on September 29. An entertainment conglomerate named Namco Bandai Holdings was established the same day; while their executive departments merged, Bandai and Namco became independently-operating subsidiaries of the new umbrella holding company. Kyushiro Takagi, Namco's vice chairman, was appointed chairman and director of Namco Bandai Holdings. The stock swap was valued at ¥458 billion upon its completion, making Namco Bandai the third-largest Japanese game company after Nintendo and Sega Sammy Holdings. However, Namco Bandai's impatience to move forward with the merge and clashing corporate cultures between both parties resulted in a ¥30 billion deficit. As its parent company was preparing for a full business integration, Namco continued its normal operations, such as releasing Ridge Racer 6 as a launch title for the newly-unveiled Xbox 360 in October and collaborating with Nintendo to produce the arcade game Mario Kart Arcade GP. The company honored the 25th anniversary of its Pac-Man series with the Nintendo DS puzzle game Pac-Pix, and entered the massively multiplayer online game market with Tales of Eternia Online, an action role-playing game based on its Tales franchise.

On January 4, 2006, Namco Hometek was merged with Bandai Games—Bandai America's consumer game division—to create Namco Bandai Games America, absorbing Namco America's subsidiaries and completing Namco and Bandai's merge in North America. Namco's console game, business program, mobile phone, and research facility divisions were merged with Bandai's console division to create a new company, Namco Bandai Games, on March 31, as Namco was effectively dissolved. The Namco brand name was repurposed for a new Namco Bandai subsidiary the same day, which absorbed its predecessor's amusement facility and theme park operations. Namco's European division was folded into Namco Bandai Networks Europe on January 1, 2007, as it was reorganized into the company's mobile game and website division. Until February 2014, Namco Bandai Games used the Namco branding on several of its products as a means to signify its legacy.The Namco Cybertainment division was renamed Namco Entertainment in January 2012, and to Namco USA in 2015. A division of Bandai Namco Holdings USA, Namco USA works with chains such as Walmart to host its video arcades in their respective locations. As of 2018, Namco USA, Namco Enterprises Asia, and Namco Funscape—the amusement facility division of Bandai Namco Europe—remain the last companies within the holding company to use the original Namco trademark. The second Namco company was renamed Bandai Namco Amusement on April 1, 2018 following a corporate restructuring by its parent company. Amusement took over the arcade game development branch of Namco Bandai Games, which renamed itself to Bandai Namco Entertainment in 2015. Bandai Namco Holdings and its subsidiaries continue to use the Namco name for a variety of products, including mobile phone applications, streaming programs, and its line of eSports-focused arcade centers in Japan.


== Legacy ==
Namco was one of the world's largest producers of video arcade games, having published over 280 titles since 1978. Many of its games are considered some of the greatest of all time, including Pac-Man, Galaga, Xevious, Ridge Racer, Tekken 3, and Katamari Damacy.Pac-Man is considered one of the most-important video games ever made, having helped transition the industry from Space Invaders clone games to encouraging originality and creative thinking. Namco was recognized for the game's worldwide success in 2005 by Guinness World Records; by that timeframe, Pac-Man sold over 400,000 arcade units and grossed over $1 billion in quarters globally. In an obituary for Masaya Nakamura in 2017, Nintendo Life's Damien McFerran wrote: "without Namco and Pac-Man, the video game arena would be very different today."Namco's corporate philosophy and innovation have received recognition from publications. In a 1994 retrospective on the company, a writer for Edge described Namco as being "among the true pioneers of the coin-op business", a developer with a catalog of well-received and historically significant titles. The writer believed that Namco's success lied in its forward-thinking and firmness on quality, which they argued made it stand out from other developers. A staff member of Edge's sister publication, Next Generation, wrote in 1998: "In a world where today's stars almost always become tomorrow's has-beens, Namco has produced consistently excellent games throughout most of its history." The writer credited the company's connections with its players and its influential releases, namely Pac-Man, Xevious, and Winning Run, as the keys to its success in a rapidly changing industry.Publications and industry journalists have identified Namco's importance to the industry. Writers for Ultimate Future Games and Official UK PlayStation Magazine have credited the company and its games to the early success of the PlayStation, one of the most iconic entertainment brands worldwide. In addition, Official UK PlayStation Magazine wrote that Namco serves as "the godfather of game developers", and one of the most important video game developers in history. Staff for IGN in 1997 claimed that Namco represents the industry as a whole, with titles like Pac-Man and Galaga being associated with and representing video games. They wrote: "Tracing the history of Namco is like tracing the history of the industry itself. From its humble beginnings on the roof of a Yokohama department store, to the impending release of Tekken 3 for the PlayStation, Namco has always stayed ahead of the pack." In 2012, IGN listed Namco among the greatest video game companies of all time, writing that many of its games—including Galaga, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Ridge Racer—were of consistent quality and helped define the industry as a whole.
