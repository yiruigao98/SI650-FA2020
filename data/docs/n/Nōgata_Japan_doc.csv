== History ==
From the end of 19th century to the mid-20th century, Nōgata flourished as a center for mining coal. The Chikuhō region had the largest output of coal in Japan, but as the primary energy source changed from coal to oil, all coal mines were closed. Since then, Nōgata has suffered from a declining population.
The oldest recorded meteorite fall occurred at Nōgata on May 19 in the year of 861. (ja:直方隕石)
