The United States Navy operated a HF radio communications base north of Nea Makri from the mid to the late 20th century. The transmitters were located further north, at Kato Souli. The callsign of the station was NGR. The American naval communications station was the deployment location for Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133, homeported in Gulfport, MS.
