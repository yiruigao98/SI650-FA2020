The proceeds were donated to the library to assist with the cost of relocating it from the old Lawson's store area the Olde Town Hall building across the street. The next year, in 1976, in addition to celebrating the bicentennial, the festival was held in honor Harold Sweet, a sweet corn grower in North Ridgeville, for all that he did for the youth and citizens of the city. The proceeds from this festival were donated to purchase trees for the then new Bainbridge Extension along with 2 bicentennial flags for City Hall.
