Xiaogan (Chinese: 孝感; pinyin: Xiàogǎn) is a prefecture-level city in east-central Hubei province, People's Republic of China, some 60 kilometres (37 mi) northwest of the provincial capital of Wuhan. According to the 2010 census, its population totaled 4,814,542, of whom 908,266 lived in the built-up (or metro) area of Xiaonan District.
The city name Xiaogan, meaning Filial Piety Moves [the Heaven] (Chinese: 孝行感天), is from the story of Dong Yong (Chinese: 董永), who sold himself for his father's funeral, in The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars.The Sheshui River originates in Xiaogan's Dawu County. On the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, many in Wuhan eat 'di cai zhu ji dan' (地菜煮鸡蛋) which is supposed to prevent illness in the coming year. This practice is related to a story involving Shennong in Xiaogan.
