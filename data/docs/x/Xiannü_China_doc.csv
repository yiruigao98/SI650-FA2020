In October 2005, Zhijiang was in the news because one of the delegates to its (county-level) People's Congress, Lu Banglie (吕邦列), a village-rights activist, was savagely beaten on October 8, 2005 in the village of Taishi (太石), in Yuwotou town, Panyu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, by unknown persons. The beating was witnessed by Benjamin Joffe-Walt, correspondent for The Guardian newspaper of the UK, who was himself threatened and believed Lü had been killed.
Since 2004, Lü has been the popularly elected head of Baoyuesi village (宝月寺村; 30°20′31″N 111°41′01″E), in the town of Bailizhou (百里洲镇), situated on a peninsula in the Yangtze River and the only town in Zhijiang not on the river's left bank; there is no road connection between Bailizhou and the city's other towns. He is the first elected village head in the history of the People's Republic of China.
The beating may have been intended to prevent a similar popular election from taking place in Taishi.
