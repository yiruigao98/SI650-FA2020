Xinghua (simplified Chinese: 兴化; traditional Chinese: 興化; pinyin: Xīnghuà) is a county-level city under the administration of Taizhou, Jiangsu province, China. It is located in the central part of Jiangsu Province. It borders the prefecture-level cities of Yancheng to the north and east and Yangzhou to the west.
Xinghua's name (兴化) is the abbreviation for "兴盛教化" (xīngshèng jiàohuà) which means "prospering (the Confucian) teaching".


== History ==
In 920, Wu of the Ten Kingdoms separated the northern part of then Hailing county to establish Xinghua county. The land which was used to boil the brine was called Zhaoyuanchang before that.
The county was downgraded as Zhaoyang township in 1135, but was restored in 1149.
In 1987, the county was turned into a city of Yangzhou.
Basically, the area was under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou until 1996, being reassign to Taizhou.
