The Republic of China Navy (ROCN; Chinese: 中華民國海軍; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Mínguó Hǎijūn), also known as the Taiwan Navy is the maritime branch of the Republic of China Armed Forces. The ROC Navy's primary mission is to defend ROC territories and the sea lanes that surround Taiwan against a blockade, attack, or possible invasion by the People's Liberation Army Navy of the People's Republic of China. Operations include maritime patrols in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters, as well as counter-strike and counter-invasion operations during wartime. The Republic of China Marine Corps functions as a branch of the Navy.
The ship prefix for ROCN combatants is ROCS (Republic of China Ship); an older usage is CNS (Chinese Navy Ship).

== History ==


=== 1912–1949 ===

The precursor to the modern ROC Navy was established as the Ministry of the Navy in the Provisional Government of the Republic of China in 1911 following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Liu Guanxiong, a former Qing dynasty admiral, became the first Minister of Navy of the Republic of China. During the period of warlordism that scarred China in the 1920s and 1930s the ROCN remained loyal to the Kuomintang government of Sun Yat-sen instead of the warlord government in Beijing which fell to the nationalist government in the 1928 northern campaign and between the civil war with the Communist Party and 1937 Japanese invasion of Northeast China. During that time and throughout World War II, the ROCN concentrated mainly on riverine warfare as the poorly equipped ROCN was not a match to Imperial Japanese Navy over ocean or coast.Following World War II, a number of Japanese destroyers and decommissioned U.S. ships were transferred to the ROC Navy. During the Chinese Civil War, the ROCN was involved in the protection of supply convoys and the withdrawal of the ROC Government and over 1 million refugees to Taiwan in 1949. The subsequent reorganization and reestablishment of the Navy after evacuation to Taiwan is referenced in the lyrics of the post 1949 ROC Navy Song "The New Navy" (新海軍).


=== 1949–present ===
Following the relocation of the ROC government to Taiwan, the ROCN was involved in a number of commando attack escorts, evacuation and transport of more displaced soldiers and later to provide patrols and resupply operations to Kinmen and Matsu in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea offshore islands.
Since the 1990s the Navy has grown in importance as the emphasis of the ROC's military doctrine moves towards countering a possible People's Republic of China (PRC) blockade, as well as offshore engagement. As of 2004 the ROCN had been working hard to expand its capability in electronic and anti-submarine warfare, as well as the replacement of antiquated warships and support vessels. While for many years the ROCN operated hand me down and foreign designed vessels in recent years they have been operating a higher number of indigenous platforms, sensors, and weapons much of it made by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology.In 2018 Lungteh Shipbuilding was awarded a contract to produce eleven Tuo Chiang Block II corvettes and four minelayers for the Taiwanese Navy.In April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the ROCN cut short their semi-annual goodwill mission to Central and South America. The flotilla consisting of two frigates and a supply vessel was subject to 30 days of quarantine after returning to Taiwan.In April 2020 Taiwanese boatbuilder Karmin International Co., Ltd. won a NT$450-million (US$14.9-million) contract to supply the Republic of China Navy with eighteen special operations watercraft and eight RIB tenders, the later for the Cheng Kung-class frigates. Delivery is scheduled for June 2022. The contract covered only the watercraft themselves with their machine guns, infrared equipment, and boarding ladders sourced separately.

== Equipment ==

Traditionally, most ROCN equipment is purchased from the United States, though several ships have been built domestically under licence or through domestic development. The ROCN has also purchased La Fayette-class frigates from France and Zwaardvis-class submarines from the Netherlands as well as four U.S. Kidd-class (renamed Keelung) destroyers originally intended for Iran.
Despite the ROCN refurbishing and extending the service life of its vessels and equipment, it has suffered from procurement difficulties due to pressures exerted by the PRC. It has only two useful submarines. The U.S. has approved sales of eight new diesel-powered submarines but lacks the manufacturing capability to make the engines; at the same time, threats from the PRC prevent the necessary technology transfer from other countries. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan did not approve the budget and thereby slowed the opportunity to procure the badly needed underwater defense capability.
On 12 September 2007, an arms notification was sent to the United States Congress concerning an order for 12 P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and 3 "spare aircraft", along with an order for 144 SM-2 Block IIIA surface-to-air missiles. A contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin to refurbish the 12 P-3C Orion aircraft for the ROC on 13 March 2009, with deliveries to start in 2012.In 2008, the ROCN set out to acquire an improved anti-ship capability. On 26 August, an arms notification was sent to Congress for an order for 60 air-launched Harpoon Block II missiles for the 12 P-3Cs. At least a portion of these missiles will be installed on the navy's Hai Lung-class submarines.
On 29 January 2010, the U.S. government announced five notifications to the U.S. Congress for arms sales to the ROC. In the contracts total US$6.392 billion, ROC Navy would get 2 Osprey-class minehunters for US$105 million, 25 Link 16 terminals on ships for US$340 million, 10 ship- and 2 air-launched Harpoon L/II for US$37 million.The ROC Navy already has 95 older Harpoon missiles in its inventory for the 8 Knox-class frigates, 22 newer RGM-84L for the 4 Kidd-class destroyers, 32 sub-launched Harpoon II on order for the 2 Hai Lung-class submarines, and with 60 air-launched Harpoon Block II anti-ship missile on order for the 12 P-3Cs, plus the newly announced 10 ship-launched and 2 air-launched Harpoon II/L sales.On 31 August 2010, it was announced for the next year's defense budget, ROCN planned to lease one or two more Newport-class tank landing ships (LST) from the United States, but the 900-ton stealth corvette plan was put on hold, due to lack of funds. That same year, On 29 September, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution, authorizing the U.S. Government for the sale of one more Osprey-class minehunter to the ROC.Other ongoing local upgrade programs include locally designed and built Ching Chiang class of 12 patrol ships that were designed back in the 1990s to carry four HF-1 anti-ship missiles on board but only the lead ship of the class had them. Since 2006, seven ships of this class were upgraded to carry four HF-2/3 with W-160 fire control radar from Wu Chin III program (as well as Honeywell H-930 MCS CDS stripped from seven retired Yang-class Wu Chin 3 anti-air warfare destroyers). In 2010 more ships of this class were undergoing this same upgrade program but using CSIST produced fire control radars instead. Currently four different variants exist within this class, the original Ching Chiang patrol ship constructed with four HF-1 (one existing in this configuration).
On 29 December 2010, two LSTs (中肇、中治戰車登陸艦) and four remaining of Adjutant-class coastal minehunters were retired.In 2011, the navy retired several vessels. On 31 October, all eight PCL in the 124th Fleet were retired. On 28 December, the two Lung Jiang-class (PSMM Mk5) guided missile patrol boats (PGG 601 and PPG 602) of the 131st Fleet were retired from ROC Navy service, after entering service in 1978 and 1981 respectively.

In June 2018, two Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates of the US Navy, ex-USS Taylor and ex-USS Gary, were handed over to the Government of Taiwan for the Republic of China Navy. The transfer cost was an estimated US$177 million. The transfer of the ships includes the advanced AN/SQR-19 Multi-Function Towed array sonar. Taiwan had previously been blocked from acquiring the AN/SQR-19, and the transfer of the system points to an anti-submarine focus in line with the Knox-class frigates they will likely replace.


=== Indigenous ‘Landing Platform Dock’ / Amphibious Assault Ship ===
In September 2018, Taiwan confirms contract for first amphibious assault ship built in Taiwan. It will be built by CSBC Corporation, a local shipyard. Four are planned with the first to be entering service around 2021. It is roughly similar to US Navy's San Antonio class, but with a slightly smaller displacement. Support features include a full hospital, well deck, full aviation facilities, storage for wheeled vehicles, and dedicated accommodations for a full battalion of Marines. The vessel design will be armed with a 76 mm naval gun in the primary position, a close-in weapon system (CIWS) turret, two 12.7 mm machine gun positions in the forward section, and launchers that can deploy the Hsiung Feng II and III family of anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles. The primary sensor is expected to be a naval version of the indigenous CS/MPQ-90 Bee Eye AESA radar.


=== Fleet Air Defense Upgrade / Hsun Lien Project ===
The ROC Navy currently lacks a modern fleet defense system. Its current destroyers currently use obsolete Mark 26 missile launchers designed from the 1970s and does not currently have a modern centralized air defense combat system like the Aegis. Past US administrations rejected the sale of Aegis radar system and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, including George W. Bush in 2001. Under George W. Bush administration, the US instead sold Taiwan four Kidd-class destroyers, which did not carry the Aegis and were no longer in service in the US Navy at the time. However, in January 2019, the US government delivered two sets of Mk 41 VLS to Taiwan. The ROC government plans to integrate the MK41 VLS and locally developed Tien-Kung III (Sky Bow III) with its indigenously developed Hsun Lien naval combat system, which is similar to Aegis, to upgrade its ship air defense capabilities. Taiwan has acquired the license and technology to produce additional MK 41 VLS launchers. The ROC Navy currently as of 2019 possesses at least 14 warships compatible with the Mk41. Additionally, the AN/SLQ-32 system on the Kee Lung class guided missile destroyers (formerly Kidd-Class Destroyers) will be upgraded and is expected to be completed by 2023. In November 2019 it was reported that the decommissioned amphibious landing ship Kao Hsiung (LCC-1) was being used as a test ship for the Hsun Lien naval combat system project and had been fitted with a large phased array radar system and the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System. In January 2020, it is reported the Tien-Kung III (Sky Bow III) is successfully fired from the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System.


=== Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS) Program ===
With its two effective submarines being of Dutch design manufactured in the late 1980s, Taiwan has been trying to acquire more modern submarines for over 20-years; but the US only makes large nuclear submarines, and other sellers of conventional submarines have been scarce. In 2003 the US Government brokered an offer and suggested buying four (even older and smaller) Nazario Sauro-class submarines from Italy (which the Italians would completely refurbish). Italy reportedly also agreed to sell them an additional four other later vintage Sauro-class submarines still on active duty with the Italian Navy, for a total of eight, following their eventual decommissioning by the Italian Navy. However, Taipei rejected this offer, saying it wanted new submarines. In subsequent years no other solution was found.
Whilst Taiwan was actively seeking to purchase diesel-electric submarines from other nations, it started considering the possibility of building the required eight submarines indigenously, after repeated failures to strike an overseas deal. A squadron of modern submarines would greatly improve the Navy's defensive capabilities. However building submarines is a very daunting technological project. On 15 April 2014, the Defence Minister Yen Ming announced that the United States agreed to help Taiwan to construct its own diesel-electric attack submarines (SSKs).In April 2018, President of the United States Donald Trump approved the license necessary for American firms to sell Taiwan the technology needed to build its own submarines. In July 2018, it was reported that a company from India and a defense contractor from Japan had submitted design proposals for the Indigenous Defense Submarine program alongside two companies from America and another two from Europe.In May 2019, Taiwan revealed a scale model of its chosen design for an indigenous built diesel-electric attack submarine. The external design appears to be similar to Japan's Soryu– and Oyashio-class SSKs and includes an X-form rudder similar to one found on Sōryū-class submarine. The boats will be assembled using Japanese construction techniques in Taiwan. A Japanese team consisting of 'retired' engineers from Mitsubishi and Kawasaki Heavy Industries will provide technical support. Reportedly, a version of the AN/BYG-1 submarine combat management system, used in US Navy nuclear submarines, is being offered to Taiwan (as no other foreign manufacturer's systems are available). The vessels are projected to be in the 2,500-ton class and 70m in length.In October 2019 it was reported that construction of the class would commence at the Heping Island yard in Keelung rather than in Kaohsiung. Later in October 2019 it was reported that personnel working on the project were forbidden from traveling to or transiting through Macao or Hong Kong (their travel to Mainland China had already been restricted) due to security concerns.


=== Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) Flight II Tuo Chiang Class Corvette Program ===

In May 2019, the Republic of China Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced it had begun construction of three Flight-II Tuo Chiang class corvettes (also known as Tuo Jiang class). The ships will be built by Lung Teh Shipbuilding. The Tuo Chiang-class corvette is a class of stealthy multi-mission catamarans based on the single Tuo Chiang class Flight I prototype launched in 2014. They have a length of 65 meters and a displacement of 680 tonnes versus 560 tons for the existing Flight I. Their top speed remains around 45 knots. It features improved upper structure design with fewer extrusions to reduce radar signature, pre-cooled engine exhaust to reduce infrared signature, and a reduced visual signature. It can be armed with up to twelve subsonic Hsiung Feng II or supersonic Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missiles of which can be mixed configuration, a Phalanx Close-In Weapons System which may be replaced by  Sea Oryx in the future, and a 76-mm main gun. In air defense configuration, it will contain a four-cell vertical launch system array. Each cell is quad-packed with four Tien Chien IIN, or Sky Sword IIN, medium-range surface-to-air missiles, for a total of 16 missiles.
