== History ==


=== Portuguese rule ===
Xai-Xai, formerly João Belo, developed in the early 1900s, under Portuguese rule, as a companion port to Lourenço Marques (currently Maputo), though its economic significance was never on par with Mozambique's largest city. Before independence from Portugal in 1975, Xai-Xai was known as João Belo, in the Overseas Province of Mozambique. João Belo grew and developed under Portuguese rule as a port, agricultural and industrial centre (rice and cashew were harvested and processed), a provider of services, including a district hospital and banking, and an administrative centre. Tourism was also important with beaches and hotels. In 1970, the city had 63,949 inhabitants.


=== Post-independence from Portugal ===
It was hit hard by the 2000 Limpopo floods, with some buildings 3 metres (10 ft) under water. However, shortly after the waters receded the town was opened for business again.

== Attractions ==
Xai-Xai is a bustling town with markets, shops, restaurants, bars, petrol stations, banks, and a post office. A few blocks from the central market, there is an open-air furniture factory, located underneath several cashew trees. The beach of Praia do Xai-Xai, approximately 12 km from Xai-Xai, has been a popular tourist attraction since Mozambican tourism, originally under Portuguese administration, was first developed before 1975. A coral reef running parallel to the shore offers good snorkeling and protects the beach from strong waves. In addition, the Wenela Tidal Pool, 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) south of the town, includes a natural tunnel and blow hole that links the pool to the Indian Ocean. 
Right on Praia de Xai Xai Beach there is a giant rock pool that forms at medium and low tides that is up to 200 metres long, forming a giant safe pool for families and swimmers.
