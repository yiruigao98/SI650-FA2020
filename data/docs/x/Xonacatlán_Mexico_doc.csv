== History ==
The date of the town's foundation is not historically recorded. However, it was conquered in 1476 by Axayácatl during the conquest of the valley of Toluca. The town fell to the invading Spanish forces in 1521. The independence of Mexico in 1821 contributed to the town's prosperity. The town was originally assigned to part of another municipality, but Celso Vicencio Hernández advocated for its municipal status in the State of Mexico's legislature, ultimately successfully, and municipal status was conferred on October 18, 1870. Afterward, political power was held by a few dominated by the Vicencio family. Upon Celso Vicencio's death on February 19, 1908, the city government proclaimed the renaming of the town to Xonacatlán de Vicencio.  The city hall was built from 1931 to 1945.
