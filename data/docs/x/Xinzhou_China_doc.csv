== Tourism ==
Dai County is home to the AAAAA-rated Yanmen Pass, a mountain pass hosting a major fortification along the Great Wall.


== Education ==
Xinzhou has numerous public high schools. And Xin Zhou Yi Zhong Xue (Xin Zhou Number One High School), is considered the most prestigious public high school in this region.
Another public high school of interest is the nearby laboratory high school. It functions as an extension of the Xin Zhou Normal University. The third famous high school is the Xin Zhou Shi Yan Zhong Xue (Xin Zhou Experimental High School). This school was initiated as a public-private partnership. The school is partially funded by the Chinese government, follows national educational standards, and maintains close ties (and even joint faculty) with Xin Zhou Yi Zhong Xue; however, it maintains a greater independence from the government than traditional public schools. The experimental school also runs a small primary school program (generally only one classroom per grade level) which is populated almost exclusively by the children of Yi Zhong Xue and Shi Yan Zhong Xue teachers.
