Xinhui, alternately romanized as Sunwui and also known as Kuixiang, is an urban district of Jiangmen in Guangdong, China. It grew from a separate city founded at the confluence of the Tan and West Rivers.

Geologists have shown that Xinhui originated as a shallow bay at the mouth of the Pearl River about 5000 years ago, with its southeastern portion consisting of a chain of islands. The movement of the Tan and West Rivers eventually formed a delta that became the present alluvial plain over the course of the last nine hundred years.
