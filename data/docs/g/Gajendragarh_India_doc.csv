A little known pilgrim of North Karnataka.

There are some large steps that lead you up to the temple. It is a traditional temple with Udhbhava Lingu. There we can find God Virabhadra temple also in the same premises. But one would definitely be amazed at the story in which the significance of the destination lies. Just outside the temple exit is a small square water reservoir called AtharaGange. It is an evergreen water resource that constantly falls along the roots of Peepal tree into the pond all throughout the year. It is said to be flowing even in the peaks of summer season and has an unknown root.

More amazing is the story attached to this destination that has taken a few lives too. These were the daring people who wanted to try to learn more about a miracle that happens on the previous night of Ugadi, New Year of Kannadigas. The pandit/pujari of the temple prepares a solution of limestone, and keeps it ready for application along with a brush, inside the temple. The next morning, the jobs done. But the temple is painted on its own and this happens without fail every year. A hookah that is also kept along with it seems to be used when seen the next morning.
