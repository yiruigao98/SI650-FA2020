== Social structure ==
Gomoh consists of people from diverse religious and professional backgrounds.
The major role in development of Gomoh was of Netaji. For the peoples living in Gomoh there are many problems like lack of education, worst electricity supply and many more.
Religious diversity is the hallmark of Gomoh. A number of Anglo-Indians can be found here since the British era as a result of which Christians are here from a long time. The Sikh community settled here before Independence as businessmen. A gurudwara at Loco Bazar is visited by many Sikhs from surrounding areas every day. Bengalis form a large part of the population and have contributed largely to the culture of this place. However, their population has been dwindling for the last few decades. On Durga Puja one can get a glimpse of Kolkata in Gomoh, especially at Durga Para, which is home to the oldest Durge Puja in the area. Muslims also contribute substantially to the population and culture of this region. There is also a masjid and a madarsa at Purana Bazar and a Jama Masjid at Loco Bazar. Id-Gah and graveyard of Muslims is in Laludih area.
A majority of the people are railway employees (different grades) since Gomoh is a railway-based town. These people do not belong to the city but got transferred from different parts of the country. After retirement, a good number of these employees choose to settle down in Gomoh giving rise to the population of the city. There is a strong business class also in Gomoh. Businesses ranging from food grain wholesaling to clothing and apparel to building material (cement, bricks, iron rods, etc.) to confectionery and bakery products etc. can be found. Though Marwaris are dominating the business scenario, one can find the representation of all the religious groups. Some people are also engaged in agriculture, growing certain cereals and vegetables.
Main festivals celebrated include Durga Puja (Dussehra), Dipawali, Holi, Chatth Puja, Id, Gurunanak Birthday, and Christmas.


== Infrastructure ==
Gomoh has an area of 8.96 km2. It is 37 km from the district headquarters Dhanbad. It has a railway station. Buses are available in the town. It has 50 km roads and both open and closed drains. The two major sources of protected water supply are hand pumps and tap water from treated source. There are 5,313 domestic electric connections and 60 road lighting points. Amongst the medical facilities it has 1 hospital with 30 beds and 12 medicine shops. Amongst the educational facilities, it has 17 primary schools, 13 middle schools, 9 secondary schools, 1 senior secondary school and 1 general degree college. Amongst the recreational and cultural facilities, it has 2 cinema theatres and 1 auditorium/ community hall. It has the branch offices of 3 nationalised banks, 1 cooperative bank and 1 agricultural credit society.


== Education ==
As Gomoh is a small town, only a few educational institutes up to the Secondary level exist. Notable among them is The Kendriya Vidyalaya Gomoh (K.V. Gomoh) which is a school managed by the Railways. There are some more CBSE schools up to Standard X such as Blossom Public School and Guru Nanak Public School , Sarswati Shishu Vidya Mandir and the St. Mary's day school . There are other high schools which are affiliated to Jharkhand Academic Council(JAC) i.e. Azaad Hind High School, Bishop Rockey High School & St. John de Brito High School. 
Girls High School is an all-female school. Perhaps this is why female literacy is higher here than in many prominent cities of Jharkhand and than the national female literacy rate. 
Pandit Nehru Memorial (PNM) College caters to graduation level studies. However, these facilities are not sufficient since students have started taking up various specialized courses in diversified fields. For all such advanced courses students from this area either depend on  Bokaro Steel City (33 km) or Dhanbad (20 km) or go to any metro city. Many students have shown their thread of talent in Olympics, National-level sports, quiz and talent shows. Many youngsters from this place have even participated in various events abroad. For junior kids, a good school exists at Jeetpur, Nurture kindergarten Play School.


== Healthcare ==
Healthcare facilities are also grossly inadequate. Even to this date Gomoh lacks a good doctor as well as a nursing home. Though there are some government and private nursing homes, they fail to provide even the most basic treatment. The medical units operating in the area are:

PHC Gomoh at Jitpur
Railway Hospital (set up by railways for its employees, they also cater to non-railway patients unofficially)
A few other privately run small clinics
