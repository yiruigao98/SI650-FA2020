== History ==

The area surrounding Joinville had been inhabited by the Guarani people for approximately 7,000 years.Even though it is considered a German-Brazilian city, its origins are French: the area of Joinville was the Colônia Dona Francisca, delimited as the dowry to be given to the future husband of Princess Francisca of Brazil, sister of the Brazilian emperor Pedro II. In 1843, Francisca married François d'Orléans, Prince de Joinville, son of King Louis-Philippe of France, and the French prince became the owner of the lands.
In 1851, after the fall of the French monarchy, the French prince negotiated the use of part of his Brazilian lands with German Senator Mathias Schröder, founder of the Colonization Society of Hamburg. This society, made up of bankers, businessmen and merchants, attracted Northern European immigrants to travel to colonize Brazil and establish European communities there. In 1851, the first 118 German and Swiss immigrants arrived in the Brazilian Joinville, followed by 74 Norwegian immigrants. A Royal Palace was built in the city for the prince and princess of Joinville.
From 1851 to 1888, the city of Joinville received 17,000 German immigrants.


=== Founding ===

The city of Joinville was founded by German, Norwegian, Swiss settlers on 9 March 1851. Immigrants from Norway made up a group of men with several professional qualifications, including carpenters, masons, bakers, agriculturalists, and even a veterinarian and physician. Many of the first Norwegian settlers became ill by dysentery, typhoid, and other illnesses. In the first letter home, dated to July 1851, the author explained that “only” four Norwegians were dead so far: Simon Hansen of Helgeland, Lars C. Steensem of Ytterøy, Hans Petter Luttersen of Horten, and Martin Nordby of Larvik. Between 1851–1852, 41 Norwegians left Joinville and seven died.A monument was erected by Rio Cachoeira in the city centre in 2001, in honor of the Norwegian, Swiss, and German settlers.


== Geography ==

Joinville is located in the northeast of the State of Santa Catarina, close to the Atlantic coast, and is crossed by the river Cachoeira. It is not too far from the borders with the state of Paraná and its capital, Curitiba. The city is surrounded by the municipalities of Garuva, São Francisco do Sul, Araquari, Guaramirim, Schroeder, Jaraguá do Sul and Campo Alegre (this one in the microregion of São Bento do Sul).
The city contains a port on Babitonga Bay (Baía da Babitonga), which leads to the Atlantic Ocean and provides an important route for exporting manufactured products.
In 2006–07 there were public discussions about creating a Baía da Babitonga Wildlife Reserve to manage the mangroves, fishery and aquaculture in the bay.
This was defeated by politicians and businesspeople who were concerned about the impact on planned projects including a port expansion.
