Gornji Milanovac (Serbian Cyrillic: Гoрњи Милановац, pronounced [ɡôːrɲiː mǐlanoʋats] (listen)) is a town and municipality located in the Moravica District of central Serbia. The population of the town is 24,216, while the population of the municipality is 44,406.
The city was founded in 1853. Before 1859 the original name of the city was Despotovac, after the Despotovica river passing by the town. In 1859 the name was changed to Gornji Milanovac at the request of the Prince of Serbia Miloš Obrenović. Its name means Upper Milanovac (there is a Lower Milanovac as well, while Milanovac stems from the name Milan in Serbian).


== History ==
Initially, the settlement that was to become Gornji Milanovac (before 1853) was situated in the area of today's village Brusnica. There was some discussion about the suitability of the site for a settlement. The new municipality was to be called Despotovac after the river Despotovica which passes through this municipality (the river name originates from the Serbian despot, Đurađ Branković). On the 22nd of April 1852 Despotovac (later Gornji Milanovac) was then relocated to a place called Divlje Polje. This decision was taken by Mladen Žujović, Trivun Novaković, Stevan Knićanin, and Gaja Riznić. Notable buildings and roads (for example: "Zgrada starog suda – Old Court building") are the work of German engineer Indižir Schultz from Pančevo. Today's name Gornji Milanovac was formalized by the warrant of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia, in 1859, after his brother Milan Obrenović.

The location of Gornji Milanovac confirms that this area was settled in the prehistory and we can find settlements of Illyrians, Thracians, Dacians, small groups of Celts and Goths and bigger settlements of the Romans. On the mountain Rudnik, besides older miners grove there are remains of a Roman temple dedicated to the Terra Mater ("Mother Earth"). There is little information about Slavs and their settlements.
Even in the Middle Ages and the time of the Roman Empire, the area around Gornji Milanovac was significant in economical, agronomy, infrastructure and military sense. There are sites from the Neolithic period (in village Gojna Gora) and pre/post Roman governance period (Rudnik), also ruins and sites from Byzantine administration, Medieval Serbian Principality/Kingdom, Serbian Empire and Ottoman Empire  (on mountain Rudnik, in villages Brusnica, mountain Treska, Jablanica, and Gornji Milanovac parts of mountain Vujan ).
This town was significant during the First Serbian Uprising against Ottoman Empire rule, but more so during the 
Second Serbian Uprising. In 1814. at Takovo has reached a historical agreement about the Second Serbian Uprising. In front of the family house of Obrenović in the village Gornja Crnuća, he raised a flag (red Greek cross on the white background) and said:

Evo mene, a eto Vama rata s Turcima ( Here I'am, You have a war with the Turks)
In the World War I occupation, the population in Gornji Milanovac was subjected to war terror and crimes, while during World War II the infrastructure was destroyed and the population of this town suffered as before. At the time of sanctions and breakup of Yugoslavia, the industry of municipality exported their products to the Western and Eastern markets through offshore companies. In 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Gornji Milanovac was bombed once (only television repeater was damaged). People from nearby town and municipalities in joke said, that when NATO planned which town to bomb, they put a cup of coffee on the Gornji Milanovac place at the map.
