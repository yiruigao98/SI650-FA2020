== History ==


=== Prehistoric ===
The site of the city was already inhabited by Neolithic tribes who left hundreds of vestiges such as arrows, flint scrapers, polished axes... which have been recovered in the districts of Bouviers, Troux and Villaroy.


=== Antiquity ===
The civilization continued through Roman times, as Mr. Leclère, a farmer, demonstrated in a fortuitous way in 1892 by unearthing an antique ballot box in his field.


=== The religious life ===
Work to restore the church Saint-Victor put the date of the sarcophages at the Merovingian era (from the seventh century).  It is believed that the construction of the first church dates from the fourteenth century.  Several funerary vases and a tomb stone
dating from the sixteenth century were updated.  The church was renovated in the fifteenth century, then entirely rebuilt in the sixteenth century.  The most recent restoration goes back to 1998.


=== Guyancourt and the Palace of Versailles ===
Guyancourt forms part of the "Grand Parc" of the sun king Soleil (Louis XIV), which extended around the castle of Versailles.  The essential vocation of the populous communes neighbouring the castle is market-gardening, to provide for the important needs for the Court.


=== French revolution ===
Thanks to the register of grievances sent to the governmental authorities (1789), we know that Guyancourtois, who were mostly modest peasants, lived with difficulty under conditions of famine.


=== The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 ===
France is partly occupied by the Prussian armies. The enemy spreads terror, the houses are plundered, the inhabitants maltreated.  Four hundred of them (an enormous figure for the time) prefer to flee.


=== The 1900s ===
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Guyancourt was a large village where one cultivates corn, oats, beets, fodder and potatoes. The trades were numerous, with almost 16 wine merchants for 614 inhabitants.


==== First World War ====
The war of 1914–1918 cost the lives of thirty-six Guyancourtois.


==== Second World war ====
The war of 1939–1945 also touched Guyancourt, which was liberated by August 25, 1944.


==== The end of the twentieth century ====
Starting from the beginning of the 1950s, the Paris area saw a considerable demographic growth. To structure the development of the suburbs, it was decided to create several new towns around Paris, one of which being Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. The new city of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines includes today seven communes (eleven in the beginning), one of which is Guyancourt. In 1950 Guyancourt was only one small village. The commune grew  since 1970 to reach the figure of 27,000 inhabitants in 2004.
