== Geography ==
Giarre is bounded by the municipalities of Acireale, Mascali, Milo, Riposto, Sant'Alfio, Santa Venerina and Zafferana Etnea. It forms a conurbation with the coastal town of Riposto.

Since the late 16th century until 1815 Giarre was a village of the county of Mascali.
During the fascist era Giarre was joined to Riposto under the name of Jonia, but separated again in 1945.
