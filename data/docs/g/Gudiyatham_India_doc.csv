Gudiyatham (Tamil: [kuɖijaːttam]; also called Gudiyattam or Gudiyettram) is a Sub District and a historical town of Vellore district. It is a municipality in Vellore district in the state of Tamil Nadu in India. It is the most populated town in Vellore District before and after the separation of Tirupattur and Ranipet Districts. It lies between Bangalore and Chennai. District headquarters Vellore is 31 km away from the town. In 2011, the town had a population of 235,672. This is where the first Indian national flag was woven. Gudiyatham is a first-grade municipality. It was named Gudiyatham Municipality in 1886. The town is a match-box manufacturing and hand-looming centre. The occupation of the ancient town is artistic handloom weaving. The town is divided into four regions i.e., Gudiyatham east, Dakshina Patha Palem, west and south.
The town was built by Kulothunga Cholan during his reign. He named it as "Kudiyetra-nallur" which denotes a place suitable for good living.


== Etymology ==
Kulothunga Chola named the town "Jayamkonda Sathurvethi Mangalam". This was followed by rapid settlement of the town, so the town was renamed "Kudiyattrem", which metamorphosed into "Gudiyattam", to commemorate the influx. According to a myth, Karikala Cholan first cleared forest and then had people settle here, so it was named "Kudiyetram", which evolved into "Gudi-yetram". The supportive evidence for the myth is that the town is populated with one community who were of Chola kingdom. An inscription of 14th century found at Chenji (now in Cuddalore District) also reveals existence of the town in the name of “Gudi-yetram”. The passage of time and most probably British tongues changed the name to "Gudiyatham".


== History ==
The city was formerly created by Kulothunga Chola by extending lands. He named it "Jayamkonda Sathurvethi Mangalam". After a few years, many people settled in the town. Archeological excavation shows that the town flourished during Chola rule. Many Roman wine vases and coins were found in the town's periphery.

The town's existence is mentioned in the ancient inscription of Kulothunga Cholan's first regime in 1705 A.D. The town is surrounded by a good number of temples. The temple of Kappuleeswarar existed during the period of the Kulothunkkan 1st dynasty. During the regime, the king had denoted 90 ghots for maintenance and for purchase of oil for lighting. These inscriptions are found in the Kappuleeswarar temple Nandi Veeda inscription. The ancient temple was built at Nallore (Alias) Jayamkonda Sadurvedi Mangalam. The town was donated by the king, Kulothungan, following the victory in the Thondai Mandalam regions. The temple has been further modified and renovated by the Vijayanakara kings. The temple is a symbol of monuments of both Chola and Vijayanakara kingdoms.
The area around the Kappuleeswarar temple in ancient Nallore is now named Nellorepettai.
Sri Lakshmaiyah Chetty was a pioneer in developing the town who established a cloth store in 1850 which mainly sold handloom products such as sarees and lungis. He also encouraged people to weave handloom products and he was the first to export handloom items to northern India and was the first to import Kasi sarees.

The paintings of Pallava period are visible in the hills near Melmalaiyampattu village. The paintings of Jain statues were seen on the top of the naturally found cave structures.
