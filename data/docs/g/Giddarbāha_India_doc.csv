== Under British Rule ==
During that time, it took the shape of a town from the small village and when the Britishers reached here they wrongly pronounced the town name as Giddarbaha. They planned a new walled city in 1909 with six gates and carved the name on the gates as Giddarbaha. From there people accepted the name and started pronouncing the same.
In 1917, the British government established the Bathinda - Karachi railway line, to transport the goods from this part of India to Karachi.
