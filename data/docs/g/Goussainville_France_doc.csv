Goussainville is a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris, France. It is located 20.6 km (12.8 mi) north-northeast from the center of Paris, near Charles de Gaulle Airport.
Goussainville, together with the neighboring communes of Le Thillay and Vaudherland, form an urban area of 31,109 inhabitants (1999 census). This urban area is a satellite city of Paris, being separated from the urban area of Paris by some agricultural land. However, with the growth of the Paris suburbs, particularly around Charles de Gaulle Airport, it is expected that in the near future Goussainville will be reached by the suburbs of Paris, thus becoming physically linked to the urban area of Paris.
Goussainville was the site of the crash of the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144 during the 1973 Paris Air Show which led to the deaths of all six people on board and eight more on the ground and is less than 6 km from Gonesse, the site of the crash of the supersonic Concorde operating as Air France Flight 4590 on 25 July 2000.
In 1974, a year after the deadly Tupolev Tu-144 crash, Charles de Gaulle airport opened—putting the small commune directly in the flight path of the busy airport. The constant noise was a major disturbance and acted as a "constant remainder of the deadly crash."
