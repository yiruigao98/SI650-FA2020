== Background ==
As shown in the 1973 Automobile Association roads network, the Kwekwe–Gokwe road (then Que Que–Gokwe road) was a gravel one for about 99% of its present length. Only 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of the old Gokwe road was tarred from Kwekwe.


=== Reconstruction ===
The former gravel road was paved wide and tarred from 31 January 1986 to 31 March 1991.


== Operations ==
The original plan was to construct a 7-metre-wide (23 ft) carriageway with two 1.5-metre (4.9 ft) shoulders.  The road is however 6 metres (20 ft) with 2 0.5-metre (1.6 ft) shoulders constructed according to the revised plan of 1986.

The rivers are Kwekwe River, Rhino River, Chimwamombe River, Sesombe River, Mandombe River, Somalala River, Ngazimbi River, Zhombe River, Gwenzi River, Sehozana River, Little Sehozana River, Ufafi River and the Ngondoma River.

== Economic viability ==
There has been improved economic and business growth in areas served by the road over the years. Both Zhombe Joel and Gokwe have experienced economic growth because of the impact of the feeder road.


== Road traffic statistics ==
Although there is no railway line to Gokwe, the road network, courtesy of the main R847 Kwekwe-Gokwe, has proved excellent. Road vehicles of all kinds and sizes are increasing just as in bigger towns and cities.
According to the project performance evaluation report of the Zimbabwe Rural Roads Project number 1, the flow of vehicles of all sizes in 1984 had an average of 131 per day. In 1991, when the tarred road was opened, the flow of such vehicles rose to 212 with a marked increase of heavy vehicles and buses. By 2011, the flow of vehicles was as high as 660 per day, with heavy goods vehicles topping the list at an average of 321 per day.
Unlike other Zimbabwean highways, the R847 has no toll gates, but the flow of vehicles on the road per day has since doubled the 2011 averages, according to statistics elsewhere on major highways. In past years, the annual average daily traffic was done by traffic recording devices or by human observers who visually had to count and record traffic on tally sheets. However, at the fall of the Zimbabwean dollar the manned system was dropped only to come up later in the form of the toll gates system, which count vehicles by weight and generate revenue at the same time. The Kwekwe–Gokwe Highway is yet to have a toll gate.
The increase of heavy vehicles spells the growth of business in Gokwe, Zhombe and other centers in the north-eastern parts of Matabeleland North Province.


== Beneficiaries ==


=== Settlements ===
The chief beneficiary of the R847 is Gokwe, which has become the newest town in Zimbabwe credit to the Kwekwe–Gokwe Highway.Zhombe Joel, CMB Nemangwe and Kabuyuni-Chitekete growth points have also grown to suburban standards.
Empress Mine and Columbina Township though in link roads are beneficiaries too.


=== Vehicle operators ===
Road traffic users and vehicle owners have also benefited from the R847 bitumen highway in terms of vehicle operating cost savings.
According to the project performance evaluation report of the Zimbabwe Rural Roads Project number 1, in 1984 the total savings on "vehicle operating costs" for all sizes of vehicles that used the Kwekwe-Gokwe Road was $4,084,244 for 212 vehicles; an average of about $19,265 per vehicle. As per this same cost benefit analysis in 2010, nine years after the opening of the Kwekwe-Gokwe Highway, overall vehicle operating costs for 660 vehicles was $11,384,880; an average of $17,250 per vehicle, a reduction of about $2,000 per vehicle.
