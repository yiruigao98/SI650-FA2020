Giulianova (Giuliese: Gigljië [ˈdʒiʝʝə]) is a coastal town and comune in the province of Teramo, Abruzzo region, Italy. The comune also has city (Italian: città) status, thus also known as Città di Giulianova.


== Geography ==
The town lies in the north of the Abruzzo region, between the Salinello and the Tordino rivers. Giulianova is split between the Paese, the historic town up in the hills, and the lido, the more recent development down by the beach.
Tourism plays a big part in the town's economy. The town, characterized by several beaches, is a summer retreat for people from large cities like Rome and Milan, as well as German and French tourists.


== History ==
In pre-Roman times, the Praetutii tribe had a settlement there. In 3rd century BCE Romans established a colony called Castrum Novum in the vicinity of Giulianova. In the Middle Ages, the old Castrum Novum was called Castrum divi Flaviani, and remained an important trade and travel hub, until it was destroyed in 1460, during the Tordino Battle. The local baron Giulio Antonio Acquaviva, founded, in 1471, a new city up on the hill, not far from the older one, calling its Giulia. It was an interesting example of renaissance ideal city, applying the theory of the most important architects of the time, as Leon Battista Alberti and Francesco Di Giorgio Martini, with the cultural environment of whom, he was in contact.
