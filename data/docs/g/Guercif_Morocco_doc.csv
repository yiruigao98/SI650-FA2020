Allal bin Abdullah was born in the city of Jarsif, in the Hawara tribe of Rahu.
He moved to Rabat after the provocations of one of the colonizers' agents, and he settled in the Akkari neighborhood, and he established relations with a number of traders in the city, its men, and its citizens. On Friday, September 11, 1953, he headed towards the motorcade of Al-Sattan Muhammed bin Arafa who was heading towards the People of Fez Mosque to perform Friday prayers. Allal bin Abdullah drove in a gray "Ford" car to the Sultan's motorcade with a knife in his hand to stab him. However, an officer threw him at his door, and at the same moment, a group of undercover policemen fired 8 bullets at Allal bin Abdullah.
This process had a major impact on increasing the attacks of the resistance against French protection, as commando operations continued, and the liberation army sparked in the north of the country on October 1, 1955 and spread all over the country, until the return of Sultan Mehmed V from exile.
In the following year, during the commemoration of the King and People's Revolution, Sultan Baal bin Abdullah praised:
“We have shown, except that today we show our care by removing the curtain on the memorial plaque located in the place where the late Allal bin Abdullah fell, the heroic hero who demonstrated that the throne is emanating from the heart of the Moroccan people, and that he is from his entity and ensuring his presence and sovereignty, so he will redeem him. And redeem the nation embodied in his spirit, until he fell in the field of honor in a hurry, leaving for generations the greatest examples of sacrifice, jealousy and good loyalty. ”»
The resistance, Sheikh Al-Arab, later assassinated the security man, Quiza Lasorti, who was accused of killing Allal. In 2012, the Alal bin Abdullah frigate entered the Moroccan Royal Navy fleet.
