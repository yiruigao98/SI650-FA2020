== History ==
Grimma is of Sorbian origin and was first documented in 1065. The Margraves of Meissen and the Electors of Saxony often resided at the castle in the town.
The city was chosen as one of three government elite boarding schools, the 'Princely Schools of Saxony', in 1550. The purpose of these schools was to educate future civil servants and to prepare them for further studies at universities which is why a number of historical personalities are biographically related to this rather small city. The Gymnasium St. Augustine still exists today as one of only a few public boarding schools in Saxony.
Grimma was the scene of witch trials between 1494–1701. At least two women were executed as witches.Due to the city being located at the second main railway line between Leipzig and Dresden (via Meissen), the city developed well in the 19th century.
By 1890 the population had reached 8,957.The city was affected by heavy flooding in 2013.   Work had by this time started on the construction of flood barriers, but their completion had been delayed by local opposition 


== Culture ==
Grimma has been the site of many historic structures, including a town hall dating from 1442, a famous school (the Fürstenschule) erected on the site of a former Augustinian monastery in 1550, and a school of brewing.
