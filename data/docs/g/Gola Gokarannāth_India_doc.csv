== Mythological significance ==
During the great war of Ramayana in Treta Yuga Ravana pleased Lord Shiva with his penance so that he could win the war against Lord Rama. Lord Shiva took the shape of a Shiv-ling and directed him to install that Shiva-ling in Lanka. But Lord Shiva proposed the condition that Shiv-Ling should not be put on the Earth on its way to Lanka. But on the way back, Ravana had to give the Shiva-ling to a shepherd to attend nature's call. Shiva increased the weight of the Shiva-ling, so the shepherd had to give up and put the Ling on the ground. This made Ravana very angry as he understood the trickery of Lord Shiva. Ravana realised that Lord Shiva did not want the Ling to be carried to Lanka and let Ravana win the war. Enraged Ravana pressed the Ling with his thumb resulting in an impression which looked like a cow's ear (गौ-कर्ण). It is on this basis that the place was named Gola Gokaran Nath.

Gola is home to one of the most prominent sugar mills in Asia. Bajaj Hindusthan Limited is situated in the northern part.

The original capacity of the factory was 400 tons of cane crushed per day (TCD). Subsequently, this capacity was increased in stages and is currently 13,000 TCD. The distillery unit at this plant commenced production during the end of World War II in 1944. In the initial few years, the major output was in the form of power alcohol as an additive to petrol, which was then in short supply. The unit was the first to supply alcohol-mixed petrol to the army.
