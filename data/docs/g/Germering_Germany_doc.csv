== History ==
The area of 
Germering has an old history attested by findings of burial mounds of the New Stone Age and the Bronze Age, as well as a "villa rustica" (as in nearby Leutstetten) built by the Romans. There was a trade route through the city with numerous brick kilns. After their discovery a glass roof was erected over one (near the Nebelerstrasse) so one can still view it.
Germering was first reliably mentioned about 859-864 A.D. In those days it was still known as Kermeringon, but apparently it was formerly mentioned under the name Germana vel admonte. Unterpfaffenhofen, the south-west part of Germering, was first named in a charter dated 1190, but both villages remained small and rural until they experienced several significant increases in population during the 20th century.
During World War II, a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp was located in the town.In 1978, the two independent towns Unterpfaffenhofen and Germering were merged to form present-day Germering. The new city coat of arms was created in 1981 by Karl Haas, who incorporated the coats of arms of both former boroughs.
