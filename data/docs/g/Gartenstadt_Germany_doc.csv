The station was opened in 1918 by the name "Hinschenfelde" and as part of Hamburg's Walddörferbahn. In 1920 the station was electrified, renamed "Wandsbek-Gartenstadt" and integrated into the Hamburger Hochbahn network. On 4 August 1963 the second rail line was opened.
Since 2014, ongoing modernization works on the station building and the station platforms are underway, including raised platforms for handicap-accessibility and new platform roofs. Since May 2014, the northbound trains are accessible via an elevator, the southbound trains are expected to be equipped accordingly by the end of 2014.

The station is located on the northern side of Ostpreußenplatz, a small square off Lesserstraße. The two elevated island platforms sit on a rail dam, with main access from a small station building on the southern side, and a pedestrian tunnel on the north side. The station allows for cross-platform interchange between the two lines.
