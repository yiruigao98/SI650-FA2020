== Kuixing Tower ==
Kuixing Tower is a historic tower in Guangshui.  Built in 1377, the tower stands on a hill overlooking the city. Kuixing is the name of a god who is said to live in the constellation of Ursa Major and who governs literature and writing.  As Guangshui is a city known for its calligraphy, the connection to Kuixing is apparent. According to legend, many great poets studied in Guangshui, and Li Bai's famous poem called 'A Tranquil Night' was written there.A Tranquil Night
A bed, I see a silver light,
I wonder if it's frost aground.
Looking up, I find the moon bright;
Bowing, in homesickness I'm drowned.
Traditionally, parents whose children are attending college entrance examinations go there to pray and burn incense.
