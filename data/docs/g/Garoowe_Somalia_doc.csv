Garowe (Somali: Garoowe, Arabic: غاروي‎, Italian: Garoe) is the capital of Nugaal region and administrative capital of Puntland state in northeastern Somalia.
Garowe is situated in the Nugaal Valley, bounded by gradually ascending high plateaus that generally reach elevations of 500 to 1,000 metres (1,600 to 3,300 feet) above sea level on the north, west, and south. The western part of the same plateau is crossed by numerous valleys and dry watercourses. Goat and camel raising form the basis of the economy, and frankincense and myrrh are collected from wild trees.


== History ==

During the 19th century, Garowe and much of northeastern Somalia were an integral part of the Majeerteen Sultanate, ruled by Boqor Osman Mahamud, cousin of Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo.

The city would later be incorporated into Italian Somaliland during the colonial period.
Following independence, Garowe was made a district center of Bosaso. The city would subsequently be reassigned in the early 1970s as the regional capital of an area consisting of Las Anod and Eyl. Straddling the Nugal Valley, this new administrative division would be named Nugal.Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, a homegrown constitutional conference was held in Garowe in 1998 over a period of three months. Attended by the area's political elite, traditional elders (Issims), members of the business community, intellectuals and other civil society representatives, the autonomous Puntland State of Somalia was subsequently officially established so as to deliver services to the population, offer security, facilitate trade, and interact with both domestic and international partners.
