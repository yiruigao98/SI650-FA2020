== History ==
It was originally called Ginosa Scalo for the presence of the railway station. It was also known as Stornara, because of the common starling many of which return in autumn, or Twenty-five for the location of the toll-booth at km 25 of the former SS580 (i.e. at its end) and the signalling control number.
In 1956 the village was given the official designation of Marina di Ginosa by the then President of the Republic.
Today Marina di Ginosa has a larger urban fabric than Ginosa City and it has a permanent population of about 5,000. Marina di Ginosa was severely hit by a flood in the night from 1 to 2 March 2011.
