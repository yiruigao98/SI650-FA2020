Gioia del Colle (pronounced [ˈdʒɔːja del ˈkɔlle]; Barese: Sciò) is a town and comune of the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy. The town is located on the Murge plateau at 360 metres (1,180 ft) above sea level. Between Adriatic and Ionian Sea.


== History ==
The earliest evidence of human settlement in the area now known as Gioia del Colle dates back to the 9th century BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed that at that time a Peucetian village was located in the area of Monte Sannace, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) from Gioia).
Monte Sannace site, 5 km away from the town in the direction of Turi, has been the subject of archaeological excavations since 1957 by the Superintendency of Antiquities in Apulia and Matera. 
The excavations, completed in 1961, have brought to light a settlement of the ancient Peucetian village dating back to the 9th century BC and which continues, with brief interruptions, until the Hellenistic-Roman period (approximately until the first century AD).
The archaeological park includes some sections of the defensive circuits and the north gate, in addition to a good part of the town, numerous tombs and several buildings of the acropolis. The archaeological area is located at 4.5 kilometres from the provincial road "Gioia del Colle - Turi" (SP 61).
The finds from the excavations are preserved in the National Archaeological Museum located inside the Norman-Swabian Castle.
The current town developed around an old Byzantine fortress. The placename, in fact, seems to derive from Joha, short for the surname Joannakis, a Byzantine family living in the area during the Middle Ages. However, there are many theories regarding the origin of this placename. One of the most famous local legends has it that Princess Bianca Lancia irretrievably lost all her jewels there, after being supposedly confined in the Castle of Gioia del Colle during her pregnancy with her son Manfred of Sicily under the suspicion of having been unfaithful to Frederick II. 
The town grew further in the 12th century, during the time of Norman Count Richard of Hauteville, who built the castle. In the 13th century the fief was under the rule of Frederick II of Swabia, who rebuilt the castle.
Gioia del Colle was part of the principality of Taranto and a fief of the princes De Mari of Acquaviva delle Fonti until the abolition of feudalism.

=== Castle ===
The Castle of Gioia del Colle was built in the 12th century, during the time of Norman Count Riccardo Siniscalco d'Altavilla, the first tenant of the fief. Destroyed by William I of Sicily, the castle was rebuilt in 1230 by Emperor Frederick II after his return from the Crusades.  The castle was then completed by the Angevins, who created windows in the curtain wall.
According to Bonaventura da Lama (who quoted the historian Pantaleo) Bianca Lancia was confined in this castle while pregnant with Manfred of Sicily, on suspicion of having been unfaithful to Frederick II. In fact, on the wall of a cell (which is likely to have been the princess') are carved shapes, which, according to a local legend, are intended to represent her breasts, which she cut off in pain at being so humiliated. After giving birth, she sent the alleged illegitimate child to the emperor on a silver platter together with her breasts.  
The later owners between 1600 and 1800 (the Acquaviva d'Aragona family, the De Mari and Donna Maria Emanuela Caracciolo) changed the castle appearance into a residential one.
