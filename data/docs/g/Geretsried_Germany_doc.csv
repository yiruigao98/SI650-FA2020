== History ==
Geretsried was first mentioned in the year 1083. In the early years it served a little more than a group of farms along the postal route between Munich and Innsbruck. It belonged to the city of Wolfratshausen.
In 1937 two munitions factories were built: "Dynamit Aktien Gesellschaft" and "Deutsche Sprengchemie" in the boroughs of what is today Gartenberg and Stein. Towards the end of the war, these factories employed slave and foreign labourers. Today, the remains of storage bunkers, administrative buildings, and other remains are scattered throughout the town. In May 1945 the American air force bombed the factories.
In 1946, the empty bunkers and buildings were used to house German refugees from former ethnic German areas in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the citizens began to organize themselves and on April 1, 1950 the community of Geretsried came into being. On June 27, 1970, Geretsried got city rights.
