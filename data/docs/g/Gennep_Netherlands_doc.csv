== The city of Gennep ==
Gennep was the title of a comital family, known descendants of which are the famous Saint Norbert of Gennep and William of Gennep, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne.
Gennep probably received city rights in 1371. However, it remains unclear whether these city rights have really been assigned to Gennep, as the supposed documents burned during a fire in the townhall of Gennep at the end of the 16th century. 
Gennep lies about 18 kilometres (11 miles) southeast of Nijmegen.
In 2001, Gennep had 8306 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 2.11 square kilometres (0.81 sq mi), and contained 3124 residences.
