== History ==


=== Etymology ===
Takapes, the ancient name of Gabès, is a Numidian (Berber) toponym. Later, the prefix "Ta" (meaning "to" in Berber) was dropped, and the place became known as Kapes. As in Arabic the sound /p/ is unknown, Kapes became known as Kabes, and later known as Gabès.


=== Roman period ===
Gabès is the ancient Tacapae or Tacape (Τακάπη in Ancient greek)  or Tacapes of the Roman province of Tripolitania.
Strabo refers to this city as an important entrepot of the Lesser Syrtis. Pliny (18.22) remarks that the waters of a copious fountain at Tacape were divided among the cultivators according to a system where each had the use of the water during a certain interval of time.
The Tabula Peutingeriana shows Tacape between Marcomades  and Sabratha.


=== Bishopric ===
Tacapae became a Christian bishopric that, no longer being a residential see, is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Three of its bishops are known:
Dulcitius, legate of the bishops of Tripolitana to the Council of Carthage (403) and present at the Conference of Carthage (411);
Servilius, exiled by Huneric in 484;
Caius or Gallus, legate of the bishops of his province to the Council of Carthage (525).
