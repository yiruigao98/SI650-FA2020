Glyfada (Greek: Γλυφάδα, pronounced [ɣliˈfaða]) is a suburb in South Athens located in the Athens Riviera. It is situated in the southern parts of the Athens' Urban Area. The area stretches from the foot of the Hymettus mountain to the Saronic Gulf. It is the largest of Athens' southern suburbs.


== History ==
In ancient times, the area was a deme known as Aixone (Αἰξωνή). Today, Glyfada is packed with some of the capital's best-known nightclubs, upscale restaurants and shops. It could be argued to be  one of the most "Americanized" of Athenian municipalities, since an American airbase was located nearby until the early 1990s. The base's population  contributed in part to  Glyfada's character, leading to a unique blend of Greek and American atmosphere and cuisine. Although the base is now gone and the school relocated, Glyfada still retains part of its American flavour while continuing to offer distinctly Greek cuisine, entertainment and nightlife.
Glyfada was established as the heart of Athens' southern suburbs, because of its prime waterfront location, rich commercial centre, and modern business district. It has been described  as  the headpoint of the 'Athens Riviera' and  features some of Europe's most opulent seafront residences, gardens and extensive beachfront property, with a modern marina.
The town hall is located at the center of the municipality; nearby, Glyfada's shopping district has one of the most vibrant and diversified commercial centres of Athens' neighbourhoods, with a collection ranging across specialist and  designer boutiques. Its proximity to a succession of beaches and a concentrated seaside club scene also greatly increases the number of visitors during the summer months. The area's shopping district runs across Metaxa Avenue and Grigoriou Labraki Street while both the offices of major businesses and shopping areas also dot the Avenues Vouliagmenis, Gounari and Gennimata.
At the beginning of the 20th century the town had already changed its name to "Glyfada", a name given because of the presence of salt-water wells typical of this area.


== Geography ==
The municipality has an area of 25.366 km2 and it is located in the Athens Riviera. Glyfada Marina includes marine space and coastal land area totaling 3 kilometres (2 miles), and a concrete land mass between basins A and B with a length of roughly 250 metres (820 feet), between basins B and G with a length of roughly 150 metres (490 feet), between basins G and D with a length of roughly 300 metres (980 feet), and between basin D until the end of the basin of roughly 350 metres (1,150 feet), with all harbor facilities and buildings found within this space.
Northwest is the golf course of Athens, the Glyfada Golf Club, located south of the former Ellinikon Airport. To the east and northeast is an urban sprawl which spreads over the southwest shoulder of Mt. Hymettus and its rocky landscape.
