According to the 1911 British publication The Imperial Gazetteer of India:

The town [Gangoh] consists of an old and new quarter, the former founded by a legendary hero. Raja Gang, from whom its name is derived, and the latter by the famous saint Shaikh Abdul Kuddus, who gives his title to the western suburb, where his mausoleum stands, built by Humayun in 1537 and Molana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi which was co-founder of madrasa darul-aloom Deuband and participated in war against East India Company under the flag of Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki. During the Mutiny Gangoh was frequently threatened by the rebel Gurjars (Gujjars) under the self-styled Raja Fathua; but Mr. H. D. Robertson and Lieutenant Boisragon attacked and utterly defeated them towards the end of June, 1857. There are three old mosques, two of which were built by Akbar and Jahangir, besides a school and a dispensary. The town is liable to be flooded from a large swamp south of the site, but a scheme has been prepared to drain this. The streets are paved and most of them have brickwork drains. Gangoh is administered under Act XX of 1856, the income raised being about Rs. 3,000 a year. It is the cleanest and best kept of all the towns under Act XX in the District.
