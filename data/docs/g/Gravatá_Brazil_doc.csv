== History ==

The municipal district of Gravatá had its origins in a farm, which in 1808, belonging to José Justino Carreiro de Miranda, served as a lodging place for travellers and sold mainly sugar and beef. Travelling along the river Ipojuca from Recife towards the inside of the country was difficult in those times. The merchants were forced to make strategic stops to avoid the cattle losing weight. One of those resting-places was known as "Crauatá", derived from the Tupi name "Karawata" (mato que fura) for the place, due to the predominance of a plant belonging to the family of the bromélias, also called Caraguatá, Caroatá, Caróa and Gravatá.
It was at the end of the 18th century, that José Justino Carreio de Miranda took ownership of the Fazenda Gravatá, which for a long time served as lodging for travelers. As a natural consequence, on the two sides of the river two populations developed. In 1810 the construction of the chapel Sant'Ana was started to be completed 12 years later by João Félix Justiniano, the son of José Justino Carreiro de Miranda.
Soon afterwards, the grounds were divided in 100 lots and sold to the residents, leading off the town of Gravatá (Cidade de Gravatá), being a district of the municipal district Bezerros. In 1875, the freguesia was created, and on May 30, 1881 Gravatá became a town (municipio) due to the Law provincial no. 1.560 (Lei Provicial n°. 1.560), and the former chapel was transformed to a mother church. On June 13, 1884, the main place of the municipal district was elevated to the category of a city (Lei Provicial n° 1.805). However, political emancipation only came to happen after the Proclamation the Republic. by the Organic Act of the Municipal district of March 15, 1893, when the city's municipality gained autonomy and elected its first mayor, Antonio Avelino do Rêgo Barros.
In the end of the 19th century, with the inauguration of the Great Westerns Railways, linking Recife to the interior from Pernambuco, the city took considerable pulse and, little by little, vocation was defined for tourism, above all with the construction of the road BR-232, in the Mountains of Russians (Serra das Russas).


=== The Great Westerns Railways ===
The railroad between Recife and Gravatá was built in the years 1881 to 1894. The biggest problem in this project was the mountainous landscape around Gravatá, so that it was necessary to construct a lot of bridges and tunnels. The Grota Funda bridge e.g. has a length of 180 m (591 ft) and a height of 48 m (157 ft). In the years 1945 to 1947 the railroad was reconditioned: the iron bridges were replaced by ferroconcrete bridges. In 1986 the railroad was cited for the breathtaking landscape around.
The importance of the railroad is caused by the development of the interior from Pernambuco: now it was possible to transfer goods and people in a reasonable time and in big quantities. This caused an economic upswing in the interior, because of a strengthening of trade and tourism.
