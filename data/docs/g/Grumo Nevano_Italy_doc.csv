Grumo Nevano is an Italian comune (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Naples  in the Italy, Campania region, with 17 939 inhabitants.


== Physical Geography ==
Neighbouring Province of Caserta and located 11 km north of the Metropolitan City of Naples, is an urban municipality of the Campana lowland. It is made up of the two areas (not frazioni) of Grumo and Nevano, united by the urban planning for two centuries and under the administrative one since the XX century. Grumese territory stands between 44 and 66 m above sea level.


== History ==
The name of Grumo comes from the latin grumum, meaning "cluster" or "heap" (of houses), whereas the name of Nevano comes from praedium naevianum, which was a property of gens Naevia.
Before 1863 Grumo and Nevano were two different farmhouses: Grumo included the southern area of the municipality (up to San Tammaro's Basilica) whereas Nevano included the northern area. In 1700 maps it appeared as Grumi.
Grumo Nevano, like all the other municipalities in the northern area of Naples, has osca origins. Some Samnite graves were casually found inside the residential area during 60s and 70s and two latin inscriptions are witnessed, probably coming from Atella.
