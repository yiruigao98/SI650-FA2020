Granja Comary football complex is the headquarters and main training center of the Brazil national football team, which is managed by the Brazilian Football Confederation. It is located in the Granja Comary neighborhood in the Brazilian city of Teresópolis, Rio de Janeiro, and occupies an area of 149,000 m2 (1,600,000 sq ft) with 8,500 m2 (91,000 sq ft) of built area. It was opened on 31 January 1987.The facility was purchased by the Brazilian Football Confederation in 1978, and inaugurated in 1987, serving as the headquarters for Brazil's preparations in four FIFA World Cups between 1990 and 2010,  except for 2006 when the squad players started their training in Europe. For the 2014 FIFA World Cup, hosted by Brazil, CBF spent over R$15m (US$6.7m) reforming Granja Comary so it would again be the national team's headquarters during the tournament.

The place is composed of five football fields, including an Act Global FIFA Certified field.
