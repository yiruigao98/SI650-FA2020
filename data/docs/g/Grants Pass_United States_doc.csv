== History ==
Early Hudson's Bay Company hunters and trappers, following the Siskiyou Trail, passed through the site beginning in the 1820s. In the late 1840s, settlers (mostly American) following the Applegate Trail began traveling through the area on their way to the Willamette Valley. The city states that the name was selected to honor General Ulysses S. Grant's success at Vicksburg.  The Grants Pass post office was established on March 22, 1865. The city of Grants Pass was incorporated in 1887.The Oregon–Utah Sugar Company, financed by Charles W. Nibley, was created, leading to a sugar beet factory being built in Grants Pass in 1916. Before the factory opened, Oregon-Utah Sugar was merged into the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. Due to labor shortages and low acreage planted in sugar beets, the processing machinery was moved to Toppenish, Washington, in 1918 or 1919.Grants Pass is one of many cities in Oregon that is marked by a racist history. Grants Pass, along with Medford and Ashland was an unofficial "sundown town", which actively warned Black and other non-white people to leave town before sunset or face violence and harassment. Although there was no documented law of the racist policy, it was enforced locally via residents and signage.
