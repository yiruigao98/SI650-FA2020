== History ==
The total area of Gudalur and the neighboring town of Pandalur is approximately 124,800 acres. In medieval times, before the arrival of the British, the area was divided between three rulers: Vallavanoor, the leader of the Panniyas, Nelliarasi, another adivasi ruler, and the Nilambur Kovilagam, a kingdom based in present-day Kerala. Subsequently, the Kovilagam decided to expand its borders by conquering the other two areas. Vallavanoor was killed and Nelliarasi kidnapped and forced to hand over her lands. Despite some resistance from Vallavanoor's community, the Kovilagam succeeded in subjugating the area and taking approximately 100,000 acres under its control. Gudalur was actually a part of Kerala and Malabar District until 1877. In 1877, it was transferred to Nilgiris district only because of the heavy size of Malabar District and small size of Nilgiris district. Actually Gudalur was the southeastern region in Wayanad during the British rule. Though this Malayalam majority region was transferred to Nilgiris, the court and official language in this region continued to be Malayalam.  In modern times, the recognized extent of the Kovilagam's holdings was 80,087 acres under the Malabar Tenancy Act, until 1969. This area is known as 'janmom' land. Kovilagam constructed a temple named Nambalakottai and handed over to Moundadan Chetty community. Chetty community is one of the oldest community in Gudalur where most of their community still have 'Rani Patta' as a proof of oldest community. They have their own tradition and languages.

Proposal for a new route to join Gudalur with Sathyamangalam is in consideration. This route helps Gudalurites to reach plains like Erode and Coimbatore without travelling in mountainous roads and quicker than the usual route Gudalur - Ooty- Coonoor - Mettupalayam. This new route is an undeveloped path which connects Gudalur -Theppakkad - Siriyur- Thengumarahada-Bhavanisagar - Sathyamangalam on the banks of river Moyar. This route lies in the middle of Mudumalai - Sathyamangalam Forest. Forest department of Tamil Nadu government concerns about wildlife and bio-reserve of this region does not allow any deforestation activities like cutting of trees to lay new roads.
Proposal for construction of railway which connects Nanjangudu (Karnataka) with Nilambur (Kerala) Via Gudalur (Tamil Nadu) Nilambur-Nanjangud line is also in consideration. This new train route would shorten around 450 km in travelling distance to reach Kanyakumari from  Bangalore (Bengaluru - Mysuru - Nanjangudu - Gudalur - Nilambur - Shoranur - Trivandrum - Kanyakumari). But The route is now disjoint at two railway stations at Nanjangudu and Nilambur. Again the concern of forest department restrict the idea of construction of railway road in the mid forest of Nilgiris (Mudumalai-Muthanga-Bandipur).
