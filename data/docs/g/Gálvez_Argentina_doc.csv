== Description ==
The circuit is located in a park in the southern part of the city, and is situated on flat lands surrounded by large grandstands, giving most spectators an excellent view area of the whole circuit. Some races were run without the twisty infield section, reducing lap times significantly.
The 1000 km Buenos Aires sports car event used the Autódromo as well as sections of highway situated near the track from 1954 to 1960.  The 1000 km event would return again from 1970 to 1972, but using just the Autódromo section.
The 20 Formula One Argentine Grand Prix races were held in the Autódromo between 1953 and 1998. Formula One used a number of different configurations—the No.2 circuit was used from 1954–1960, the No.9 circuit was used from 1971–1973, and the very fast No.15 layout was used from 1974–1981 which added 2 long straights and a long third corner between the two straights often taken in top gear totally flat out, which provided an exciting view for spectators, especially when the cars exited the third corner often on the brink of spinning off or crashing at 305 km/h. Going through that section, the cars were flat out for 40 seconds. The Argentine Grand Prix was dropped from the 1982 calendar because of Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands and Carlos Reutemann's sudden retirement after the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix. The twisty No.6 configuration was used from 1995–1998, but that version of the circuit was not popular with Formula One, and after the 1998 race there was no money for the race to be held and it was dropped.
Ten Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix race were held in the Autódromo between 1961 and 1999.
The Buenos Aires Grand Prix was held in the Autódromo from 1952 to 2009.
