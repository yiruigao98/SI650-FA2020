=== 2014–2016: Bishouné: Alma del Huila ===
On February 4, 2014, Garzon-Montano's Bishouné: Alma del Huila was released in conjunction with Styles Upon Styles, a Brooklyn based recording label. The extended play's title derives from his family heritage as Bishouné is a phonetic spelling of a childhood nickname his French mother called him, and Alma del Huila is a name for the Colombian municipality of Garzón, his father's last name. The 6-track extended play was Garzón-Montano's first release, and contained songs including "6 8" which had been written several years earlier. Garzón-Montano created tracks in GarageBand and would later record with Henry Hirsch at Waterfront Studios in Hudson, New York, where he played all the instruments to be tracked directly to 2-inch tape. After the project was completed, he pressed 500 vinyl copies of Bishouné with the indie label, which distributed it door-to-door to record stores in New York City. Singer Mayer Hawthorne heard the EP in a local record store and sent the album to Stones Throw Records which created the connection with the label for Garzon-Montano's next album. Lenny Kravitz invited Garzón-Montano to open his Strut 2014 European stadium tour. While Garzón-Montano was on tour in Europe, he received a message from long time friend Zoë Kravitz about Drake using his track "6 8". What ultimately resulted was "Jungle" off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late Later collaborations resulted in the singer working with British pop singer Eliza Doolittle. Garzón-Montano performed at Central Park's Summerstage as well as Lollapalooza in 2015, followed by another festival appearance at Estéreo Picnic Festival in Bogota, Colombia in 2016.


=== 2017–present: Jardín and Agüita ===
On January 27, 2017, Garzón-Montano released his debut studio album, Jardín, with Stones Throw Records. The album was supported by three single releases, "Sour Mango", "The Game", and "Crawl". The title of the album is a reference to his own heritage and language as it is spelled interchangeably between French and Spanish. Jardín, like his previous release, was recorded onto 2-inch tape to achieve the organic sound throughout the album. Imagery of fruit and plant life are components of the lyrics from "Sour Mango" to the cactus in "Crawl", as well as in sequences in "Fruitflies". Since the album's release, videos for the songs "Crawl" and "My Balloon" have been uploaded through Stones Throw. Garzón-Montano performed several showcases at SXSW in conjunction with entities such as Urban Outfitters and KCRW-Los Angeles. Jardín was a frequent feature of American Radio Station NPR. Garzón-Montano released an instrumental version of Jardín on September 22 on Stones Throw Records. Garzón-Montano announced a tour of Australia and Asia during the fall of 2017, as well as a performance at Tropico Festival in Acapulco, MX. In 2020, Gabriel Garzón-Montano announced and released his sophomore album, "Agüita". He described the album as "anti-genre" with him flirting with many diverse sounds including reggaeton, art rock, trap, hip hop, urbano, electronica, post-punk, folk and ambient music alongside the usual offerings of soul, funk and alternative R&B.


== Musical influences ==
Garzón-Montano mentions musical influencers such as Prince (whom Jardín is dedicated to), Stevie Wonder, Sly & The Family Stone, Marvin Gaye, The Beatles, and Radiohead.
