Portuguesa State (Spanish: Estado Portuguesa, IPA: [esˈtaðo poɾtuˈɣesa]) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela.  Located in the west of the Republic, it is considered the "breadbasket of Venezuela" for the large amount of agricultural products produced there. The state is bordered on the north by the state of Lara, on the east by Cojedes, on the west by Trujillo and south by Barinas.
As of the 2011 census, it had a population of 876,496. The state government is located in the city of Guanare, founded in 1591.


== Toponymy ==
The state was designated with that name as of August 4, 1909. According to the apologist, it is due to the tragic outcome of a young woman of Portuguese origin who drowned in the waters of the old and mighty Temerí River; she possibly accompanied the conquistadors who founded what we know today as the city of Guanare, the capital of the state. As a result of this event, the people who identify the river and the state are now known.


== History ==


=== Pre-Colombian era ===
In the pre-Hispanic era, the territory of the Venezuelan plains was inhabited by groups that arrived from the Amazon region by river (probably Colombia or Ecuador).
The oldest known occupation occurred between 300 and 600 BC in the Barinas and Portuguesa plains, perhaps because it was one of the least affected by periodic flooding in the region.
Over the next 1200 years, these communities moved northwards from Venezuela and were also influenced by groups from the Orinoco. Among the traces left by these pre-Colombian inhabitants are numerous petroglyphs of geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, as well as a complex network of roads believed to have served to drain swamps or control water. They also left a system of mounds that possibly had functions of surveillance, funerary or refuge for the periods of greatest flooding.


=== Spanish colonization ===
Several expeditions of the Welser of Augsburg, coming from Coro under the command of Nicolas Federmann and Georg von Spira, towards the year 1534 went to the Andean foothills and crossed the current territory of the Llanos.
In 1542, the armies of Philip von Hutten from Coro visited the region on their way to Barinas, but were rejected by the Omaguas Indians and Hutten was wounded.
The Spanish conquerors Diego Ruiz de Vallejo and Juan Ruiz de Villegas started in 1549 the exploration of the lands located in the east of the Andes. Decades later, on November 3, 1591, Juan Fernandez de Leon founded Espiritu Santo of the Guanaguanare Valley, today's Guanare. Its name in indigenous language means 'Place of seagulls' and also, 'Land between rivers'.


=== 19th century ===
Among the warlike actions undertaken by Bolivar from the west in the War of Independence, the Battle of Araure stands out, in which Simon Bolivar defeated Jose Ceballos. With Santiago Mariño from the east, Venezuela was under the control of the patriots in mid 1813, except for the provinces of Guayana and Maracaibo. In September 1813, the royalists received reinforcements from Cadiz, spreading the armed confrontations throughout the country, while the patriots' successes continued until the end of 1813.
On December 3, 1813 Simón Bolívar learned that the Royalist forces (3,500 men), under the command of Brigadier José Ceballos, had met with those of José Yáñez in the town of Araure (Edo. Portuguesa), and as a result, he arranged for all the bodies that were in El Altar and Cojedes to attend the concentration that would take place in the town of Agua Blanca.
On the 4th, the Republicans marched towards Araure and camped about 1,000 m from the village, opposite the Royalists, who had deployed at the entrance of the Acarigua River mountain; with their wings supported by a forest and covered by a small lagoon; their back was garrisoned by a forest; they also had ten artillery pieces.
On the 5th, the discovered republican woman pawned the action and was immediately flanked and cut off by a column of cavalry. The small attacking force was virtually destroyed. Meanwhile, Simon Bolivar deployed his divisions in battle, to resume the attack. Colonel Manuel Villapol stood on the right; Colonel Florencio Palacios in the center and Lieutenant Colonel Vicente Campo Elías, with the Barlovento Battalion, on the left.
The cavalry covered both sides of the device. A cavalry corps was assigned as a reserve. Before the Republican attack, Ceballos marched his cavalry against the right of the attackers, to distract and disorder them, but Bolivar, attentive to this movement, pawned his reserve, which disordered and put the opposite cavalry in flight.
This intervention of Bolivar allowed the breaking of the enemy front, action that produced great confusion within the defensive position, with the consequent triumph of the Republicans.
A division was in charge of covering the battlefield, which was covered with corpses and supplies of all kinds, while the pursuit of the defeated was carried out by Bolivar himself. The republican forces marched that day to Aparición de la Corteza, where Bolivar set up his provisional headquarters.
The battle began at dawn and lasted approximately six hours. The royalist troops were numerically superior to the patriotic troops. The patriots were left with 200 prisoners, four flags and numerous artillery pieces. In this single clash, passionate and violent, more than 500 horsemen of Yáñez, the Ñaña of the Llaneros, perished with their lance. The battalion that fought here on the last day of Barquisimeto was punished by the Liberator, denying him the name and the right to carry a flag. On April 10, 1851, by decree of the Congress of the Republic under the mandate of General José Gregorio Monagas, the territory that currently makes up the state of Portuguesa became a province, with Guanare as its capital.


=== Federal War ===
The federal war was even more devastating than the emancipatory war in the states of Portuguesa, Apure and Barinas. Especially in Portuguesa it was where it meant the most, since in addition to the outrages and loss of life in the fighting, the departures of uncontrolled guerrillas, the passions and quarrels produced more deaths and misfortunes than the combats; furthermore, the arson attacks on houses, farms and cattle yards that plunged many families of the time into ruin.
In the days of this uncontrolled movement and in the vicinity of Araure, specifically in Tapa de Piedra, on April 4, 1859, a bloody combat was staged between the revolutionary forces of General Zamora and those of the conservative Manuel Herrera. After almost three hours of confrontation, Herrera lost the fight and had to flee with the survivors on the way to Ospino. Following the Federal Revolution in 1866, it was decided to unite the Zamora and Portuguesa entities into one and call it Zamora State. Later, with Antonio Guzmán Blanco in power, the territorial division was reduced to seven states, so Portuguesa became part of the South West state, along with Cojedes and Zamora.


=== 20th century ===
At the end of the 19th century, the Restoration Revolution brought back the country's political division into 20 states and, consequently, Portuguesa and Cojedes became Zamora again. Finally, on August 5, 1909, the National Constitution was promulgated, which established that Venezuela would be composed of a Federal District, two Federal Territories and 20 states, one of which would be Portuguesa with the capital in the city of Guanare.
Like most of the Llanos states, Portuguesa was practically isolated from the center of the country until the middle of the 20th century. The only way to move from this entity to another was by means of carts pulled by horses or oxen, or by using the waterways. After the overthrow of General Isaías Medina Angarita, the Revolutionary Government Board began to materialize the existing projects designed by the previous rulers on sustainable agricultural development based on the colonization of large areas. It was in the 1940s, when work began on the Los Llanos road, which meant the economic take-off of the region. The foundation of the Turén Agricultural Colony through the work of 20,000 immigrant refugees, mostly Italian, drove the rice plan, and the incorporation of hundreds of hectares of irrigated land were key to the development and growth of this state known as the granary of Venezuela.

Within this reality, a developmentalist model was adopted with evident influence from the United States. This model made possible the establishment of social relations of production in the agricultural sector based on capitalism. In this vein, at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, a "State Project" was initiated called the Turen Agricultural Unit (U.A.T.), which was successively implemented in the Turen Agricultural Colony. To this end, the government, through itinerant diplomacy, made use of the international agreements signed during the post-war period on aid to refugees and put into practice the open border policy of selective immigration promoted by General Marcos Pérez Jiménez, where Europeans (mostly Italians, Spaniards and Germans) with an agricultural tradition entered and shared work with Venezuelan citizens from various regions of the Republic. In 1949, the Agricultural Unit or Colony of Turen, the most ambitious experience of its kind ever carried out in a Caribbean country, was initiated. Located, as well as the Tovar colony, in an area of mountains, the future Granary of Venezuela sheltered, together with a minority of local farmers, a babel of immigrants from several countries. Initially, they were mainly Eastern Europeans, who arrived through the "International Refugee Organization", many of them ethnic Germans from Romania, but already in the beginning of the 50's the Italians and Germans became the relative majority of the immigrant population.
