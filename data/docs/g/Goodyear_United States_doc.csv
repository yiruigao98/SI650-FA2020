It is a suburb of Phoenix and at the 2010 census had a population of 65,275,  the third fastest-growing city in Arizona between 1990 and 2000. The 2019 population estimate was 86,840.The city is home to the Goodyear Ballpark, where the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball hold spring training.

== History ==
Goodyear was established in 1917 with the purchase of 16,000 acres (65 km2) of land by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to cultivate cotton for vehicle tire cords. World War II was important to Goodyear in the 1940s as the current Phoenix Goodyear Airport was built, but after the war, the economy suffered. Goodyear became a town on November 19, 1946.  At the time, it had 151 homes and 250 apartments, a grocery store, a barber shop, beauty shop and a gas station.


=== World War II ===
Luke Field Auxiliary #6 (Goodyear Field) was built by the United States Army Air Forces in 1943. It served as a satellite airfield for Luke Army Air Field (AAF) . According to the History of Luke AFB, this airfield boasted the most facilities. It had separate buildings for crew chiefs, operations, supply, barracks, pit latrine, crash truck shed, generator shed and a control tower. Luke AF Auxiliary #6 ceased operations by 1971.The property, which is in a state of complete abandonment, is owned by the State of Arizona, which has worked with developers on proposals for use.


=== Modern history ===
In January 1965, the Phoenix Trotting Park, a harness racing track opened, the current Interstate 10 passes north of the site. As the region lacked major roads from Phoenix to Goodyear, there was not enough business and the track closed two years later. The Park no longer stands, as it was demolished in 2017. The park had  been abandoned since the late 1960s.
The town became a city in 1985. In the same decade, the remaining 10,000 acres (40 km2) of the original farmland was sold for future development. The Phoenix Goodyear Airport received its current name in 1986.


==== Housing and growth ====

Although Goodyear was founded in 1917, the majority of construction and population growth happened after 1990. 22 communities that are completed and under construction have a total area of approximately 20,000 acres (31 sq mi). These communities, along with another 21 communities for future suburban development, will contain almost 200,000 homes, with only 25,000 built.Goodyear was affected by the 2000s American housing bubble, reducing home values. Since then, the housing market has rebounded considerably. According to Opendoor, zip code 85338 in Goodyear was the fifth most popular place in the Phoenix metro area to buy a home, based on home sales. There are also a variety of home options in 2019 to accommodate families, those who are single, and seniors. As the population in Goodyear grows faster than ever, home builders and community developers are working quickly to keep up with the demand.
Estrella is the largest community in Goodyear, at 20,000 acres (31 sq mi). The community is home to about 10,000 residents. Palm Valley, located north of Interstate 10, is 9,000 acres (14 sq mi), with variously-sized homes. PebbleCreek is a community for active adult living, with 54 holes of championship golf, fitness centers, and restaurants.
From the 1990s through the 2010s, residential development has stimulated the growth of Goodyear as a suburb of Phoenix. Goodyear's population is projected to be 358,000 by 2035.

This includes a 10,000-seat park, Goodyear Ballpark, that opened in 2009. The Reds and the Indians have separate offices, clubhouses and practice fields.
