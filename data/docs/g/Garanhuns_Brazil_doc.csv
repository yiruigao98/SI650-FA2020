Garanhuns is a city in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. Located in the Borborema Plateau, the town is known as the "Suíça Pernambucana" (Pernambucan Switzerland) due to its elevation and relatively cool climate. It is also known as "Cidade das Flores" ("City of Flowers") or "Cidade da Garoa" ("City of Drizzle").
Garanhuns is most famous for the Festival de Inverno, or The Winter Festival, which it holds every year in July. During the winter, temperatures in Garanhuns can drop to 7 degrees Celsius (45 degrees Fahrenheit). This is quite cold for a city that is only a few degrees south of the equator.
Garañun (Garanhun) was an extinct, undocumented language once spoken by an indigenous tribe in the Serra dos Garanhuns.
