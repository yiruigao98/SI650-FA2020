== History ==
Until the 1960s the area was primarily agricultural, and most businesses in town were concentrated along the coastal road "Strandvejen".  With numerous holiday cottages near the coast of Køge Bugt (Køge Bay), this was also the destination for many inhabitants of Copenhagen on holiday away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
During the late 1960s and into the 1970s, many people moved permanently out of Copenhagen and into new homes in places like Greve.  What was formerly farmers' fields quickly turned into districts of detached houses, whilst most of the shops and similar businesses near the coastal road moved into central shopping malls such as Hundige Storcenter and Greve Midtby Center. Around 1980 the S-train railroad network was expanded towards Køge, and the stations Greve and Hundige were placed adjacent to the shopping malls.
Today, it serves primarily as a residential municipality, functioning as a suburb for the larger Copenhagen area.
