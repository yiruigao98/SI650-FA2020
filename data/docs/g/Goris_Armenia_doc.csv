== Etymology ==
Throughout its history, Goris has been known as Kores and Gorayk. However, there are several explanations for the origin of the name. It is supposed that the name Goris is derived from the Indo-European prelanguage words "gor" (rock), "es" (to be), i.e. Goris/Kores meaning a rocky place. There was a dwelling in the ancient times in the same area of the town.
The name Goris had many variants including: Goristsa, Kores, Gores, Gorayk, Goru, and Geryusy.


== History ==


=== Ancient history and Middle Ages ===

The area of Goris has been settled since the Stone Age. Goris was first mentioned in the history by the Urartian period. King Rusa I of Urartu who reigned between 735 and 713 BC, left a cuneiform, where he mentioned that among the 23 countries conquered by him, Goristsa country was one of them. The scientists suppose that it is the same Goris.
During the Middle Ages, the town-settlement was situated in the eastern part of the present Goris, on the left bank of Goris river. It was called Kores and coincided with one of the villages of Goru and Gorayk mentioned by Stephen Orbelian in his 13th-century work History of Syunik Province.
Between the 12th and 15th centuries, Syunik along with the rest of the historic territories of Armenia suffered from the Seljuk, Mongol, Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu invasions, respectively.


=== Persian rule ===
At the beginning of the 16th century, Syunik became part of the Erivan Beglarbegi within the Safavid Persia. The current spelling of the name was first mentioned in 1624, in a handwriting by Barsegh Yerets. In the 17-18th centuries princes Melik Husenyans ruled the region.
At the beginning of the 18th century, the region was the centre of the Armenian liberation campaign led by David Bek, against Safavid Persia and the invading Ottoman Turks. In 1750, the region became part of the newly-formed Karabakh Khanate.
At the beginning of the 19th century, many territories of Armenia -including the region of old Kores of Syunik-, became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the Treaty of Gulistan signed on 24 October 1813, between Russia and Qajar Iran following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–13.


=== Russian rule ===

Under the Russian rule, the town of Goris was founded in 1870 to become the centre of Zangezursky Uyezd, within the Elisabethpol Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1876, the construction of new Goris was completed near the old town of Kores, with the initiative of the head of "Starastky province" and recommendation of Prince Manuchar-Bek Melik Husenyan, and the major city plan designed by a German architect. At the end of the 19th century the economical and cultural life of the town was greatly improved.


=== Brief independence (1918-21) ===

With the establishment of the Republic of Armenia in 1918, Goris was included within the Zangezur gavar (Zangezur region) of the newly-founded republic. However, after the fall of the First Republic of Armenia in 1920, the 2nd Pan-Zangezurian congress held in Tatev on 26 April 1921, announced the independence of the self-governing regions of Daralakyaz (Vayots Dzor), Zangezur, and parts of Mountainous Artsakh, under the name of the Republic of Mountainous Armenia (Lernahaystani Hanrapetutyun), with Goris as a de facto capital city. However, the self-proclaimed republic had a short life, when the Red Army conducted massive military operations in the region during June–July 1921, attacking Syunik from the north and east. As a result of fierce battles, the Republic of Mountainous Armenia capitulated on 13 July 1921, following Soviet Russia's promises to keep the mountainous region of Zangezur as part of Soviet Armenia.


=== Soviet rule ===
Under the Soviet rule, Goris served as the regional centre of Zangezur gavar of Soviet Armenia. With the establishment of the Goris raion in 1930, the town became the regional centre of the newly-founded district.
