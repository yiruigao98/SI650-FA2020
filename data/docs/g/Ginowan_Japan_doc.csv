Ginowan was heavily damaged during World War II. After the war, half of the area of the city was allocated for use by the United States military. A refugee camp was built in the Nodake area of Ginowan. The population of the refugee camp increased exponentially, and the area was renamed Nodake City. The American occupation forces abolished Nodake City in 1946, and renamed the area Ginowan Village. Subsequently, the occupation authorities confiscated the main areas of Ginowan to build military bases. The area became a base town with military bases centered in Nodaka and Futenma.Around 33% of Ginowan has been leased by the Japanese Ministry of Defense for use as U.S. military base under the Japanese and American mutual defense agreement. and hosts part of the Marine Corps' Camp Foster.
Ginowan was elevated to city status on July 1, 1962.
