Located in Göd, the Samsung SDI Hungary plant is one of Samsung SDI's triangle of advanced Lithium-ion automotive battery production facilities: another is in Ulsan, Korea, and the other is in Xian, China. The plant at Göd is not far from the Austria-based battery pack division of Magna Steyr which was acquired by Samsung SDI in 2015 for $120 million. In 2016-2017, the Samsung SDI Ulsan plant trained several employees for the Samsung SDI Hungary plant. The Ulsan plant had supplied the BMW i3, but the Samsung SDI Hungary plant will provide the BMW i3, i5, and X5 with advance Li-ion batteries.


== Infrastructure ==
Göd is connected to Budapest (via Dunakeszi, southbound) and to Vác (via Sződliget, northbound) by railway and public roads. On an average weekday, there are buses and trains every 30 minutes to both directions. Vác is 15 minutes by car and by train, and 25 minutes by bus. Western Railway Station (Budapest) is 30 minutes by train. Because of these benefits, Göd is sometimes categorized as a dormitory town, as many commuters seem to come home from the city only to sleep. Nevertheless, Göd has a vivid social life: civil organizations, churches, galleries, clubs, monthly newspaper, etc. that makes the town different from an average dormitory town.
