== Origin of the name ==
Goiatuba became a city in 1931, and the origin of the name is curious:  "Goia" comes from the Goia Indians and "Tuba" is a Tupi-Guarani word meaning  "big". So, Goiatuba is the same as "big Goiás".


=== History ===
The settlement of the region took place in 1860 when ranchers from Minas Gerais settled to raise cattle and grow crops.  In 1892 land was donated to establish a town.  The first name was "Bananeiras" because of the abundance of this fruit in the region.  With the building of the first chapel the town was called São Sebastião das Bananeiras.  In 1900 it was elevated to a district and became a municipality in 1931.
