== History ==
According to the history published by the city, Gretna's history can be traced to a  plantation established by Jean de Pradel by 1750 (when the plantation house, Monplaisir, was built).  By 1813, the plantation had passed into the hands of one Francois Bernoudy. John McDonogh, also spelled John McDonough, then a resident of New Orleans, bought the establishment, moved into the house and founded a settlement in 1815, that would be named McDonoughville. He subdivided the rest of the former plantation into regular city lots and 30-arpent farming strips. McDonoughville thus became the first subdivision in Jefferson Parish. McDonough either leased or sold these properties to white laborers or free people of color.Gretna was settled in 1836, originally as Mechanikham, growing with a station on the Mississippi River for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, Texas and Pacific Railway, and Southern Pacific Railroad, with a ferry across the River to New Orleans.  The famous spice-maker Zatarain's was founded here in 1889.  Gretna was incorporated in 1913, absorbing the section of McDonogh within the Jefferson Parish boundaries. In the 1940 census, Gretna had a population of 10,879.
