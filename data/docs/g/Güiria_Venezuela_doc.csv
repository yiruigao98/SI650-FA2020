Güiria is the capital city of Valdez Municipality in the Venezuelan state of Sucre. Güiria was the place where the military campaign for South American independence set out to Upper Peru and also a starting point of the 1901 Venezuelan Civil War (Revolución Libertadora). Founded on 8 December 1767, Güiria is the state's third-largest urban centre, with a population of approximately 40,000. It is an important harbour, the only one in Venezuela located on the open Atlantic Ocean rather than on the Caribbean Sea, and the economic centre of Paria Peninsula, due to it being near the Gulf of Paria's natural gas fields, where several state and private companies have exploration projects.


== Economy ==
The natural gas industry has been developed in Güiria by means of the Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho Industrial Complex (CIGMA), developed by Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). The project's main goal is to promote the economic and industrial growth of Sucre state and to supply natural gas also to the states of Nueva Esparta, Monagas and Anzoátegui. It is planned to be connected in later stages to the nationwide gas distribution system to supply the rest of the country and for export.
Additionally, Güiria produces coconuts, cocoa, tobacco, tubers and fish. Cattle is also raised.
