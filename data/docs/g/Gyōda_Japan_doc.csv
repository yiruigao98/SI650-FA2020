=== Important historical sites ===

Saitama Kofun Park (さきたま古墳公園) is a 300,000 square metres (3,229,173 sq ft) historic park dotted with large ancient tombs, including the Maruhakayama Kofun, one of the largest round burial mounds in Japan. At Shogunyama Kofun, a key-hole shaped 91 metres (299 ft) long burial mound that is square at the head and rounded at the foot, there is a display room of its interior where the stone cave hut and excavated articles have been restored to their original conditions in the 5th to 7th centuries.
Ancient Lotus Park (古代蓮の里, Kodai hasu no sato) has lotuses that were grow from seeds estimated to date back 1,400 to 3,000 years which had been found by chance during excavation for the building of a waste disposal facility. After a few thousand years of dormancy, they awoke and germinated. The large pink blossoms bloom only in the morning for about a month from mid-July after the close of the rainy season.
Oshi Castle (忍城御三階櫓, Oshi-jo Gosankai Yagura) is a 1988 reconstruction of the third yagura tower of Oshi Castle. The daimyō Narita Akiyasu built Oshi Castle near the end of the 15th century using the natural levee of the surrounding marshlands and river. It was considered impregnable. When it was attacked by the 20,000 man army of Ishida Mitsunari in 1590, it did not fall even when it was flooded by water drawn in from the nearby river, leading to the rumor that it floated on water. The existing turret was reconstructed in 1988. The castle grounds are also the home of Oshi Tōshō-gū shrine.


=== Culture ===
Zeri Furai is a local speciality consisting of fried bean curd, carrots, onion, and potato. There are many shops which sell it around town, especially during the warmer seasons.
Gyōda is also quite well known for the making of traditional tabi socks, worn with kimono. Gyoda still makes half of the tabi made in Japan.
