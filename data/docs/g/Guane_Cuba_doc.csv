== History ==
Guane is a Cuban Indigenous name. Before it was renamed Pinar del Río in 1774, the area was known as the old colonial capital of Guane.
It was the main city of Filipino migrants to Cuba, who were known as Chinos Manila among the local population. The Filipinos worked the huge tobacco plantations much as they did in their home country, in the present provinces of Ilocos Sur, Tarlac, Ilocos Norte, Cagayan and Isabela.  During that time, the Spanish colonizers had a virtual monopoly of the tobacco trade through their company, the Tabacalera.
