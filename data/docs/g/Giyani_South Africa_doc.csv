The CBD of Giyani is nicknamed "Benstore", as popularly referred to by the residents of the city. The District Municipality Council of Mopani seat is Giyani. Giyani is a city which is surrounded by a number of villages, which are administered by the Greater Giyani Municipality, which explains the rich Tsonga cultural activities surrounding the area. Prof. HWE Ntsanwisi, the former Chief minister of Gazankulu played a vital role in establishing the city. Giyani is situated at the intersection between R578 road (South Africa) and R81. It is located in the heart of Limpopo Bushveld, on the northern bank of the Klein (Little) Letaba River west of Kruger National Park. Situated in the northern portion of former Gazankulu, Giyani was established in the 1960s as the administrative centre for the Tsonga people. Giyani is now the administrative capital of Mopani District Municipality. Giyani lies 470 km north east of Johannesburg by road, 104 km from Tzaneen,  105 km from the Phalaborwa Gate of the Kruger National Park and 35 km from Malamulele.
The 'Giyani Ward' at Elim Hospital was named after Giyani, the ward was opened in 1969 and since the first Gazankulu Legislative Assembly was convened at the same time (1969) when the new ward at Elim Hospital was being opened, the Gazankulu Government therefore named the ward at Elim Hospital 'Giyani Ward' in honour of the Gazankulu Capital city. Six years later in 1975, the Gazankulu Government named another newly built Ward at Elim Hospital 'Valdezia Ward' in honour of the first Swiss Mission Station in Valdezia, 10 km east of Waterval township. The Swiss Missionaries did mission work amongst the Tsonga people in the Hlanganani district of the former Gazankulu homeland. Later, the Swiss missionaries expanded its mission work to a large Tsonga settlement at Masana in Bushbuckridge and at Shiluvana settlement near Tzaneen.


== History ==
Giyani was established during the 1960s as a capital City of Gazankulu, before the 1960s, the land where Giyani is situated belonged to Homu Royal Family.The name Giyani has been named by Hosi SDW Nxumalo. The Risinga Community came led by their headman Chabalala. The Risinga Community (under their headman Chabalala) originally came from the Elim district, next to the township of Waterval, above Elim Hospital, where they lived under the authority and were subjects of Paramount chief / Hosi Njhakanjhaka of Elim. Before moving to Giyani during the 1880s, the Risinga Community were subject of Chief/ Hosi Njhakanjhaka and occupied the land where the village of Shirley is situated today and were falling under Elim / Shirley Tribal Authority under Hosi Njhakanjhaka. While still at Elim, Chabalala was an Induna to Hosi Njhakanjhaka. The Risinga community moved to Giyani, along with the other Chabalala headman, Hosi Siyandhani Chabalala and the Mapayeni Community (under Headman Mapayeni Chavalala who settled at the bottom of Rhida hills) during the 1880s, in search of pastures for their livestock and settled on the foothills of Man'ombe Mountain,which belongs to Manombe royal family, similar to the lands they left behind at Elim/Shirley.Chief Man'ombe welcomed Risinga family and the Chavalala family. He placed Risinga at the place now known as Benstore and Chavalala at the place now known as homu 14B. The man'ombe family owned the whole land until the apartheid laws favoured the majority of people and gave the land to the Chavalala family, and recognised them as chief. At Elim District, the Risinga community left behind the other Chabalala headman, Nwa-Mhandzi Chabalala, who remained at Levubu river valley until the 1960s, when he was forcefully removed in terms of Group Areas Act and dumped at Bungeni village and became a headman of Hosi Bungeni.Headman Nwa-Mhandzi Chabalala is the only Chabalala headman left today at Elim district and has a big village called eka-Nwamhandzi under Hosi Bungeni.
The entire land on the foothills of Manombe Mountain belonged to Manombe family who occupied the Ndauland called 'Madzime-N'ombe'and still is although it was wrongfully given to the Risinga Community until they were uprooted by the Apartheid Government to make way for the establishment of the town of Giyani. The Old Parliament Buildings at Giyani and the old Ministerial Houses as well as the Palace of the Chief Minister of Gazankulu were built on what used to be the Chief's Kraal and headquarters of the Risinga Community.Across the main road, the Risinga Community used to drive their herds of cattle for grazing at a place known today as Giyani Golf course. Giyani Section E, Section A, Section D1 and D2 and CBD of Giyani, known as Bendstore were villages of the Risinga Community. The Risinga Community was forcefully removed from their land during the 1960s in order to make way for a new Capital of Gazankulu and were relocated Homu Block 14 and Makoxa Village with their chief, Hosi Homu Chabalala. Upon their arrival at the foothills of Monombe mountain, they became independent and had their own chief, Hosi Homu Chabalala, he ruled the Homu Tribe which included the Risinga Community until they were expelled from Giyani during the consolidation of Gazankulu homeland. The name Risinga was replaced by 'Giyani' and the Risinga Community lost their land. The only thing that remain of the Risinga Community was a High School at Giyani section D2, named Risinga High School, the school was named after the Risinga chieftainship that was destroyed during the 1960s by the apartheid Government.The Mabunda Tribe, under chief/ Hosi Ngove, was situated not far from the Risinga Community, but was not their chief and chief Ngove or the Mabunda Tribe did not have Authority over the Risinga Community, the Risinga Community had their own independent chief, Chief Risinga. After the expulsion and removal of the Risinga Community in the 1960s, the Mabunda Tribe was allocated land that traditionally belong to the Risinga Community. All the lands where the town of Giyani is situated and surrounding lands belonged to the Risinga Community but the apartheid Government wrongly allocated that land to the Mabunda tribe and banished the Risinga Community into the wilderness at Homu Block 14.

Historically, Giyani had no entry-point to the Kruger National Park even though Giyani shares a long border with Kruger National Park. The plan to open a new gate at Giyani has been approved. The gate which is known as Shangoni Gate will be opened at Muyexe Village, 30 km North-East of Giyani town. This gate will bring much-needed development in the nearby villages of Muyexe, Mahonisi and Mtititi where unemployment is 80%.These villages have been historically poor, despite the fact that they are bordering one of the world best safari destinations. There are plans to develop state of the art conference facilities, sporting facilities and agricultural projects around the villages of Muyexe. Some of the project are sponsored by the Department of Rural Development. The upgrading of road from gravel to tar road is also underway between the villages of Muyexe and the town of Giyani. The road from Shangoni gate to Shingwezi Rest Camp will be constructed at a later stage. The new gate will cut the distance from Giyani to Shingwezi by almost 80 km. The visitors who want to visit Shingwezi Rest Camp from Gauteng by car can also shorten their itinerary by using this new route.
