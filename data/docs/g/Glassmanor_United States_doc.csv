The following is a list of United States cities, towns and unincorporated areas (Census Designated Places) in which a majority (over 50%) of the population is African American or Black, according to data from the 2000 Census. This list does not include cities such as Chicago, Illinois or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in which, according to the 2000 Census, merely a plurality (as opposed to a majority) of the residents are African American. The list below is organized by state and, within each state, by population size. The percentage of each city's population that is African American is listed in parentheses next to the city's name.
