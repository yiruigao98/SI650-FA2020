== History ==
Quart de Poblet was probably founded by the Romans. The historian Euriclidión describes in his work how neighbors of Quartum  helped Hannibal's army at be paralyzed by the River. Its name derives from the Latin word quartum miliarium,  which refers to the distance that separates it from Valencia. As vestiges of that era survive remains of the Roman bridge and the aqueduct Els Arquetes. 
However, it was in the Middle Ages when its people became protagonists of important events in the history of Valencia: Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, El Cid, led in Quart de Poblet a significant battle against the Almoravids forces named like the town and is reflected in the Cantar de Mio Cid, and in sources highlights the reference to the Quart de Poblet Castle, now gone.
After the Reconquista, King James I of Aragon gave the Castle, the town of Quart and the farmstead of Aldaia to the Priory of the Hospital of Aldaia of Sant Vicent de la Roqueta  (in the Book of distribution distribution folio 78-v °, seat # 1472 – consists that on January 7, 1244, Jaime I said, I quote: "A Sant Vicent, el Castell i la Vila de Quart, i l'alcria de Ladea -Aldaia-").  At that time, the population had only 130 houses with old Christians.
It was in 1287 when Quart, by decision of King Alfonso II of Aragon was under the jurisdiction of the Monastery of Santa Maria de Poblet, belonging to the Cistercian order dependent and the San Vicente de la Roqueta. In fact, a monk of St. Vincent continued to be the foreman of the place, but sometimes delegated the functions to the mayor. In 1332, King Alfonso IV gave permission to the abbot of Poblet, Ponce de Copons, to expel the Moorish and in 1334 granted the charter of settlement to 52 families of Catalonia and Aragon, who made Quart de Poblet their new home. This charter consecrate the birth of the modern city. The dependence of Poblet was maintained until the confiscation decreed by Juan Alvarez Mendizabal in 1835. It was a legacy the second part of the name of the municipality.
