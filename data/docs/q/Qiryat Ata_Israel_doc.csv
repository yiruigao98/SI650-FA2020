== History ==
The Early Bronze Age site at Qiryat Ata has been extensively excavated since 1990, revealing stratified remains from the Neolithic, EB (=early Bronze Age), IB and EB II periods. At Tell el ‘Idham remains from a continuous habitation from the early Bronze Age, through the Persian age down to the Roman era have been identified.Archaeologists Mordechai Aviam and Dan Barag (1935–2009) thought it to be the Capharatha (Greek: Καφαραθ᾽) mentioned by Josephus in the Lower Galilee, one of several views tentatively identified for the site.Rock-hewn winepresses dating to the  Byzantine era have been found here. Some have had crosses and Greek letters incised, supporting the theory that there was a Byzantine monastery located in the area. Ceramics from the Byzantine era have also been found here, and a building from the Byzantine or early Islamic period has been excavated.In 1283 it was mentioned as part of the domain of the Crusaders, according to  the hudna between the Crusaders  and the Mamluk sultan Qalawun. At the time it was called Kafrata. Ceramics from the Mamluk era have also been found here. An excavation at Independence Street, Qiryat Ata, showed nearly continuous settlement dating from the Persian and Hellenistic eras up to the Mamluk era (late eleventh–early fifteenth century CE).


=== Ottoman era ===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Kufrata appeared in the census of 1596, located in the Nahiya of Acca, part of Safad Sanjak. The population was 15  households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, cotton, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 1,508 akçe.The village appeared under the name of Koufour Tai on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled during Napoleon's invasion of 1799, while in 1856 it was named Kefr Ette on the map of Southern Palestine that Heinrich Kiepert published that year.In 1859 the population was estimated to be 100, and the cultivation was 16 feddans. In 1875 Victor Guérin visited, and found the village to have 50 houses.In 1881 the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described Kefr Etta as "a small adobe village, on the plain, with a well on the north and olives on the east."A population list from about 1887 showed that Kh. Kefr Etta had about 285 inhabitants; all Muslims.


=== British Mandate era ===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Kufritta showed a population of 400; 7 Christians and 393 Muslims, where all the Christians were of the Orthodox faith.In 1925 a Zionist organisation purchased  10,000 dunums from Alexander Sursock, of the Sursock family of Beirut.  At the time, there were 75 families living there.In the 1931 census  Kufritta had a population of 4  Muslims and 29 Jews,  in a total of 13 occupied houses.In 1934, one of the country's largest textile plants, ATA, was established there.In the 1945 statistics the population of Kfar Atta (Kufritta) consisted of 1,690 Jews and the land area was 6,131 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 6 dunams were designated for  citrus and bananas, 39 dunams for plantations and irrigable land, 1,527 for cereals, while 3,591 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.


=== Kiryat Ata ===

In the early 20th century, the lands of the Arab village of Kefr Etta were purchased by a Warsaw religious foundation named "Avodat Israel" through intermediaries in the American Zion Commonwealth. Avodat Israel founded Ata in 1925.  During the 1929 Arab riots the town was attacked and abandoned. A year later the residents returned and rebuilt the community. The town was renamed Kfar Ata in 1940, which was also the name of the local textile factory. In 1965, when the village was merged with adjacent Kiryat Binyamin, the name became Kiryat Ata.
