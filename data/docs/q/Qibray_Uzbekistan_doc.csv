The President of the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston Respublikasining Prezidenti, Ўзбекистон Республикасининг Президенти) is the head of state and executive authority in Uzbekistan. The office of President was established in 1991, replacing the position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR, which had existed since 1925. The president is directly elected for a term of five years, by citizens of Uzbekistan who have reached 18 years of age.Islam Karimov was the only President of Uzbekistan for 25 years following the establishment of the office; he won three consecutive elections which many consider to have been rigged. The third election was the most controversial since he had been elected twice and the current Constitution stipulated a maximum of two terms. The official explanation was that his first term in office, of five years, was under the previous Constitution and did not count towards the new limit. He died in office on 2 September 2016. A joint session of both houses of the Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan appointed Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev as interim President on 8 September 2016. In December 2016, Mirziyoyev was elected President in a popular vote, though international observers described the election as not free and fair, due to restrictions on media reporting and ballot stuffing.
