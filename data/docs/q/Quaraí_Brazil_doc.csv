The Quaraí or Cuareim River (Portuguese Rio Quaraí, Spanish Río Cuareim) is a tributary of the Uruguay River.


== Location ==
The river originates in the Coxilha de Santana (Spanish Cuchilla de Santa Ana), an area of low-lying hills, and runs westward to join the Uruguay River. It forms the boundary between Uruguay on the south and Rio Grande do Sul state of Brazil on the north.


== Border dispute ==
There is a long-standing and unresolved border dispute between Uruguay and Brazil along part of Quaraí River. However, this is not seen as a politically disturbing issue between the two countries, which have close and friendly diplomatic relations and strong economic ties. So far, the disputed areas have been effectively under Brazilian control.
