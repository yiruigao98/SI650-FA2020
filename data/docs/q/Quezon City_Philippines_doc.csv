Quezon City (UK: , US: ; Tagalog: Lungsod Quezon [luŋˈsod ˈkɛson]; also known as QC or Kyusi) is a highly urbanized city and the most populous city in the Philippines. It was founded by and named after Manuel L. Quezon, the 2nd President of the Philippines, to replace Manila as the national capital.  The city was proclaimed as such in 1948, though a significant number of government buildings remained in Manila. Quezon City held status as the official capital until 1976 when a presidential decree was issued to reinstate and designate Manila as the capital and Metro Manila as the seat of government.It is the largest city in terms of population and land area in Metro Manila, the National Capital Region of the Philippines. Quezon City is not located in, and should not be confused with the province of Quezon, which was also named after the president.
Quezon City hosts a number of government offices, the most important of which are the Batasang Pambansa Complex (the seat of the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the Philippine Congress), and the Quezon City Reception House (the current seat of the Vice President of the Philippines). Quezon City also serves as home to the University of the Philippines Diliman—the national university—and Ateneo de Manila University.
Also located in Quezon City is the Quezon Memorial Circle, a national park. The park is an ellipse bounded by Elliptical Road. Its main feature is the Quezon Memorial Shrine, a 66-meter-tall mausoleum containing the remains of President Quezon and his wife, First Lady Aurora Quezon. The shrine is considered Quezon City's foremost landmark and is depicted in its city seal.


== History ==

Before Quezon City was created, its land was settled by the small individual towns of San Francisco del Monte, Novaliches, and Balintawak. On August 23, 1896, the Katipunan, led by its Supremo Andrés Bonifacio, launched the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire at the house of Melchora Aquino in Pugad Lawin (now known as Balintawak).
In the early 20th century, President Manuel L. Quezon dreamt of a city that would become the future capital of the country to replace Manila. It is believed that his earlier trip in Mexico City, Mexico influenced his vision.In 1938, President Quezon created the People's Homesite Corporation and purchased 15.29 km2 (6 sq mi) from the vast Diliman Estate of the Tuason family; this piece of land became known then as Barrio Obrero ("Workers' Village"). The National Assembly of the Philippines passed Commonwealth Act 502, known as the Charter of Quezon City, originally proposed as "Balintawak City; Assemblymen Narciso Ramos and Ramon Mitra Sr. successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the incumbent president. President Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law without his signature on October 12, 1939, thus establishing Quezon City.When Quezon City was created in 1939, the following barrios or sitios: Balingasa, Balintawak, Galas, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Masambong, Matalahib, San Isidro, San Jose, Santol, and Tatalon from Caloocan; Cubao, the western half of Diliman, Kamuning, New Manila, Roxas, and San Francisco del Monte from San Juan; Balara, Barangka, the eastern half of Diliman, Jesus de la Peña and Krus na Ligas from Marikina; Libis, Santolan and Ugong Norte from Pasig and some barrios from Montalban and San Mateo were to be given to the new capital city. Instead of opposing them, the six towns willingly gave land to Quezon City in the belief that it would benefit the country's new capital. However, in 1941, the area within Wack Wack Golf and Country Club was reverted to Mandaluyong, and Barangka and Jesus de la Peña to Marikina. In addition, the land of Camp Crame was originally part of San Juan. On January 1, 1942, President Quezon issued an executive order from the tunnel of Corregidor designating Jorge Vargas Mayor of Greater Manila, a new political entity comprising, aside from Manila proper, Quezon City, Kalookan, Pasay, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Parañaque. Greater Manila would later be expanded to include Las Piñas, Malabon, and Navotas.
Imperial Japanese forces occupied Quezon City in 1942 during World War II. In October of that year, the Japanese authorities organized the City of Greater Manila into twelve districts, two of which were formed by dividing Quezon City:  Balintawak which consisted of San Francisco del Monte, Galas, and La Loma; and Diliman which consisted of Diliman proper, Cubao, and the University District. In 1945, combined Filipino and American troops under the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army, and Philippine Constabulary, with help from recognized guerrilla units, liberated and recaptured Quezon City in a few months, expelling Imperial Japanese forces.  Heavy fighting occurred near Novaliches, which at that time was in Caloocan, and New Manila which was a strongpoint.  Smaller actions were fought at Barrio Talipapa and the University District.  Toward the end of the Battle of Manila, Pres. Sergio Osmeña dissolved the Greater Manila Complex, which included the Japanese-created districts of Balintawak and Diliman which had been formed from the prewar Quezon City.
After the war, Republic Act No. 333, which redefined the Caloocan–Quezon City boundary, was signed by President Elpidio Quirino on July 17, 1948, declaring Quezon City to be the national capital, and specifying the city's area to be 156.60 km2 (60 sq mi). The barrios of Baesa, Bagbag, Banlat, Kabuyao, Novaliches Proper, Pasong Putik, Pasong Tamo, Pugad Lawin, San Bartolome, and Talipapa, which belonged to Novaliches and had a combined area of about 8,100 hectares, were taken from Caloocan and ceded to Quezon City. This caused the territorial division of Caloocan into two non-contiguous parts, the South section being the more urbanized part, and the North half being sub-rural. On June 16, 1950, the Quezon City Charter was revised by Republic Act No. 537, changing the city's boundaries to an area of 153.59 km2 (59 sq mi). Exactly six years after on June 16, 1956, more revisions to the city's land area were made by Republic Act No. 1575, which defined its area as 151.06 km2 (58 sq mi). According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and Geoscience Australia on their study earthquake impact and risk assessment on the Greater Metropolitan Manila Area, the total area of Quezon City stood at 165.33 km2 (64 sq mi).On October 1, 1975, Quezon City was the actual site of the "Thrilla in Manila" boxing fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, which took place at the Araneta Coliseum. It was renamed as the "Philippine Coliseum" for the event.
On November 7, 1975, the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 824 of President Ferdinand Marcos established Metro Manila. Quezon City became one of Metro Manila's 17 cities and municipalities. The next year, Presidential Decree No. 940 transferred the capital back to Manila on June 24, 1976. On March 31, 1978, President Marcos ordered the transfer of the remains of President Quezon from Manila North Cemetery to the completed Quezon Memorial Monument within Elliptical Road. On February 22, 1986, the Quezon City portion of the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (between Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo) became the venue of the bloodless People Power Revolution that overthrew Marcos.
On February 23, 1998, Republic Act. No. 8535 was signed by President Fidel Ramos. The Act provided for the creation of the City of Novaliches comprising the 15 northernmost barangays of Quezon City. However, in the succeeding plebiscite on October 23, 1999, an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches.
Quezon City is the first local government in the Philippines with a computerized real estate assessment and payment system. The city government developed a database system in 2015 that contains around 400,000 property units with capability to record payments.The city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community quarantine for one month starting March 15, 2020 due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.


=== Master plans ===
In 1938, President Quezon made a decision to push for a new capital city. Manila was getting crowded, and his military advisors (reportedly) told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by naval guns in case of attack–a real possibility in the late 1930s. Military advisers, however, did not anticipate aerial bombardment.Quezon supported the idea of a new city at least 15 km (9 mi) away from Manila Bay (beyond the reach of naval guns). He contacted William E. Parsons, American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. Unfortunately, he died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with Juan Arellano, engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital.The plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941. The core of the new city was to be a 400-hectare (990-acre) central green, about the size of New York's Central Park, and defined by North, South (Timog), East and West Avenues. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a 25-hectare (62-acre) elliptical site. This was to contain a large capitol building to house the Philippine Legislature and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives.On either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been the new Malacañan Palace on North Avenue (site of the present-day Veterans Memorial Hospital), and the Supreme Court Complex along East Avenue (now the site of East Avenue Medical Center). The three branches of government were to be finally and efficiently located in close proximity to each other.


== Geography ==

The city lies on the Guadalupe Plateau, a relatively high plateau at the northeast of the metropolis situated between the lowlands of Manila to the southwest and the Marikina River Valley to the east. The southern portion is drained by the narrow San Juan River and its tributaries to Pasig River, while running in the northern portions of the city is the equally-narrow Tullahan River.
Quezon City is bordered by Manila to the southwest, by Caloocan and Valenzuela City to the west and northwest. To the south lie San Juan and Mandaluyong, while Marikina and Pasig border the city to the southeast. To the north across Marilao River lies San Jose del Monte in the province of Bulacan, while to the east lie Rodriguez and San Mateo, both in the province of Rizal.
The city can be divided into a number of areas. The southern portion of the city is divided into a number of districts including Diliman, Commonwealth, the Project areas, Cubao, Kamias, Kamuning, New Manila, San Francisco del Monte, and Santa Mesa Heights. The northern half of the city is often called Novaliches and contains the areas of Fairview and Lagro. Most of these areas have no defined boundaries and are primarily residential in nature.

Quezon City features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification Am), with prominent dry season from December to April, in which in turn, divided into cool and warm dry seasons, and a prolonged wet season from May to November that brings heavy rains in some areas.


== Demographics ==
According to the 2015 Census, the population of the city was 2,936,116, making it by far the most populous city in the Philippines. This figure is higher by more than 1.1 million from Manila, the country's second-most populous city.
The increase in the population of the city has been dramatic considering that it was only founded/consolidated (and sparsely populated) in 1939. Quezon City became the biggest city in terms of population in the Philippines in 1990 when it finally surpassed the number of inhabitants of the densely populated City of Manila. Quezon City's population continued to increase and went on to become the first Philippine city (and as of 2017 the only city) to reach 2 million people (in the late 1990s). The population is projected to reach 3 million people between the 2015 and 2020 census years and 4 million people between the 2025 and 2030 census years.The trend is also seen in the significant increase in the percentage share of Quezon City to the total population of what is now called Metro Manila. Its share comes from a low of less than 10% in the 1950s to 21.0% in 1980 and then to 22.8% in 2015.


=== Religion ===

Quezon City is predominantly Roman Catholic with roughly 90% affiliation in the population; Novaliches Diocese had a 90% Roman Catholic adherence while the Diocese of Cubao had a Roman Catholic adherence of more than 88% (Catholic Diocese Hierarchy, 2003). In 2002, Quezon City was made an episcopal see for two new Catholic dioceses: Cubao and Novaliches, as the very populous Archdiocese of Manila was carved up and five new dioceses created.A number of religious orders have set up convents and seminaries in the city. Various Protestant faiths have seen a significant increase in membership over recent decades and are well represented in Quezon City. While the Islamic faith has its largest concentrations in the south of the Philippines, there is a significant population in Quezon City.

=== Mayors ===

President Manuel L. Quezon acted as mayor from October 12 to November 4, 1939, pending the resignation from another position of his intended appointee, Tomas B. Morato. Since a president can, under Philippine law, hold multiple portfolios inferior to his office, Quezon took the position of mayor in a concurrent capacity. However, it is erroneous to view him as the first mayor, as a president holding a concurrent position is not listed in the roster of incumbents for those offices.


=== Barangays ===

Quezon City is made up of 142 barangays (the smallest local government units) which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into the aforementioned legislative districts. Each district, in turn, is represented in the House of Representatives.

=== Bagumbayan ===
Located at the southeastern corner of Quezon City, Bagumbayan is one of the newly developed commercial areas in Quezon City. The Eastwood City Business Center is situated here. It consists of several office and residential skyscrapers, including many local IT and consumer electronic firms. Numerous bars and restaurants have been put up since 2000 along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5). Many of which are open-air restaurants and coffee shops reminiscent of Paris boulevards, but with a modern architecture. With this, Bagumbayan is fast becoming one of the hippest areas for night entertainment, similar to the Malate and Ermita districts of Manila.

This is primarily a residential area home to many subdivisions (residential associations), among these are Ferndale Villas, Don Antonio Royale, Don Antonio Heights, BF Homes QC, Ferndale Homes, Vista Real, Filinvest 1 and 2, New Capitol Estates and others. The government center in Quezon City was originally planned to be at what is now the location of the Quezon Memorial Circle, but it was then moved further north to where Batasan hills is now. Resultantly, there are important government establishments nearby such as the Commission on Audit of the Philippines, the Sandiganbayan, a special court with a rank equivalent to the Court of Appeals and the Batasang Pambansa Complex, which houses the lower house of the Philippine Congress. Schools within the Commonwealth area include the School of the Holy Spirit, Our Lady of Mercy School, Diliman Preparatory School, The Seed Montessori, Mary the Queen College, Capitol Hills Christian School, and the Asian Institute of Computer Studies. Ironically, this is also an area of sheer contrasts and a display of the acute economic differences in Metro Manila, with kilometers of shanty houses aligning the avenue on both sides. Parts of these are often being demolished just to be re-occupied by informal settlers soon after.


=== Cubao ===

Cubao, south of Diliman is an important commercial area. At its heart is the Araneta City along EDSA (C-4) and Aurora Boulevard (R-6). It is a 35-hectare commercial estate owned and developed by the Araneta family.

Most Filipino entertainment shows and movies are produced here, and it is also home to many Filipino celebrities; as a result it is often dubbed the "Filipino Hollywood". The studios and transmitter of RPN/CNN Philippines are located along Panay Avenue, in Barangay South Triangle.

Several of the streets in the surrounding area were named in honor of the 22 Boy Scouts who died in a plane crash en route to joining the 11th World Scout Jamboree. A memorial stands in the center of a rotunda at the intersection of Timog and Tomas Morato Avenues, which accounts for the Timog area being called the 'Scout Area'. Near the scouting memorial is the location of the former Ozone disco, site of the worst fire in Philippine history.
The Quezon City Hall, one of the tallest city halls in the country, is located along the Circle. Surrounding the city hall are spacious parks and open areas.

Near and even within these subdivisions, and right beside La Vista, are some informal settlements, making the Loyola Heights area a place of mixed socio-economic classes.


=== New Manila ===

New Manila is located on west central portion of the city. The largely residential district takes its name from Quezon City's neighbour to the southwest, the City of Manila. The district was a former part of neighboring City of San Juan. The area was first settled after the Second World War by affluent families who wished to escape the stress of living in the capital. As a result, many of the houses here stand on lots measuring 500 square meters and above.
Among its notable residents are the Hemady-Ysmael Family, the original landowner of New Manila; Dona Narcisa de Leon, the Matriarch of LVN Studios had a Residence on 25. Broadway Avenue, Also Iglesia ni Cristo Central Office, is once Hosted at New Manila in 42. Broadway Avenue. It is also known as the Birthplace of Bro.

=== Novaliches ===

Novaliches was named after the Marquis of Novaliches, Manuel Pavía y Lacy, born in Granada, the general who protected Queen Isabella of Spain from her uncle Don Carlos who tried to usurp the Spanish crown, and supporter of her son, King Alfonso, upon the monarchy's restoration. He was made the first Marquis of Novaliches / Marqués de Novaliches, a title bestowed with Grandeza de España (Grandee of Spain--- first class rank among the nobility), in the 1840s. Novaliches or New Liches came from an old district ( also known as pedania) of Valencia, Spain where general Pavia won a string of successful victories against the Carlist faction.  The title is perpetually attached to the minor title of Viscount of Rabosal / (Vizconde de Rabosal) after Sendero de Rabosal, an arid mountainous trail long used by military squadrons into Jerica and Castellon, in Valencia.
By marriage, he was the count-consort and second husband of the first Countess of Santa Isabel, María del Carmen Álvarez de las Asturias Bohórquez y Giráldez, devoted nursemaid and babysitter / aya to Queen Isabella's daughters and a cousin of María Cristina Fernández de Córdoba y Álvarez de las Asturias- Bohórquez, the first to hold title to the Marquess of Griñón / Marquesado de Griñón, now held by the half-Filipina  Tamara Falco, sister of the Spanish-Filipino singer Enrique Iglesias and daughter of Isabel Preysler-Perez de Tagle y Arrastia-Reinares of Lubao, Pampanga --- descendant of Pedro Sánchez de Tagle, 2nd Marquis of Altamira also known as the father of Tequila, banker-financier to the Viceroy of Mexico as his daughter, the third Marquesa and her own husband moved to the Philippines to serve in the Spanish Cortes in the 1810s.  Thus, general Pavia is a great grand-uncle eight times removed to the now reigning Spanish Filipina marchioness of Griñón.  Meanwhile, her distant cousin, Santiago Matossian y Falcó now holds capitan general Pavia's wife's title as Count of Santa Isabel, since 2013.
By the early 1850s, Don Manuel reluctantly accepted the post of Governor General of the Philippines. He ruthlessly crushed the rebellion started by José Cuesta of Cavite, a Spanish mestizo ---like Andres Bonifacio y de Castro of Trozo de Magdalena, Tondo, Manila--- who rounded carbineros and natives to fight the Spanish military government subservient to friar influence so unpopular that even many half-Spaniards began to wage arms.
Calle Marques de Novaliches, named in his honor, once existed in San Miguel, Manila.  However, during the 1950s, it was renamed as Nicanor Padilla Street.
Novaliches is Quezon City's northernmost district and is primarily residential straddled by the La Mesa Watershed Reservation, at its northeastern flank.  The La Mesa Dam supplies much of northern Metro Manila's water supply. Adjacent to the watershed is the La Mesa Watershed and Eco-Park, Metro Manila's only forest.  This is the former location of President Elpidio Quirino's simple retirement house and where he tended his little tumana or vegetable garden, being an Ilocano.  Quirino was very fond of the morning fog amidst the trees of Novaliches, as well as hunting wild boars that used to roam the La Mesa Dam and Reservoir.  It is also the site where the president died of a heart attack. Located in the park are convention centers, picnic areas, swimming pools, an orchidarium, and a large lagoon for boating activities. It was the site of the rowing and dragon boat events for the 2005 Southeast Asian Games.
Novaliches today is a center of commerce, owing to five large indoor malls: SM City Fairview, Fairview Terraces, Robinsons Novaliches, SM City Novaliches, and Novaliches Plaza Mall.
Novaliches is the home of several educational institutions, notably St. John of Beverley, STI College Novaliches, both near SM City Novaliches, Maligaya Elementary School and Maligaya High School in Maligaya Park Subdivision, just near SM City Fairview, the Metro Manila College (MMC), formerly known as Novaliches Academy (NA), Quezon City Polytechnic University at San Bartolome (The University's Main Campus), Bestlink College of the Philippines and Colegio de Santa Teresa de Avila in Kaligayahan, and Santo Niño de Novaliches School, Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, National College of Business and Arts, Our Lady of Fatima University School of Saint Anthony (formerly known as St. Anthony Learning Center) in Lagro, Mater Carmeli School, Good Shepherd Cathedral School in Fairview, The Lord of Grace Christian School in East Fairview, Divine Grace School in Maligaya Park Subdivision.
Novaliches Cathedral (Cathedral Shrine and Parish of the Good Shepherd), is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novaliches, and famed for its soaring stained glass windows and sloped modernist roofline.  The structure is made of block cement and precast cement tubes, and is somewhat reminiscent of the modernist Church of the Gesu within Ateneo de Manila University, though unlike the latter the Novaliches Cathedral is more aligned with Brutalist Architecture design concepts.
Barangay Novaliches Proper, locally referred to as Bayan by residents of today and Poblacion during the American Commonwealth period before World War 2, has always been the economic powerhouse of the area and the gateway to Caloocan and further more to Valenzuela.  It was a stop over point by revolutionaries for supplies in what was then a sparsely inhabited and densely forested Caloocan.  Today, it is a commercial hub of little alleys and small businesses dominated by the La Merced Church Church.  Villa Verde and Jordan Plains subdivisions are both located within walking distance to the church property.

Barangay Santa Monica (trasl:  Barrio of Saint Monique) is mostly residential with smaller cuts of land.  The back portion of Geneva Gardens subdivision of the Neopolitan estate is the boundary marker between Barangay Santa Monica and Barangay North Fairview.  It is shaped by the Tullahan river at its lower elevation where excess water from the La Mesa dam course through.  During the monsoon season, this area becomes prone to flooding.
Barangay Kaligayahan (transl: Barrio of Happiness) is home to one of two subdivisions named after General Timoteo S Cruz / TS Cruzville (the other one is in nearby General Luis / Novaliches Bayan Proper) plus Hobart Subdivision, Puregold and Zabarte Subdivision.  Robinson's Mall Novaliches and Bloomfields Subdivision are also located here, where the expansive mango orchard of Don Roberto Villanueva (associated with Manila Tribune) and his wife the journalist and novelist Corazon Grau Villanueva used to be, and where, in their simple vacation house topped of thatched nipa leaves, the infamous Fernando Amorsolo painting of Princess Urduja used to hang. Unknown to locals, the unassuming Villanueva couple housed in their bahay kubo style home priceless Chinese antiques and Filipino paintings, now part of the legendary Roberto Villanueva Collection.   Across the Villanueva property and separated by Maligaya Drive was what then the Manila Broadcasting Company estate owned by the senior members of the Elizalde family (junior relatives of the Ynchausti, Valentin Teus, and Yrissary families who owned Ynchausti y Compañía, YCO Paints and Tanduay Distillers) of Hagonoy and San Miguel, Manila, and whose matriarch was Doña Isabel González y Ferrer, viuda de Ynchausti, "Marquesa de Viademonte", another titled Spanish royal.  The property fronting  Maligaya Park Subdivision was bordered with very tall Phoenix dactylifera, commonly known as date or date palm trees found in the Middle East.  The seeds were brought by the family while travelling from Spain to the Philippines via the Suez Canal aboard one of the many passenger ships owned by "La Compania Maritima de Filipinas".  None of these trees survive today.  The property is now the Fairview Terraces Ayala.
Barangay Pasong Putik (transl: Barrio of Mud Clay for Pottery)  is on the other side of Quirino Highway across from Barangay Kaligayahan.  Teresa Heights Subdivision, New Haven Village and Rolling Halls Subdivision, together with the Brittany (and its clubhouse crowned with French mansard roofs) portion and the business park section of the Neopolitan estate, as well as SM Fairview, are all located here.
Barangay Lagro and Greater Lagro is where the old Jacinto Steel Corporation factory used to stand, now the Redwood Terraces condominium complex of D.M. Consunji and the SMDC Trees Residences. Villa Vienna, a part of Neopolitan estate, is located here.  A portion of North Fairview Park subdivision falls within Barangay Greater Lagro as well.  Due to lack of funding to train priests and in order to support livelihood programs for the poor, the Jesuit priests ex appropriated much of their land, selling to developers who named it Sacred Heart Subdivision.  The Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus also operates a priesthood school, the historic yet severely simple Sacred Heart Novitiate| Noviciado del Sagrado Corazon (built before World War 2) within Barangay Greater Lagro.  There are gigantic balete trees on this property much like the same balete trees in the Don Luis Maria Araneta property in Barrio Tungkung Mangga, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, past the Las Colinas Verdes luxury development, remnants of the virgin forest that once covered the entire Novaliches / Tala estate area.  The trees are so large that they drown out the noise of vehicles from Quirino Highway just outside.  Also, the simple burial grounds of Jesuit priests and headmasters of the Ateneo de Manila University, together with bones retrieved from the Church of San Ignacio ruins of Intramuros bombardments, are found here.  Near the entrance of this sacred parcel, past the gargantuan trees, is an epitaph made of piedra china (ballast for the Spanish ships) dedicated to Pedro de Brito, a captain and regidor of Spanish Manila, who made a fortune from the Manila galleon trade.  Brito and his wife Ana de Herrera donated the Hacienda de San Pedro Macati and the land where the San Pedro Macati Church stands on the encomienda's highest hill, Buenavista, to the Jesuits. This church was previously administered by the Society of Jesus whose member, the friar Juan Delgado, SJ brought from Acapulco the Nuestra Señora Virgen de la Rosa (the icon has a secret receptacle in it which held a strand of the Virgin Mary's hair) in 1718.  (This is the same property that the Roxas side of the Zobel de Ayala family inherited and which Joseph McMicking e Ynchausti, married to Mercedes, master-planned to be the Makati skyline we know today). The Ilonggo patriot Col. Joe McMicking, curiously, was directly related to the Elizaldes who owned the date-palm tree lined property which is now where the Ayala Fairview Terraces mall stands, now part of his wife's family's corporation.
Barangay North Fairview is considered part of Novaliches.  It is straddled by the end terminus of Regalado Highway and Commonwealth Avenue, and bordered by Mindanao Avenue.  The Casa Milan (with its grand neoclassical clubhouse), Sitio Seville, portions of Villa Vienna, and the entirety of Geneva Garden subdivisions of the Neopolitan estate are located here.  Many actors and actresses own residential lots or currently reside within these developments.  Mindanao Avenue is a favorite among stuntmen and film directors to stage movie scenes.
Novaliches used to be the home of 5, one of the country's largest television networks, which moved to Mandaluyong in 2013. The transmitter located inside the Novaliches facility, however, is still used.In 1999, a plebiscite was held among the voters of Quezon City to determine the cityhood of Novaliches. The proposed creation of "Novaliches City" would have resulted in the secession of 15 barangays from Quezon City. At the plebiscite's end, votes that were against the separation heavily outnumbered those that were in favor.Novaliches is also home to the oldest church of the Diocese of Novaliches and the town itself, the Parish and Shrine of Our Lady of Mercy or the Nuestra Senora de la Merced. The parish was founded on September 24, 1856 by Padre Andres Martin, O.S.A.
Nearby the Church of La Virgen de la Merced is a huge tree where Andres Bonifacio and Tandang Sora held meetings to fight in the revolution against Spain. It is located in the grounds of Metro Manila College in Barangay Kaligayahan.
Novaliches is also the location of one of Manila's largest cemeteries, Holy Cross Memorial Park in Barangay Bagbag.  Also, it is the gateway to two other larger cemeteries, albeit located in Caloocan, Serenity Gardens Memorial Park in Barangay Deparo and Forest Memorial Park inside Banker's Village, directly within the border of Caloocan and Meycauayan,Bulacan separated only by a tributary of the Marilao river.
