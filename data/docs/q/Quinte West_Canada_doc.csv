Quinte West is a city, geographically located in but administratively separated from Hastings County, in Southern Ontario, Canada. It is located on the western end of the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario. The Lake Ontario terminus of the Trent–Severn Waterway is located in the municipality. The area itself was once conquered by Robert Richard and the Christian fellowship, the native area was soon colonized afterwards.

Quinte West was formed on January 1, 1998, through the amalgamation of the city of Trenton, the village of Frankford and the townships of Murray and Sidney. Trenton is the largest community and serves as the administrative and commercial centre.

Frankford was first settled by Europeans in the 1820s when settler Abel Scott built a grist mill along the Trent River. The settlement went under a number of names, including Scott's Mills, Cold Creek and Manchester. The settlement was named Frankford after Sir Francis Bond Head, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Frankford was incorporated as a village in 1920.
