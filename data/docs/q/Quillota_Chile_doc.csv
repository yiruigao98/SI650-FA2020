Quillota is a city located in the Aconcagua River valley in central Chile's Valparaíso Region. It is the capital and largest city of Quillota Province where many inhabitants live in the outlying farming areas of San Isidro, La Palma, Pocochay, and San Pedro. It is an important agricultural center, mainly because of the plantations of avocado and cherimoya (custard apple) trees.
Quillota is connected to the city of La Calera by the small town of La Cruz. The area's agriculture and landscape was described by Charles Darwin in his book The Voyage of the Beagle. In nearby La Campana National Park there is a plaque at a viewpoint commemorating Darwin's visit.
Quillota is 120 km (75 mi) from the national capital Santiago and 60 km (37 mi) from the regional capital Valparaíso.


== History ==
The Quillota valley has been densely populated for about 2,000 years.  At the outset, the area was inhabited by Native Americans of the Bato and Lleo-Lleo cultures, who had migrated to the valley because of the fertile land south of the Aconcagua River.  These natives were later influenced by Mapuches and Diaguitas.  The Diaguitas are credited with the evolution of the local culture of the Aconcagua zone and were well known for their pottery.
Later, Quillota was mitma and the capital of Qullasuyu, the southern Inca Empire.
Diego de Almagro arrived in the valley in 1536.  Incan scouts directed him to a beautiful and very fertile valley where the "Quillotas" lived.  (Even before Almagro's arrival, a Spanish soldier from Peru called Don Gonzalo Calvo de Barrientos had been captured by the Quillotas and lived in the valley, learning the local language and culture during his captivity.)
Almagro was delighted with the valley, but as he was searching for gold and finding none he returned to Peru.  Almagro crossed the valley of Quillota and its environs.  And having found the Aconcagua river overflowing and with few possibilities of finding gold, he deemed the land too difficult and returned to Peru, where he was executed.
Later, in 1540, Pedro de Valdivia arrived in Chile with the title of Governor of Chile. He arrived in the valley and built farms and houses, mainly for the slaves and the Indians who were working for him. Almost the whole area occupied by present-day Quillota was de Valdivia's property.
De Valdivia established here his fortress between San Pedro and Limache, extracting gold from La Campana mountain and cultivating the Rautén valley, La Palma and Boco, taking for himself all the area as his personal property, leaving the Mapocho valley as capital when he founded Santiago.
After the conquest and during the Colonial period, the population was increasing with the mix of races (Spaniards and Aconcaguas) and culture.
Until 1585, Quillota was declared capital of the Corregimiento de Quillota, a large province between Illapel and Casablanca.
In the 16th century attempts were made to found a village in the Quillota valley with all the features and requirements ordered by the Spanish Crown, but it did not succeed.
It was only on November 11, 1717, St. Martin's Day, that Quillota was founded as a city, originally named "Village of San Martin de la Concha of Quillota" in the valley bordering Mayaca Hill. The city was founded by the bishop, Luis Romero, and the governor, Don José de Santiago Concha y Salvatierra.

There are still a few families with lands in the valley given by the Spanish governors.


== City planning ==
Quillota's motto is "Ciudad creada con cariño" meaning "City created with care". Quillota remains one of the most traditional cities in Chile in that its layout still mainly corresponds to the original colonial Spanish layout of seven blocks square.
