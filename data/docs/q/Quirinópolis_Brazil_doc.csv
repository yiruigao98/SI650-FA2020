== History ==
The written European history of Quirinópolis begins in 1832 with the arrival of João Cristóstomo de Oliveira, who was from Minas Gerais.  He took over a vast area of land and tried to keep anyone else from settling down.  Nevertheless, some years later in 1860 a village was established with the name Abadia do Parnaíba.  In 1879 the name was changed to Nossa Senora da Abadia, later Rio Verde, and finally Quirinópolis honoring the builder of the first chapel, José Quirino Cardoso.  In 1943 it became a municipality.
