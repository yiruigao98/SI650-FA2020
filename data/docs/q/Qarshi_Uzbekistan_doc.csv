According to the Dictionary of American Family Names, the Qureshis are descendants of the Quraysh, the leading tribe in Mecca at the time of the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (ad 570); Muhammad's father was a member of it. The Quraish at first opposed Muhammad's teachings and are said to have persecuted him and his followers, but by the time of his death they had begun to convert to the new faith and played an important role in bringing Arabia under the banner of Islam.
