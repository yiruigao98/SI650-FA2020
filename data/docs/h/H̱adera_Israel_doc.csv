== History ==


=== Ottoman era ===

Hadera was founded on 24 January 1891, in the early days of modern Zionism by Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Latvia on land purchased by Yehoshua Hankin, known as the Redeemer of the Valley. The land was purchased from a Christian effendi, Selim Khuri. This was the largest purchase of land in Eretz Israel by a Zionist group, although the land was of low quality and mostly swampland. The only inhabitants prior to the purchase were a few families raising water buffaloes and selling reeds. The village was named after Wadi al-Khudeira (Arabic: وادي الخضيرة‎‎‎, lit. 'the valley of verdure'), as the nearby section of Hadera Stream was known. Earlier, the whole Hadera Stream had been known as Nahr Akhdar (Arabic: نهر الأخضر‎, lit. 'green river').The Crusaders called the location Lictera – a corruption of the Arabic name, el-Khudeira. From the outset, attempts were made to pick instead a Hebrew name for the new settlement. About half a year after it was founded, rabbi Ya'akov Goldman reported on an event in "the moshav of Hadere, that is, Hatzor". The name Liktera was in preferential use by the British military during World War I.Baron Rothschild's surveyor, Yitzhak Goldhar, claimed that Hadera was founded on the site of the former town called Gedera of Caesarea (Hebrew: גדרה של קיסרין‎), as mentioned in Tosefta Shevi'it, ch. 7. Benjamin Mazar preferred to locate ancient Gador, formerly known as Gedera by Caesaria, at Tell Ahḍar ("green hill"), later known as Tell esh Sheikh Ziraq and currently as Tel Gador, on the coast south of Giv'at Olga. Others say that the ancient Gadera should be identified with Umm Qais or with al-Judeira.
The first Jewish settlers lived in a building known as the Khan near Hadera's main synagogue. The population consisted of ten families and four guards. Baron Edmond de Rothschild provided funding for Egyptian laborers to drain the swamps. Old tombstones in the local cemetery reveal that out of a population of 540, 210 died of malaria. Therefore a Bible verse from the Psalms (Tehillim) was inscribed in the city's logo: "Those who sow in tears, will reap with songs of joy." (Ps 126:5) Hashomer guards kept watch over the fields to prevent incursions by the neighboring Bedouin.
By the early twentieth century, Hadera had become the regional economic center. In 1913, the settlement included forty households, as well as fields and vineyards, stretching over 30,000 dunams.


=== British Mandate ===
Land disputes in the area were resolved by the 1930s, and the population had grown to 2,002 in 1931. Free schooling was introduced in the city in 1937 in all schools apart from the Histadrut school.

		


=== State of Israel ===
After the 1948 War, the north-western part of  Hadera (including "Newe Chayyim") expanded on the land which had  belonged to the depopulated Palestinian village  of Arab al-Fuqara.Hadera's population increased dramatically in 1948 as immigrants flocked to the country. Most of the newcomers were from Europe, though 40 Yemenite families settled there, too. In 1953, Israel's first paper mill opened in Hadera. Financed by investors from Israel, United States, Brazil and Australia, the mill was designed to meet all of Israel's paper needs.New neighborhoods were built, among them Givat Olga on the coast, and Beit Eliezer in the east of the city. In 1964, Hadera was declared a city.In the 1990s, large numbers of Russian and Ethiopian immigrants settled in Hadera. Hadera, considered a safe place by its inhabitants, was jolted by several acts of terrorism during the second intifada. On October 28, 2001, four civilians were killed when a terrorist opened fire on pedestrians at a bus stop. A massacre of six civilians at a Bat Mitzvah occurred in early 2002. A suicide bomber blew himself up at a falafel stand on October 26, 2005, killing seven civilians and injuring 55, five in severe condition. However, since the construction of the West Bank barrier, the frequency of such incidents has dropped drastically. During the second Lebanon War, on August 4, 2006, three rockets fired by Hezbollah hit Hadera. Hadera is 50 miles (80 km) south of the Lebanese border and marked the farthest point inside Israel hit by Hezbollah.In the 2000s, the city center was rejuvenated, a high-tech business park was constructed, and the world's largest desalination plant was built. New neighborhoods are under construction in the underdeveloped northeastern part of the city, and plans are under way for a large park, shopping malls and hotels with a total of 1,800 rooms. The city is envisaged as a future vacation destination due to its closeness to the Galilee, beaches, and access to major highways.
