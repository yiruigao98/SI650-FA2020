Notes


== History ==

Today's Hanford was once north of Tulare Lake, historically the largest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi River. The area was inhabited by the Tachi Yokut Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as sloughs), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces. Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.

Since the annexation of California after the Mexican-American War, the locality was settled by Americans and immigrants as farmland, broadly referred to as "Mussel Slough". The earliest dated grave in the area was that of a young Alice Spangler who was initially buried in the Kings River Cemetery just north of her family's farm in 1860. As the settlement grew, Tulare Lake's feeding rivers were diverted for agricultural irrigation, causing it to gradually shrink and, over the 19th and 20th centuries, effectively become extinct.
From the mid-to-late 1870s, the Southern Pacific Railroad planned to lay tracks towards the developing farmland west of Visalia, spurring a growth in labor and population. Hanford's namesake was James Madison Hanford, an executive for the company. The earliest known document labeling the settlement as "Hanford" is an 1876 map of Tulare County which once included the territory of present-day Kings County. Tracks were laid through a sheep camp in 1877. According to History of Kings County: "It was but a short step from sheep-camp to village and with the railroad as an attraction the village flourished and became a town within a few historic months." Many of those working on the tracks were Chinese immigrants.
In 1877, Hanford began to appear in state newspapers, giving details of events in the town's early days. In December 1877, there was a stagecoach robbery. In 1878, Hanford began running their own newspaper service and wiring called "The Public Good" which fed into other papers. In May 1878, Hanford residents drafted a resolve against the South Pacific Railroad from purchasing land with residing settlers. In June 1878, the Workingmen's Party was reported to have a majority vote over the Democrats in the town. In October, the town proposed state legislature to limit claims to land because of the railway. In November, a William Blunt was arrested for stealing several horses from the town. Later that month, masked men burned down the house of farmer Perry Commodore Phillips, retrospectively claimed because he purchased land from the railroad. On December 16, by concert of action, Phillips and J.B. Fretwell had their newly-purchased land plowed. On March 27, 1879, a fire broke out in the back of E. Schoenfeld's store which spread due to harsh winds, affecting next-door druggist J.T. Baker and burning down a saloon and a barbershop. On April 27, Hon. Creed Hammond spoke in Hanford. In May, the Upper Kings River Canal and Irrigation Company filed articles of incorporation. On August 1, California Governor candidates George Clement Perkins and Romualdo Pacheco (and on August 10, O F Thornton and W F White W P C) spoke in Hanford and Lemoore. Perkins would become California's 14th Governor on January 8, 1880.In May 1880, a dispute over land titles between settlers and the Southern Pacific Railroad resulted in a bloody gun battle on a farm 5.6 mi (9.0 km) northwest of Hanford that left seven men dead. This event became famous as the Mussel Slough Tragedy. The next month, the town's first census was held counting some 269 residents. Forty-four of them were Chinese immigrants who resided in what's known today as China Alley.A post office was established in 1887.On several occasions, major fires destroyed much of the young community's business district. The need for fire protection led to the town becoming an incorporated city in 1891. Its first mayor was local resident Yamon LeBaron.
An electrical generating plant was built in 1891 by pioneering flour miller H.G. Lacey, bringing the first electric lights to the city. The Lacey Milling Company was still operating in Hanford in 2016.
The first public high school, Hanford Union High School, was started in 1892 with one teacher, W. S. Cranmer, and an average enrollment of fourteen.When Kings County was created in 1893 from the western part of Tulare County, Hanford became its county seat.
A second railroad was laid through Hanford in 1897, which today is the main north–south line of the BNSF Railway through the San Joaquin Valley. The original east–west Southern Pacific Railroad branch line is now operated by the San Joaquin Valley Railroad.

In 1901, a restaurant called the Star opened on Sixth Street across from the Southern Pacific tracks. The Star Restaurant was still doing business at the same location in 2019.
In 1903, steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie donated $12,500 for the construction of the Hanford Carnegie Library which opened in 1906 (and is now the Hanford Carnegie Museum).Saloons flourished in Hanford's early days despite an anti-saloon movement until the town voted to become "dry" in 1912, eight years before nationwide Prohibition was enacted.In the 1930s, famed pilot Amelia Earhart lived in Hanford to teach flying lessons at Fresno Chandler Airport. She befriended local resident and student of hers Mary Packwood with whom she gifted a personally-designed dress and left luggage shortly before her disappearance in the Pacific Ocean in 1937. The belongings are on display in Hanford's Carnegie Museum.Around May 1944 during World War II and shortly before running of The White Cliffs of Dover, a short color documentary called Hanford at War was made showing downtown, interiors of the Fox Theatre, and several different schools and social gatherings.
In 1962, a notable murder of 15-year-old Marlene Miller took place; it was featured in an episode of Forensic Files.From the mid 1990s to early 2000s, the Stonecrest Subdivision was constructed on the north side of the city for modern suburban housing and cul-de-sac roads.

== Economy ==
Hanford is a major trading center serving the surrounding agricultural area. According to the California Employment Development Department, as of September 2012, most residents of the Hanford-Corcoran Metropolitan Statistical Area were employed in services (31,000 employees), government (14,400 employees) and farming (6,400 employees) as well as in some manufacturing enterprises (5,700 employees).The heavy industry sector has declined significantly over the past 30 years. An oil refinery formerly operated in the city under several different owners (Caminol Oil Co. from 1932–1967, Beacon Oil Co. from 1967–1982 and Ultramar Oil Co. from 1982–1987) until it permanently closed in 1987. A tire manufacturing plant was built in 1962 by the Armstrong Rubber Co., which operated it until that company was purchased by the Italian manufacturer Pirelli, which eventually closed the factory in 2001.  In August 2017, Faraday Future announced that it had signed a lease for the former Pirelli plant where it plans to manufacture electric vehicles. The company said that it could employ up to 1,300 people over time and build up to 10,000 cars a year.Major employers within the city of Hanford in 2006 included the Kings County government with 1,041 employees, the Adventist Health System with 857, the Hanford Elementary School District with 520, the Del Monte Foods tomato cannery with 435 year-round and 1,500 seasonal employees and Marquez Brothers International, Inc., makers of Hispanic cheese and other dairy products. Many Hanford residents work for other nearby employers such as NAS Lemoore, the U.S. Navy's largest Master Jet Base located 15.5 mi (24.9 km) WSW of Hanford and for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation which operates three state prisons in Kings County.
The city was impacted by the Great Recession (2007–09) and employment was also affected by the California drought (2012–13). The unemployment rate in January 2016 was 10.3%. However, the rate had dropped to 7.9% in February 2020 at the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate had risen to 16.0% in April of that year.  According to the United States Census Bureau, median household income in Hanford was $54,767 and 18.3% of the population was living below the poverty line in 2008–2012.The homeownership rate was 57% in 2008–2012 according to the Census Bureau.Hanford had a large cluster of COVID-19 cases when about 150 coworkers were tested positive in a local poultry packing plant in May 2020. This places them as of California's highest numbers per community in a rural county like Kings. At the time, California itself had over 60,000 cases with an estimated 300 in Hanford alone.

However, the proposed station on the eastern outskirts of Hanford is listed as "optional" and will not be built without matching local funds or in-kind support. Greg Gatzka, Kings County's Community Development Director, was quoted in a June 2011 newspaper story that "the real question is whether high-speed rail is going to authorize a station there. They have a priority list and this station is at the bottom of the list."

However, according to the Consumer Confidence Report issued by the city of Hanford in March 2010 for calendar year 2009, since November 2009, the city has supplied water that is below the federal standard of 10 micrograms of arsenic per liter of water. The city's mitigation project consisted of reducing the arsenic content in two existing deep water wells, drilling five replacement wells, and eliminating eight wells that produced water that exceeded standards.
Although it does not pose a health hazard, Hanford's drinking water also naturally contains hydrogen sulfide, which caused the water to have a noticeable "rotten egg" odor. In 2014, the city began chlorinating its water for the first time, which eliminates the hydrogen sulfide odor.  In February 2015, the city completed a project to chlorinate all of its water.

== Historic Residents ==
The residents of the Hanford area up to 1877 were mainly farmers. Following information provided by the 1876 map of Tulare County, several of these farming families can be determined. Within the boundaries of today's city c. 2020 (not including its surroundings), the early landowners are named as follows:

After the 1876 map, other information on settlers over the years can be suggested from book recollections and grave entries/headstones from the Kings River and Hanford cemeteries. While many of these people were not permanent residents or might've lived on surrounding farms, their burial in the cemeteries or family notations can constitute them as such. The earliest dated grave in the area was a young Alice Spangler who was initially buried in the Kings River Cemetery just north of her family's farm in 1860, daughter of Daniel Spangler whose farm starts just north of today's city. Her sister Maggie J Spangler died on June 7, 1863. That year, J.A. Rigby died. In 1864, a baby of William Ingram died. On March 27, Daniel S Rhoads died, son of noted settler Daniel Rhoads.

The 1877 photograph pictures J.T. Baker with his store as well as an "E. Schoenfeld Peoples Store" (which was in operation by a man of that name) and a Phillips & Wilson's.

In 1880, the Mussel Slough Tragedy gives names to local settlers involved. Wayman Leftrick Pryor, being one of the "Mussel Slough Five" and in the census, was also probably the only confirmed landowner from the incident in today's Hanford. James Harris was the brother of the landowner John W Harris. Others involved in the conflict are not confirmed whether or not their property counts to be in Hanford. Still, besides Pursell, their names were:

The 1880 census provides the names of many residents considered in the locality of Hanford, listed under 46 dwellings (with 3 hotels) and consisting of 269 people. This does not include what remained to be called "Mussel Slough" and several seemed to have only stayed at the hotels temporarily. Of those people, 223 were white, 44 were Chinese, and 2 were mulatto. Of the 223 whites, 9 were known-to-be or were likely Jewish. Excluding several previously listed above, most of these families were:

The remaining 44 Chinese residents (majority male) have uncertain documentation due to linguistic communication issues. The census-taker recorded most of their surnames as "Ah" which is a Cantonese prefix for a nickname so the given names themselves might also be incorrect. Many likely only lived there temporarily to work on the railroad. The Sam Yup Chinese Cemetery, where some may be buried since the 1890s, is not yet transcribed online. It can be assumed most were Taoist due to the temple later constructed. Regardless, their names in the census appear as:
