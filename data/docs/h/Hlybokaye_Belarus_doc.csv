Hlybokaye or Glubokoye (Belarusian: Глыбокае, romanized: Glybokaye, Russian: Глубокое, romanized: Glubokoye, Polish: Głębokie, Lithuanian: Glubokas, Yiddish: גלובאָק‎, romanized: Glubok) is a town in Vitebsk Region, Belarus, the capital of Hlybokaye Raion (Belarusian: Глыбоцкі раён). The city is located on the international road from Polotsk to Vilnius with the historic railway line to Woropajewo (Варапаева) completed in 1932 in the interwar Poland (the town was incorporated in 1940 by the Soviet Union after the 1939 invasion of Poland). It has 18,200 inhabitants as of 2010.Within the city limits there are two smaller lakes: Kahalnaye (Кагальнае) and Grand (Вялікае) from which the Birchwood river originates (Бярозаўка, Brzozówka in Polish). The first written records about the settlement date back to 1514. During World War II in occupied Poland the town's district of Berezwecz was the location of a massacre of up to 2,000–3,000 Polish prisoners by the Soviet NKVD secret police, and during the Nazi occupation from July 1941 to July 1944 several thousand Jews were murdered.  As late as 2009 the remains of more than 20 victims probably shot by NKVD after the takeover of the area from Poland were again discovered in a basement of a local church.


== History ==
The first mention of Głębokie in historical sources comes from 1414 and this date shall be considered as time of the founding of the first settlement. In 1514 Głębokie was included in the documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as consisting of a manor house and a property owned by Zianowicz family. Jews first settled in Głębokie during the 17th century, and by the end of the 19th century represented about 70% of the town's 5,600 residents.


=== Poland's Second Republic ===
During Polish-Soviet War of independence, Głębokie was taken over by the Polish Army in December 1919, but in July 1920 found itself in the hands of the Bolsheviks as a result of the offensive by Tukhachevsky. On July 5, 1920 near Głębokie there was a battle in which some 1,500 soldiers died on both sides. In October 1920, the Poles regained the city. The incorporation of Głębokie into the Second Polish Republic was officially confirmed by the 1921 Treaty of Riga signed between Poland and the Soviet Union. It was given town status and became the administrative center of the Dziśnieński–Głębokie district and the seat of municipality. On February 19, 1921 Głębokie became part of Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–39), from April 13, 1922 part of Ziemia Wileńska region, and on 20 January 1926 part of Wilno Voivodeship (1926–39). On November 10, 1933 the settlement of Gliniszcza was included within the boundaries of the town of Głębokie.

According to the Polish census of 1921, some 2,844 Jews lived in Głębokie, accounting for 63% of its population. Just before the Soviet invasion of Poland in World War II, Głębokie had a population of 9,700. Most residents worked in either, confectionery factory, tannery, mill, county administration, private shops, and warehouses. Every Thursday market was held in the town's centre, and four times a year - country fairs. Also in the town stationed the Polish Border Protection Corps (KOP) regiment.


=== World War II and later ===
As a result of the Soviet invasion of Poland beginning September 17, 1939, the town was overrun by the Red Army and on November 2, 1939 incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR of the Soviet Union. It became part of the brand new Vileyka Voblast on December 4, 1939. Hundreds of Poles were arrested by the NKVD and imprisoned on trumped-up charges.  Following the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the NKVD murdered 1,000-2,000 prisoners, mostly Polish nationals, near Głębokie.Hlybokaye fell under German occupation on 2 July 1941. Shortly thereafter the Germans enacted a number of anti-Jewish laws, including the mandating of the seizure of personal property, and established a Judenrat.  The Jews of Hlybokaye were relocated into a ghetto on 22 October 1941. Mass killings of Jews began around this time and continued during the German occupation. The largest such event occurred on 19 June 1942, when the Germans, with the help of local collaborators, murdered 2,200 Jews.  During this time Jews from neighboring communities were resettled in the Hlybokaye ghetto, such that the population grew to around 4,000 by the summer of 1943.  The Germans began to liquidate the ghetto on 19 August 1943, at which time the inhabitants were told that they were to be sent to the Majdanek "labor camp".  In response, an uprising broke out in Hlybokaye organized by Jewish anti-Nazi insurgents, which was suppressed by German artillery and air support, including the use of incendiaries that set the town on fire and led to many casualties.At the local Catholic cemetery, there are graves of both parents of the famous Polish writer Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz, his father Stefan and mother Stanisława née Popowicz. In 1998, on the back wall of the house (now courthouse) which once belonged to Mostowicz family, a bilingual plaque was laid commemorating the writer.
In July 2009, in the Orthodox Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary the council during a work order found the remains faithful to the Poles. Screening is conducted, and the bones were buried, officially because of the odor.
