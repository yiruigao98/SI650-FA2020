Kayin State Cultural Museum is located in Hpa-An. Zwegabin Hill is an attractive place for visitors, as well as Kyauk Ka Lat Pagoda in which the sacred hair relic of Buddha is enshrined. Hpa An is famous for many limestone caves, like
(1) Bayin Nyi Naung Cave,
(2) Yathae Byan Cave, 
(3) Kawtgon Cave (or Kawgoon Cave), 
(4) Kaw-ka-thaung Cave and (5) Saddan Cave. Such caves are well worth visiting because of their incredibly beautiful landscapes and ancient Buddha images and other cultural items in them which are once less known due to regional instability.
Shwe Yin Hmyaw Pyi Taw Aye Pagoda is located at the heart of Pha An. Enjoying the beauty of Than Lwin River fom the platform of the pagoda is an opportunity which should not be missed.
