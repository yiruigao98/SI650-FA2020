Hod Hasharon was governed by a local council until it was declared a city in 1990.A 1,300 year old olive oil factory of mason-worked blocks was unearthed in Hod Hasharon.

Ramatayim was founded in 1925 by immigrants from Poland. It was founded on the principle of private initiative. Ramatayim was built on two hills connected by a valley, hence the name Ramatayim, literally 'two hills'. Ramatayim is now the center of Hod HaSharon.

Hadar was established in 1927 by Yael Leah Eichhorn, a middle-class immigrant from Eastern Europe, who was joined soon after by a group of Italian Jews. The land was purchased from the Abou Kishk Bedouin tribe.  The pioneers decided to build a rural settlement based on citrus crops (hence the village's name, "Hadar" being Hebrew for "citrus"). In its early years, the farmers of Hadar also engaged in poultry farming. According to the 1931 census Hadar had 71 inhabitants, all Jews, in 23 houses. In the early 1940s, Yemenite immigrants moved to Hadar, establishing the Shikun Hateymanim quarter, today part of the Gannei Tzvi neighborhood. In 1951, Ramatayim and Hadar merged to form Hadar Ramatayim.


=== Ramat Hadar ===
Ramat Hadar was established in December 1938 by middle-class immigrants from Nazi Germany, members of the Fifth Aliyah. Ramat Hadar was built on a hill between Kfar Hadar, Ramatayim, and the main road from Petah Tikva to Ramatayim. The economy of Ramat Hadar was based on small farms, mainly poultry farming. and citrus orchards. Ramat Hadar even had its own post office that was open between 1959 and 1989.
