Haslett is most notable for being the home of Lake Lansing. The lake is 461 acres (1.87 km2) in size and features two public parks, allowing access to beaches, fishing, and a boat launch. The Michigan State University Sailing Club and Lansing Sailing Club are located on Lake Lansing. From 1934 until 1974, an amusement park operated near the lake and featured a wooden roller coaster at the site that is now Lake Lansing Park South. In 2007, Business Week ranked Haslett 42nd on their list of "Best Places to Raise Your Kids".Haslett is named after James and Sarah Haslett, a couple who founded the Nemoka Spiritualist Camp on the shore of Pine Lake (Original name for Lake Lansing).  By the later 1800s, thousands of spiritualist descended on Haslett Park for summer meetings, readings, lectures, and seances.  Mr. Haslett had hoped to establish his camp as the National Headquarters for the spiritualist movement.  His untimely death 1891 and the decline of the spiritualist movement cause his widow to sell the land to the Haslett Park Association in 1898.  The new owners transformed the land into a summer recreational destination, and eventually, a figure-8 wooden roller coaster and other carnival rides were added, thus establishing what became known as Lake Lansing Amusement Park. With the railroad established, the Lansing Trolley line added rails so that people could travel from the state Capital, Lansing, to the new recreation center.  Holding to this tradition, Haslett is host to Lake Lansing Parks North and South as well as a portion of the Inter-Urban Pathway and numerous other small parks and recreation facilities.
The city of Haslet, Texas, is named after Haslett, Michigan (note that the Texas community is spelled with one 't'). The Texas town of Haslet received its name from a railroad worker who relocated to Texas from Michigan in the late 1800s.
