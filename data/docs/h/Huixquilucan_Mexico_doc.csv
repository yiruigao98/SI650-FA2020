=== History ===
Before the Spanish Conquest, the area was known as Cuautlalpan or Sierra de Las Cruces, and was inhabited by the Otomis. They originally lived in the highlands, gathering the abundant vegetation and hunting rabbits, hares, armadillos, deer and raccoons. Several crude templos have been found which were dedicated to the gods Makata (god of the mountains) and Makame (god of rain and fertility, represented by flowers). Adoratorios dedicated to a god called Otontecutli are found in the caves, monoliths and sacred rocks of the upper elevations. These people were conquered a number of times, including by the Olmecs, the Nahuatlacs and by the region of Tlacopan before being conquered by the Aztec Triple Alliance and then, of course, the Spaniards.Tradition states that the emperor Moctezuma Xocoyotzin liked the area so much that he had a palace constructed in what is now the neighborhood of Tecpan.After the Spanish Conquest, the history of the area at first was tied with Hernán Cortés. Cortés exerted his authority indirectly through the caciques of the area and through the Encomienda Tacuba, to which Huixquilucan belonged. Later, the area would be under the control of various Spaniards like Primer Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza and indigenous rulers like Totoquiahuatzin, the governor of Tlacopan. During this time, the area was being evangelized and the traditional tribute was being paid while the area was being redistributed with new names of Christian saints.
The municipality was established on October 21, 1846. In ancient times its territory had been inhabited by Otomi, Tepanec, Mexica and Acolhua populations.
Since 1960, the municipality of Huixquilucan has experienced explosive growth in population and infrastructure because of its proximity to Mexico City.  One of the first expansions was the construction of the "Fraccionamiento" (subdivision) of La Herradura, which has subsequently grown.
During Alfredo del Mazo's administration, the town increased its public debt.
