Hafizabad (Urdu حافظ اباد) is a city and capital of Hafizabad District located in Punjab, Pakistan. It is the 31st largest city of Pakistan.


== Ancient history ==
Hafizabad is an old city of Punjab, Pakistan. In 327 BC, during Alexander's invasion of Punjab, the territory of the Sandal Bar was reported to be a well populated area. Large cities were located in this territory, and a lot of sub states were organised here under the presidency of maharajas and rajas.In the 6th century, Hafizabad was visited by the famous Chinese traveller Xuanzang. He moved to Sangla and stayed one night in a town, then called Jaipura, which was located near the village of Koriala.


== Medieval history ==
In the beginning of the 7th century Rajput kingdoms dominated Eastern portions of Pakistan and northern India. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of some western Punjab region. Eastern Regions of Punjab from Multan to the Rawalpindi in north (Including region of present-day Hafizabad) remained under Rajput rule until 1193. The Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire later ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominately Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region.  During the Delhi Sultanate period a big city was situated at the site of the present village of Mehdiabad. But afterwards this territory became unpopulated and jungle-like because of shortage of water and Afghan incursions. This situation persisted until Mughal Emperor Akbar's period. Hafizabad was formerly a place of some importance, and is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as headquarters of a Mahal. Hafiz, the founder, was a favourite of Mughal Emperor Akbar.

After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while Muslim refugees from India settled in the Hafizabad.
