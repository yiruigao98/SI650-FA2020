== The City ==


=== Barsi gate ===
The city of Hansi has five gates of entry – Delhi Gate (East), Hisar Gate (West), Gosain Gate (North-west), Barsi Gate (South) and Umra Gate (South west). The peculiarity of this town is that its altitude increases after entry from any of the gates. Deserts guard this city towards its west (cities like Tosham, Devsar, Khanak).
Another prominent feature of this ancient city is its fort. Extended in an area of 30 acres (120,000 m2), it is square in shape and has security posts in all the four corners. The fort is said to be that of Great King Prithvi Raj Chauhan.
Later, the son of King Anangpal, Drupad established a sword manufacturing factory in this fort, hence it is also called "Asigarh". Swords from this fort were exported as far away as to Arab countries. As per Talif-e-Tajkara-e-Hansi by Qazi Sharif Husain in 1915, around 80 forts across the area were controlled from this centre "Asigarh".
During the period of Firoz Shan Tuglaq, a tunnel was constructed connecting the present Hansi to Hisar. The gate of fort has figures of gods, and pictures of gods, goddesses, birds can also be seen on the walls of the fort. The entry gate of the fort was built by George Thomas. This fort was declared a Protected Monument of National Importance in 1937 by the Archeological Survey, the present ASI, and is still in good condition, a must visit site for all archeologists.


=== Jain and Buddhist heritage ===
Right in front of the Fort, ancient statues of "Jain God" Mahavira and "Founder of Buddhism" Gautama Buddha are placed. These statues are worth $1 million as calculated by the Archeologists.


=== Sikh and Maratha rule ===
The Marathas captured Hansi area in 1778, who tried to establish a state for some time in this Area until Hansi fell to the Sikh Empire, and established a Sikh Empire rule under Jind State.


=== British colonial rule ===
Area came under British rule after 1803 till 1947. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, British empire crushed over 100 people from Rohnat, Mangali, Hazampur, Jamalpur, Bhatla and other villages under a road roller on the road as punishment for participating in the mutiny.
