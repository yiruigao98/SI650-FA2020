Hørsholm (Danish pronunciation: [ˈhɶɐ̯sˌhʌlˀm]) is an urban area on the Øresund coast approximately 25 km (15.53 mi) north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It covers most of Hørsholm Municipality and straddles the borders neighbouring Fredensborg Municipality and Rudersdal Municipality.
Hørsholm proper is developed around Hirschholm Palace, which was constructed in the 1730s, but the town has later absorbed several of the nearby communities that are of much older origins.


== History ==


=== Palace and market town ===

Hørsholm was founded in connection with the construction of Hirschholm Palace. Niels Eigtved created a plan for a residence town in 1737 and to stimulate its growth, it was given status as market town in 1739. However, it never came to serve as a market town and was still only a small settlement when the palace was demolished between 1810 and 1816. Over the following decades it grew as a garrison town and a local centre for trade.


=== Industrialization ===

A textile factory, later known as the Royal Military Textile Factory, had already been established in Usserød in the 1790s(closed 1981). It was later joined by other industrial enterprises, such as Hørsholm Textile Factory (1885-1975), Hørsholm Tobakspakkeri og Hørsholm Iron Foundry (1900-1965).


=== 20th-century growth ===
In the 20th century, Hørsholm gradually grew together with the neighbouring communities Usserød, Rungsted and Smidstrup. Most recently, Hørsholm has grown together with Kokkedal in Fredensborg-Humlebæk Municipality and Trørød, Vedbæk and Gammel Holte in Rudersdal Municipality.


== Nature, parks and open spaces ==
Hørsholm Slotshave, the former gardens of Hirschholm Palace, is the largest public park in Hørsholm. A little to the east of it lies Hørsholm Arboretum, part of the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science. Hørsholm Cemetery is Hørsholm's largest cemetery. Rungsted Beach is Hørsholm's most popular beach but bathing is also possible at Mikkelborg and from several other localities along the coast.
Hørsholm is surrounded by a number of small woodlands. They include Rungsted Hegn–Folehave Skov. Kokkedal Skov, Elleskoven and Stasevang Skov. The larger Jægersborg Hegn, which separates Hørsholm from Skodsborg to the south, adjoins the extensive UNESCO-LISTED deer park Jægersborg Dyrehave.


== Culture and attractions ==
Trommen  ("The Drum") is Hørsholm's principal cultural centre and also home to its main library. Hørsholm is home to several museums. Rungstedlund is the former home of the author Karen Blixen and is now home to the Karen Blixen Museum. The Danish Museum of Hunting and Forestry was based in the few surviving buildings from Hirschholm Palace, but i now moved to Randers. Hørsholm is only about 17 km (11 mi) from Jægersborg Dyrehave and Store Dyrehave and some 30 km (19 mi) from Gribskov, all three included in the recently UNESCO-listed Par force hunting landscape in North Zealand developed by King Christian V in the late 17th century for hunting deer with hounds. The adjacent Hørsholm Local History Museum contains a Struense exhibition. Gammel Holtegård plays host to temporary art exhibitions as well as a permanent archeological exhibition. The small Fuglsangshus is also used as a venue for changing art exhibitions.


== Economy ==
Hørsholm is linked to engineering consultancy and information technology. DTU science park, a science park now part of the Technical University of Denmark, is home to many technological start-ups.
Hørsholm Hospital used to be a major employer but has now closed.
The Danish roof window and skylight manufacturer VELUX has its company headquarters in Hørsholm.


== Transport ==
Rungsted Kyst Station and Kokkedal Station on the coast are located on Kystbanen and served by the Oresundtrains which continue to Copenhagen Airport and across the Øresund bridge to Sweden.The Hørsholm Highway (now Helsingør Highway) is Denmark's oldest highway and connects Hørsholm to Copenhagen to the south and Helsingør to the north.
