Between 2000 and 2009, a considerable amount of oil deposits, estimated at between 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion barrels, were discovered in Lake Albert and on the shores of the lake in Hoima District and the neighboring Buliisa District. An oil refinery, the Uganda Oil Refinery, is planned in Kabaale Village, Buseruka Sub-county, Hoima District, approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi), west of Hoima. An oil pipeline, the Uganda-Tanzania Crude Oil Pipeline, is also planned to evacuate crude oil to the Tanzanian Indian Ocean port of Tanga. Consequently, Hoima is poised to become a hub of economic activity.In January 2018, SBC Uganda Limited, a joint venture company between Colas Limited of the United Kingdom and SBI International Holdings of Uganda, started construction of Hoima International Airport, at Kabaale Village, Buseruka sub-county, Hoima District, approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi), by road, to the west-northwest of the city of Hoima.The first phase of construction, including the runway and cargo-handling facilities, is expected to be ready in 2020. This phase is primarily to support construction of the oil refinery. The second phase of construction, focused on the facilitation of passengers and boosting tourism and business, is expected to conclude in 2022. The project is expected to create about 1,000 jobs.Because of the increased economic activity in the area, Hoima has been upgraded to municipality status, with increased infrastructure to handle the new businesses and new residents. Land prices, rental rates, and other real estate costs in Hoima have gone up recently, as demand for real estate in the town and surrounding areas has increased.
