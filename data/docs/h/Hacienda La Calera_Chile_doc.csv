Arab Chileans are immigrants to Chile from the Arab world. Most are Christian and are the descendants of economic migrants from Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, who arrived in Chile in the mid-19th to early-20th centuries. Christians in the Middle East are ethnic groups, mainly Arabs, with other ethnic groups like an Aramean minority in the Levant and Iraq, Armenian refugees in the Levant and Copts in Egypt. 
Ethnically Arab Chileans are often called "Turks", (Spanish: Turcos) a term derive from the fact that they arrived from the Ottoman Turkish Empire.  Most arrived as members of the Eastern Orthodox church, but a minority became Roman Catholic.  A minority are Muslim.
It is estimated that 800,000 Chileans are natives from population from Arab lands and a smaller population of Arabs from modern days Turkey, chiefly descendants of immigrants from the Middle East (i.e. Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese and Middle East Armenians).Chile is home to a large population of immigrants, mostly Christian, from the Levant. Roughly 500,000 Palestinian descendants are believed to reside in Chile. And the effects of their migration are widely visible. The earliest such migrants came in the 1850s, with others arriving during World War I and later the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The Club Palestino is one of the most prestigious social clubs in Santiago. They are believed to form the largest Palestinian community outside of the Arab world. Aside from these migrants of previous decades, Chile has also taken in some Palestinian refugees in later years, as in April 2008 when they received 117 from the Al-Waleed refugee camp on the Syria–Iraq border near the Al-Tanf crossing. The situation in Gaza has led to increased hostility toward Jews in Chile.Historically, the Arabs of Chile were called Turks, Moors, Arabs, Lebanese, or Palestinians. In the past decade, most of the Arab immigration are Iraqis.The Christian Orthodox, built the  Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Santiago and All Chile in Santiago in 1917. It is a cathedral of the Church of Antioch with six parishes.


== History ==
The first Arabs in Chile first registered in a census carried out dates back to 1895, however, in 1854 and 1885 are some subjects of the Ottoman Empire, which could well be in Lebanon, Palestine or Syria, which were part of the Empire at the time.
The majority of Palestinians arrived in the early 20th century, fleeing the Ottoman Empire due primarily to professing the Christian religion, oppressive rule and then the economic situation and the outbreak of the First World War. Note that the Ottoman Turkish oppression (Sunnis) was reflected not only in the Christian minority in Syria, Palestine and Lebanon, but against Shiite Muslims who arrived in the entire Atlantic coast to be the majority in the region, and some spent via Argentina to Chile in the early 20th century located across the country bringing to their culture and work to the development of Chile.
On arrival, the Arabs were devoted to work primarily in the commercial sector. The Palestinian community, despite their cultural differences with Chilean society, managed to permeate an important part of the country's middle class, although some of its members have some of the greatest wealth of the country. Although the District Board, in Santiago and the city of La Calera were the main locations where they lived and traded for many years, in recent times they have moved over the city of Santiago de Chile, Las Condes, Providence, Ñuñoa and Recoleta.
The large influx Arab party began in 1860 and extends until 1900. It is estimated that the Arabs who came to America reached at one million people. Until 1918 the Palestinians migrated with Turkish passports. The output ports were Beirut, Haifa and Alexandria, and the journey was made via Genoa and Marseille.
The large concentrations of immigrants were Syrians, Palestinians, Lebanese and their descendants in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. It is estimated that there are 25 million people of Arab descent in Latin America.
By 1940, the Arab Guide de Chile estimated at 13,466 the number of Arabs in Chile.
61% of the Arabs in Chile are people who arrived (or whose descendants arrived) between 1900 and 1930. Over 60% of Arabs who came were between 10 and 30 years old.
In 1912, the Muerched, the first Chilean newspaper written in Arabic, began publication. It is estimated that there were at least 12 similar publications during the 40 years of immigration.
In addition to the strong influence and varied diversity in areas of national affairs, a fact which demonstrates the presence of the Arab population in Chile, is the call for at least 7 players who were Chilean-born Palestinians (as Roberto Bishara) in the Palestinian football team during the Asian qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup 2006.
