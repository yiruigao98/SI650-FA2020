=== Señor del Santo Entierro ===

The Señor del Santo Entierro (Lord of the Holy Burial) image is that of Jesus as he lay buried after the crucifixion. The story behind the image states that it appeared in Huauchinango about 400 years ago, carried to the city's Augustinian monastery by a mule driver, stopping overnight carrying a wooden crate. In the morning, the driver had disappeared but the crate remained. Out of respect, the crate was not opened for days and when it was, the image was discovered. Attempts to return it to the driver failed, so it was decided to house the image at the monastery's main church. The image has a reputation for being miraculous not only due to the large number of miracles attributed to it, but also because it appears not to have aged over the centuries. At some point in time in Huachinango's history, this image replaced Our Lady of the Assumption as patron saint.  However, the annual celebration to honor it was not officially declared until 26 February 1923. This annual event is celebrated by decorating the sanctuary in which the image lies, as well as traditional dancing and singing along with mass. The celebration reenacts the arrival of the image to the city. It begins in the La Aurora neighborhood, with older women decorated with flowers called Xochitonantzi dancing a dance called the Xochipitzahuac. This is then followed by a dance featuring fans. A procession follows, featuring a woman chosen to play the Virgin Mary, but as the Virgin of Guadalupe, who is also acknowledged as an incarnation of the Aztec goddess Tonantzin. The processional path is strewn with flowers as it makes its way to the images sanctuary church.


=== Feria de las Flores ===
The annual celebration of the Señor del Santo Entierro gave rise to the city's main commercial fair, the Feria de las Flores (Flower Fair), celebrating the main agricultural product of the municipality. It began in 1938 coinciding with the religious event and now runs for nine days beginning on the first Sunday of Lent. It includes dances, cockfights, charreada and parades. It exhibits locally grown flowers and ornamental plants such as azaleas along with cultural items such as paintings by local artists, films, plays and recitals. The highlight is the crowning of the Reina de las Flores (Flower Queen) done by the Governor of the state of Puebla. In 1982, the state began to promote the event nationally and internationally. It is still dedicated to the patron saint of the city, the Señor del Santo Entierro. The 2011 event brought in an estimated ten million pesos to the city.

Here a dominion was established, but it was conquered by Texcoco to become a tribute region. It would remain so until the fall of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The first Spanish ruler for the area was Juan de Jaso, who was in charge of the encomienda. It would remain like this until the 18th century, with the last encomendero being José Sarmiento de Valldares, Count of Moctezuma and Duke of Atlixco. In 1792, it became part of the Puebla province.During the 19th century, troops from the area fought in the Mexican War of Independence, the Mexican American War and the French Intervention in Mexico, especially the Battle of Puebla.
