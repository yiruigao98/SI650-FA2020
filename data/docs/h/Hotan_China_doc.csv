=== Critical reception ===
Omer Bashir of Dawn.com gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, ''In the end, while Hotal’s plot failed to connect on any emotional level, it raises important questions about our film industry, the mainly homogenous titles it brings forth and the lack of diversity in roles offered to female leads.''Tanveer Khadim, blogger of The Express Tribune wrote, ''Hotal, the work of a New York Film Academy graduate, Khalid Hasan Khan, offered nothing surreal and nothing to write home about.'' She concluded her review with upshot, ''All in all, Hotal is a freaky product, not a spine-chilling psycho-thriller.''Omair Alavi from HIPinPakistan.com also criticized the film's plot and stated, ''Hotal has all the ingredients of a psycho thriller except that the plot is beyond any logic whatsoever.'' He also disliked the film's music and commented, ''One cannot end the movie review without reflecting on the three items numbers – two songs and a dance sequence – that beat even the gandasa-endorsing cinema of the mid ’90s in vulgarity. It’s ironic that the Pakistani censor board didn't chop off these numbers, which were there only to add "colour" to the film.''In his review on ‘Stupid Six’ Pakistani movies of 2016, Omair Alavi placed the film on second number.


=== Box office ===
