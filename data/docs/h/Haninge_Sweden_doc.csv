Haninge Municipality (Haninge kommun) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in Handen, a part of the Stockholm urban area.
Haninge Municipality was formed in 1971 when Västerhaninge and Österhaninge were united.
The municipal coat of arms depicts a capercaillie from which the name Haninge is believed to have been derived (the German word hahn means capercaillie), while the anchor symbolizes the naval base in the municipality. The German word usage is supposedly from the old German Hansa traders who operated in the area.


== Geography ==
Haninge cherishes its nature, housing the southern parts of the scenic Stockholm archipelago. There are over 3,600 islands, islets and skerries belonging to the municipality, with the three largest islands being Utö, Ornö and Muskö. A car tunnel, the third longest in Sweden, connects Muskö to the mainland. The other two of the islands are reached with passenger and car ferries. Haninge is also an area with access to Tyresta National Park with a surrounding nature reserve. It has been protected to preserve its noted natural values, e.g. one of the largest sections of untouched forest in southern Sweden.
