Hennenman is a small town in the Free State goldfields in the Lejweleputswa District Municipality of the Free State province of South Africa. The settlement is unusual for the district as being supported by agriculture rather than the mining industry.


== History ==
Hennenman, which was built as a single railway station, was formerly denoted as Ventersburg Road. In 1927, it was renamed after local Afrikaner P.F. Hennenman, from Swartpan Farm.
In 1944, black South Africans were confined to a segregated enclave in southern Hennenman. During apartheid, this area was cleared by order of the government and nearly all then-residents relocated to a new township some fifteen kilometres away, Vergenoeg (Afrikaans for "Far enough", now Phomolong).
