Hyattsville is a city in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States, and also a close, urban suburb of Washington, D.C. The population was 17,557 at the 2010 United States Census.


== History ==
Before Europeans reached the area, the upper Anacostia River was home to Nacotchtank/Anaquashtank people, a Piscataway-speaking Algonquian peoples who lived throughout what is now the Washington, D.C. area. European encroachment and diseases decimated their population and by the 1680s the Nacotchtank/Anaquashtank had largely moved away and merged with other tribes. In the 1720s, John Beall acquired land in the area and established Beall Town, but the town did not prosper like its neighbor Baldensburg. The opening of the Washington–Baltimore Turnpike (modern day  US 1) in 1812 and the B&O Railroad Washington Branch line in 1835 brought more settlers to the area.The city's founder, Christopher Clark Hyatt (1799–1884), purchased his first parcel of land in the area in 1845. Hyatt opened a store and began mail delivery, officially naming the nascent community "Hyattsville" in his 1859 application to become postmaster. In the years following the Civil War, Hyatt and other local landowners subdivided their properties and sold lots, and the population of Hyattsville grew.  Hyattsville was incorporated as a city on April 7, 1886.The historic district of the city is home to a number of Victorian houses built in the late 1880s and Sears bungalows and Arts & Crafts houses built between the wars (late 1910s and early 1940s). Historic Hyattsville is roughly bounded by East West Highway to the north; Route 1 to the east; the 38th Street Neighborhood Park to the south, and Queens Chapel Road to the west.

== In popular culture ==
The city of Hyattsville has expressed concern that crime in non-Hyattsville locations sharing the same ZIP codes and unincorporated communities designated as "Hyattsville" by the United States Postal Service creates an image problem for the city.
The city was involved in a minor controversy in April 2006. In the episode airing April 27, the Geena Davis television series Commander in Chief depicted Hyattsville as having twelve murders in six months; it also indirectly depicted the city as being an urban ghetto dominated by poor minorities. The city and Prince George's County were very upset at ABC. On May 1, ABC formally apologized to both the city and county.The violent crime rate per 1,000 residents has significantly decreased, from 11.42 in 2007 to 5.59 in 2012.In 2017, the Hyattsville City Police Department became the first law enforcement agency in the United States to put a Chevrolet Bolt (All-Electric) Fully Marked Police Patrol Vehicle into service.  It has since added an All-Electric Police Motorcycle, and Six Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations, which are free to use by the public.  Click here for video
