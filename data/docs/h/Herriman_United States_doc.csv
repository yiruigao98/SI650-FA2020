The city has experienced rapid growth since incorporation in 1999, as its population was just 1,523 at the 2000 census.

== History ==


=== Founding ===
Herriman was established in 1851 by Henry Harriman, Thomas Jefferson Butterfield, John Jay Stocking, and Robert Cowan Petty. A fort was established where the community garden is today. The only remnants of Fort Herriman are the two black locust trees that stand where the entrance to the fort once was. The Fort was abandoned in 1857 as the Johnston Army came West.


=== Incorporation ===
Herriman remained a small community until 1999 when proactive citizens including Brett Wood and J. Lynn Crane went door to door asking people to sign a petition to be incorporated into a town. In 1998 Rose Creek Estates, developed by Watt Homes, started the first "subdivision" with property under 1 acre. Later, Rosecrest, a land developer who acquired some rights in a large area around Herriman, and started large scale residential development. Rosecrest is owned by parent company Sorenson Companies founded by the late James LeVoy Sorenson and currently managed by his son. In 2007, Rosecrest won a lawsuit with partner land owners/developers that allowed about 4,000 acres (16 km2) to be annexed out of neighboring city Bluffdale into Herriman to further expand the Rosecrest/Herriman housing projects. The lawsuit stemmed from a struggle between Bluffdale city officials, strict city building requirements, and Rosecrest. The addition of Rosecrest greatly brought up Herriman's population and enabled the town to be turned into a city.

The main line broke due to a gardening tool hitting the water line.
