This is a list of the largest cities and towns in Belarus, including cities with population of over 5000, as assembled by the National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus. Neither Belarusian nor Russian have equivalent words to English "city" and "town". The word horad or gorod (Belarusian: горад, Russian: город) is used for both. But Belarusian legislature provides the three-level hierarchy.

According to the Law under May 5, 1998, the categories of the most developed urban localities in Belarus are as follows:

city of oblast (voblasć) subordinance (Belarusian: горад абласнога падпарадкавання, Russian: город областного подчинения) — urban locality with the population of not less than 50,000 people; it has its own body of self-government, known as Council of Deputies (Belarusian: Савет дэпутатаў, Russian: совет депутатов) and an executive committee (Belarusian: выканаўчы камітэт, Russian: исполнительный комитет), which stand on the level with these of a raion (Belarusian: раён).
