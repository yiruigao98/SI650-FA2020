Himatnagar or Himmatnagar is a municipality in Sabarkantha district in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative headquarters of the district. The city is on the bank of the river Hathmati.


== History ==
Himatnagar was founded in 1426 by Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat Sultanate and named it Ahmednagar after himself. He founded the town to keep Raos of Idar State in check. It is said that he was so fond of the place that he thought of making it, instead of Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat Sultanate.
When the Rao dynasty took Idar in 1728, Ahmednagar soon fell into their hands. After the death of Maharaja Shivsing, in 1792, his brother Sangramsing took Ahmednagar and the country around; and, in spite of the efforts of his nephew Gambhirsing, became an independent chief. Sangramsing was succeeded by his son Karansing. The later died in 1835, and Erskine, the British Agent, who was in the neighbourhood with a force, moved to Ahmednagar to prevent the queens from becoming satis. The sons of the deceased Maharaja begged Erskine not to interfere with their customs. Finding him resolved to prevent the sati practice, while pretending to negotiate, they secretly summoned the Bhils and other turbulent tribes, and in the night, opening a way through the fort wall to the river bed, the queens burnt themselves with their deceased husband. The sons of the deceased Maharaja fled, but subsequently gave themselves up, and, after entering into an engagement with the British Government, Takhtsing was allowed to succeed his father as Maharaja of Ahmednagar. Some years later he was chosen to fill the vacant throne of Jodhpur State. He tried to keep Ahmednagar and its dependencies, but, after a long discussion, it was, in 1848, ruled that Ahmednagar should revert to Idar State.
In 1912, the town was renamed Ahmednagar to Himatnagar after prince Himmat Singh by Sir Pratap Singh, the Maharaja of Idar. The state was under Mahi Kantha Agency during British rule which subsequently became part of Western India States Agency.Among various old businesses with relevance to history of Himatnagar, Himat Vijay Printing Press (established in 1931) was named after King Himat Singh and was owned and operated by Late Shri Chhotalal Narsinhdas Shah (and his family still runs it) and he was longest servicing President of Himantagar Panchyant before it became municipality. The main road through City across to Municipal office has been named as C N Shah Road and parallel road has been named after famous Dr Nalinkant Gandhi, as Dr Nalinkant Gandhi Road. Municipal Town Hall has also been named as "Dr Nalinkant Gandhi Town Hall".
After independence of India in 1947, Idar State was merged with Union of India. From 1947 to 1956, it was a part of Bombay State as Idar district. Himatnagar was the largest city and the administrative headquarters of the Dungarpur district, Rajasthan from 1956 to 1960. Since 1961, Himatnagar is the administrative headquarter and part of Sabarkantha district of Gujarat.


== Places of interest ==

The white sandstone and cement walls of the original fort, though much ruined in parts still surround the heart of town. The gateways, especially the Prantij or Ahmedabad gate, are specimens of Muslim architecture. The bastions are hollow the inside occupied by pillared rooms in two stories which take up so much space that the walls of the bastions are composed of single layers of stone. In the town, a small stone building, with richly carved bow windows, was once the residence of the Maharajas of Ahmednagar. There are also some interesting Jain temples.Further on is a well, known as the Kazi ni Vavdi, with inscriptions on the side walls, one in Arabic and the other in Devnagri, bearing respectively the dates 1417 (820 Hijri year) and 1522 (Samvat 1578). The second inscription shows that the well was built in 1522 by Shamsher-ul-Mulk, who is stated by tradition to have been a son of Sultan Ahmed Shah. Further, the citadel or inner fort, known like that in Ahmedabad as the Bhadra, contains some very fine though ruinous buildings, the principal lacing that traditionally known as the Mulla or Mohina Rani's palace. Tho windows of these buildings are very fine, of stone carved with the delicacy of lace. There are several wells hewn out of the solid rock, and, though dry, in good preservation. In 1858, the principal building in the Bhadra was occupied as a mess-house by a small force sent to keep order in the Mahi Kantha during the troubled times of the Mutinies. It has since become a ruin. Outside, at some distance from the Bhadra and opening immediately on the Hathmati river, is the Idar gate, is close to it is a small mosque in perfect preservation, its windows worthy of notice, being each ornamented outside with a carved stone canopy while the frame is filled with carved stone work representing trees with foliage, through the interstices of which, a tempered light streams into the building. This mosque is said to have been built by Nasar-ul-Mulk, the eldest son of Sultan Ahmed Shah I.East of this mosque is the Navlakha Kund. It is an oblong hollow or pit about 100 feet broad and 500 feet long. At the foot of the flight of steps, which form one of the sides of the pit, is a stone basin, filled with water from a perennial spring and with stone cloisters round three of its sides. At the back of the west cloister is a ladies gallery hidden from sight by carved open stone screens. On the south side is a building with a stone canopy intended for the king or chief man of the place, who during the heat of the day came with his ladies to enjoy this cool retreat. The cloister on the north has disappeared, but the others, in fair preservation, are fine specimens of architecture. Tradition ascribes the work to Taj-ul-Mulk, another of the sons of Sultan Ahmed. Close to this place are the remains of buildings said to have been stables or cavalry lines. At one side of these, large arched doorways, now built up, led to an outwork facing the north, and immediately over the river, which was evidently at one time covered with a pillared roof. This was probably a place of resort, being cool, except at noon-day, and commanding a fine view of the Idar hills. Not far from the stables, a gateway opens on the road to the river, On the other side of the road three domed and pillared cupolas, chhatris mark the spots where the remains of the Maharajas of Ahmedabad were cremated.Maharaja Himmat Singh Fort, located on the banks of river Hathmati and Daulat Vilas Palace in Mahavirnagar area are two remaining palaces.
