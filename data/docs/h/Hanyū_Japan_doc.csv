== Geography ==
Hanyū is located in the most northern part of Saitama Prefecture on the island of Honshu, Japan. Hanyū's northern border is the Tone River. Before the river was redirected to its current course to control flooding, it used to flow through the city. This river was used as a major shipping route for locally produced textiles and goods from further up river. Hanyū flourished as a stopping point on the long ride toward Tokyo. Today only an irrigation channel remains in the approximate location of the original river path.
