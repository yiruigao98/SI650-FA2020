Hermosillo (American Spanish: [eɾmoˈsiʝo] (listen)), formerly called Pitic (as in Santísima Trinidad del Pitic and Presidio del Pitic), is a city located in the center of the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora. It is the capital and largest city as well as the main economic center for the state and the region. As of 2015, the city has a population of 812,229, making it the 16th largest city in Mexico. The recent city population increase is due to its recent strong industrialization, especially in the automotive industry.
Hermosillo was ranked as one of the five best cities to live in in Mexico, as published in the study "The Most Livable Cities of Mexico 2013" by the Strategic Communications Cabinet of the Federal Government. Hermosillo also ranked as the seventh most competitive city in the country according to the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO) based on factors such as its economic diversification, geographical location, access to education, government, innovation and international relations, according to the urban combativity analysis released by that institution in 2016. Since the 1980s, the major manufacturing sector is automobiles.
Hermosillo has a subtropical hot desert climate (BWh). Temperatures can reach 48 °C (118.4 °F) in the summer months, making it one of the hottest cities in the country.


== History ==

Evidence from a site called the San Dieguito Complex, located in the El Pinacate Zone, suggests the area has been inhabited for about 3,000 years. Evidence of agriculture dates back 2,500 years. In the pre-Hispanic era, this area was inhabited by the Seri, Tepoca, and Pima peoples.The first encounter between the Spanish and the indigenous peoples of the area occurred in the middle of the 16th century, when European explorers were sent in search of nonexistent gold. The first missionaries arrived in the state of Sonora around 1614, and Eusebio Francisco Kino arrived in 1687, founding a mission in nearby Cucurpe. What are now the states of Sonora and Sinaloa, were loosely organized as the provinces of Sonora, Ostimura and Sinaloa.In 1700, three small Spanish villages were founded in what is now the outskirts of Hermosillo: Nuestra Señora del Pópulo, Nuestra Señora de Los Angeles and la Santísima Trinidad del Pitic. The native peoples here soon became hostile to the colonists and managed to drive them out several times in the early 18th century. In 1716, the Spanish offered irrigated lands for farmers to the native peoples, who then agreed to abide by Spanish law. Around 1726, a fort named the Presidio of Pitic was constructed to stop the domination of this area by the natives, especially the Seri. However, the situation remained contentious, the first church was not built until 1787, and the first formal parish was not established until 1822.During the Mexican War of Independence, Sonora and the town of Pitic stayed loyal to the Spanish Crown. In fact, a general from this area, Alejo García Conde, defeated insurgent José María González Hermosillo, who had been sent here by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. In 1825, the village of Pitic was made the seat of the department of the same name. In 1828, the settlement changed its name to Hermosillo to honor José María González de Hermosillo.
A battle between imperial and republican forces occurred here in 1866 during the French Intervention in Mexico. In 1879, the capital of the state of Sonora was moved from Arizpe to Hermosillo. In 1881 the railroad linking Hermosillo with Guaymas and Nogales was finished, allowing for economic expansion in the area by bringing in mining equipment and modern agricultural equipment. Since then, the city has been an economic center for northwest Mexico.During the Mexican Revolution, forces loyal to Pancho Villa were repulsed by General Manuel M. Diéguez. After the assassination of Francisco I. Madero in 1913, Venustiano Carranza, then governor of Coahuila, sought refuge in Hermosillo. Here Carranza began the Constitutionalist Movement, and because of this, Hermosillo has the nickname of the "revolutionary capital of the country."From the late 19th century and through the first two decades of the 20th, Chinese immigrants came into Sonora state. A significant number settled in the city of Hermosillo. Some of these immigrants established businesses, especially shoe manufacturing and clothing. Some of the most successful Chinese-owned businesses in Sonora were based in Hermosillo and sold their merchandise to other parts of the country. However, by the 1920s anti-Chinese sentiment had become strong in Sonora state, with many Chinese leaving for Mexico City or the United States.In the 1980s, Ford built a plant here, which had a great impact on the city's and state's economy.Hermosillo is the site of a tragic fire at the ABC child care center on June 5, 2009. According to the Procuraduría General de Justicia en el Estado (State Attorney General Office) of Sonora, 49 deaths were attributed to the fire at the ABC child care center. The fire apparently started at a car and tire depot, then spread to the child care center. Most of the children died of asphyxiation. There were about 100 children inside the building and firefighters had to knock holes in the walls to rescue the children, who ranged in age from six months to five years.


=== Origins ===
The origin of Hermosillo dates back to 1700, when the villages of Our Lady of The Pup, Our Lady of Angels and the Holy Trinity of Pitic, inhabited by yaquis, seris, tepocas and pimas bajo were founded.
Years earlier, internal difficulties had occurred among the Tepocas Indians with the low pimas and as a result, they had moved away from their duties.
The purpose of the city was to contain the Seris and Tepocas Indians, to protect the Hispanic expansion under the name of Real Presidio de San Pedro de la Conquista, named after the Viceroy Don Pedro de Castro y Figueroa, Duke of the Conquest and Marquis of Grace.  The explorer in charge of the foundation of the peoples was John the Baptist of Escalante, who managed to pacify the situation, on May 18, 1700, giving a speech, of which this part is reproduced:
Sending them to have no wars from now on, but to live as Christians and to deal with each other with fairs of the clothes of their use and seeds of their plantings, to which they responded from one and the other, which they would do thank ingsands thank ing best for the good that they made peace of way.', 
In 1718, on the orders of the governor Manuel de San Juan y Santa Cruz, the town of the Holy Trinity of Pitic was repopulated; on September 29, 1725 the sers settled in the Pópulo rose in the son of war and invaded the people of Opodepe. The sery were persecuted for the purpose of punishing them until they signed the peace in January 1726, and they were settled in the Porplo and in the points called Alares and Moraga; subsequently given the uncertainty due to the bellicoseness of the indigenous, the Pitic presidio was formed.


==== The Presidio of Saint Peter of the Conquest of the Pitic ====
In June 1741, Don Agustin of Vildósola established the presidio of St. Peter of the Conquest of the Pitic.
Nine years later the troops of the Pupium were transferred to El Pópulo, in the present municipality of San Miguel de Horcasitas. As a result of this action the Pitic was left in a very precarious situation, because several residents emigrated for fear of the Seris.
While the Presidio's settlement was about to disappear, senior authorities ordered a group of soldiers to remain on site to ensure the safety of their neighbours.
In 1772, the mayor Pedro de Corbalán ordered the construction of a canal on the left bank of the [Rio Sonora], to irrigate the lands and orchards.
Pitic's Villa .A.
Before the end of the eighteenth century the former Presidio of San Pedro de la Conquista del Pitic became Villa del Pitic.
On February 9, 1825, the Villa del Pitic was established as the head of the party, dependent on the department of Horcasitas. This coincided with the urbanization that the royal surveyors gave it, as it progressed steadily.
In 1827, the city had approximately eight thousand inhabitants, and its urbanization was very particular, as the houses were scattered in all directions. The region was fertile, well-cultivated and provided an abundance of what was necessary for life and even many luxuries. Already then it was, very cheap, high quality beef that to this day is famous.


==== The Village of Hermosillo ====
On September 5, 1828, by decree no. 77 of the H. Legislature of the State of the West, the name Villa del Pitic was deleted and the name of the City of Hermosillo was imposed, in honor of the general Jalisco-jalisciense José María González de Hermosillo who in the late 1810 had carried the task of the national insurrection to lands Sinaloa-Sinaloenses, then part of the Western State as well.
On March 12, 1831, the State of Sonora was founded and Hermosillo was its first capital from 14 May of that year to May 25, 1832, when the capital powers were transferred to the city of Arizpe. In 1837, the city was erected at the head of the district of its name. Also on that date Don Pascual Iñigo began the construction of the Chapel of Our Lady of Carmen.
He also points out that on October 14, 1852, in the city, a section of filibusters under the command of Gastón de Raousset-Boulbon faced and defeated the national forces, who were under the leadership of General Miguel Blanco de Estrada; this as part of a revolutionary campaign of independence that was intended to turn Sonora and Lower California into colonial territories France However, Raousset remained only a few days in the city, choosing to go to Guaymas to continue his campaign where he would eventually be defeated by General José María Yáñez Carrillo in [Battle of Guaymas] (1854).
On May 4, 1866, under Second Mexican Empire of Maximilian of Habsburg, the republican troops commanded by the general Ángel Martínez attacked and seized the city, which was defended by Second Mexican Empire, under Colonel María Tranquilino Almada. However, a few hours later it fell back into the hands of the forces of the empire. On November 13, 1866, General Martinez again took the city again in blood and fire, causing the imperialists to flee, who regained it eight days later.
In 1879 Hermosillo was once again the headquarters of state powers, thanks to the management of the acting governor Don Francisco Serna, at least on an interim date. However, when the new Political Constitution of the State of Sonora was issued on September 15, 1917, it was definitively confirmed that the city of Hermosillo is the headquarters of the state powers, as referred to in article 28 thereof.On November 4 in front of the wooden station of Sonora dozens of people gathered at the opening of the Guaymas-Hermosillo railway section. On the train came Don Carlos Rodrigo Ortiz Retes, accompanied by the commander of the Military Zone, brigadier Colonel José Guillermo Carbó. Months later, the cargo and passenger service would be established between Guaymas and the Nogales (Sonora)' Noals.


=== 20th century ===

At the beginning of the 20th century, Hermosillo had about 14,000 inhabitants. During the Mexican Revolution, forces loyal to Francisco 'Pancho' Villa were expelled from the city by the General Manuel M. Diéguez. After the assassination of Francisco I. Madero in 1913, Venustiano Carranza, then governor of Coahuila sought refuge in Hermosillo. Here Carranza began the Constitutionalist Movement, because of this, Hermosillo has the nickname "the revolutionary capital of the country'".
In the late 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century, Chinese immigrants arrived in Sonora. One of the settlements with a significant number was the city of Hermosillo. Some of these immigrants had money and used it to set up businesses, especially shoe and clothing manufacturing. Some of the most successful businesses with Chinese owners in Sonora were in Hermosillo and sold merchandise to other parts of the country. However, in the [20years] a sentiment against the Chinese population in Sonora was strengthened, resulting in many fleeing to Mexico City or the United States.
In the 80s, Ford built Hermosillo Stamping & Assembly in the city, which had a major impact on the city's economy and the state. A whole chain of suppliers was also developed around the assembly plant, which further contributed to economic growth in Hermosillo. Hermosillo was selected due in part to her closeness to the United States.


=== 21st century ===

In 2000 the businessman Pancho Búrquez was elected as municipal president for National Action, in that triennium, the municipality won national awards (such as that of the Secretariat of Comptroller ship and Administrative Development of the federal government, as well as of the International City/County Management Association as one of the most transparent cities in the world. Investment grew in the early decade thanks to the ease of doing business.
One of the most important events in Hermosillo was the event of the ABC Nursery Fire on June 5, 2009. According to the Attorney General's Office of the State of Sonora, there were 49 deaths in the ABC nursery fire. The fire apparently began in a warehouse with government documents planning to disappear, then expanded to daycare. Most of the children died of asphyxiation. There were about 100 children inside the building, firefighters and the population had to make holes in the walls to rescue the children, ranging from six months to five years. surname a stir both nationally and internationally and society's demand for justice.

== Geography ==
As the municipal seat, the city of Hermosillo is the local government of over 3,800 other localities, with a combined territory of 14,880.2 square kilometres (5,745.3 sq mi).The two most important rivers are the Sonora and the San Miguel. Both of these are used for irrigation purposes with the Abelardo L. Rodriguez Dam located on the San Miguel River. The population increase of the municipality, currently at 2.5% annually, puts pressure on the infrastructure of the city, especially its water supply. Decades of overpumping of ground water has led to the aquifer levels being lower than sea levels, and sea water creeping in as an "artificial recharge."


=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Hermosillo features a hot desert climate (BWh). Temperatures can range from as low as freezing in December and January to 48 °C (118.4 °F) in June and July. Rain falls mostly between July and September, with annual precipitation between 75 and 300 millimetres (3.0 and 11.8 in). Most of the vegetation here consists of mesquite trees as well as trees such as the desert ironwood, palo verde and the huisache. Desert animals such as the desert tortoise, rattlesnakes, bighorn sheep and lynx are the most notable species. Populations of feral red-masked parakeets and monk parakeets are a local sightseeing attraction here.
Hermosillo's all-time weather record for high temperature is 49.5 °C (121.1 °F), which was achieved in June 2014. In recent years, the lowest temperature was −4 °C (24.8 °F), in December.

== Economy ==

Most of the municipality's population lives in the city proper, with most jobs located in the manufacturing and commerce sectors here. About 250,000 hectares are under cultivation in the city's outskirts, most of which is near the coast. Crops include wheat, grapes, flowers, chickpeas, alfalfa and walnuts. Livestock has been traditionally important here, especially beef cattle. Pigs, sheep, goats, horses, domestic fowl and bees are also raised here as well. Fishing is practiced along the coast with shrimp being the most important catch.Industry and manufacturing has been the most dynamic sector of the economy. Much of this began in the 1980s with the establishment of the automobile industry, specifically the Hermosillo Stamping & Assembly plant owned and operated by Ford Motor Company. Electronics and IT are the largest employers by both revenue and number of employees. Today, there are twenty-six major manufacturers, which generate about 68,300 jobs, employing about thirty percent of the population.
Other than cars, products manufactured here include televisions, computers, food processing, textiles, wood products, printing, cellular phones, chemicals, petroleum products and plastics. Lanix electronics has a major research and design facility and its main manufacturing plant in Hermosillo. The city and its municipality have twelve industrial parks, which house over one hundred smaller manufacturing enterprises. There has been slowing of this sector especially the automobile industry because of the global economic downturn that began in 2008.Commerce employs more than half of the population; besides small local businesses, chains are well represented; these are locally, regionally (Northwest Mexico), nationally, and U.S.-based. Tourism is mostly limited to the coastal communities of Bahia de Kino, Kino Nuevo and Punta Chueca, where there are cave paintings and a recreational park named La Sauceda.

As the city is located on a plain in the Sonoran Desert, surrounded by flat areas with grass, behind which are greener hills that are then framed by serrated peaks in the background, the city is a common stopover for North Americans traveling by car toward the coast, and is the only city in Mexico that purifies all drinking water before it goes to homes. The city is the major economic center for the state, with about thirty percent of the state's population living in the city.The center of the city is Plaza Zaragoza, built in 1865, in which there is a Moorish-style kiosk, which was brought from Florence, Italy in the early 20th century. The plaza also has a flower garden and statues of General Ignacio Pesqueira and General García Morales.The plaza is framed by the State Government Palace and the cathedral. The Palacio de Gobierno, Spanish for "Government Palace," was constructed in 1881, using stone from the nearby Cerro de la Campana mountain, has a white Neoclassical façade, with a central body that extends slightly more in front than the rest. This central body is flanked by Ionic columns and is topped by a semicircular pediment and a clock tower. The side wings have an aligned series of windows on the first level and balconies on the second, with the corners having thick pilasters. The interior has one patio with a main staircase, decorated with murals done between 1982 and 1984 by Teresa Moran, Enrique Estrada and Héctor Martínez Arteche, depicting scenes from Sonora's history. The building was officially inaugurated in 1906 and reflects elements of French style, which was popular at the time.

The cathedral, named the Catedral de la Asunción, is located next to Plaza Zaragoza. It was begun in the 18th century but was not finished until the beginning of the 20th. However, the first chapels associated with the cathedral were begun in the 18th century. Construction of the cathedral began in 1861 and is a mix of predominantly Neoclassical architecture with Neogothic decorative elements. The main entrance is flanked by paired columns on pedestals and the smaller side doors are topped with semicircular pediments. Above the main doors are two ogival or pointed windows, over which is a crest with a balustrade.

Today, it houses a museum mostly dedicated to the indigenous cultures of the state, including crafts, clothing, customs and ways of life.The Plaza Hidalgo area of the city was a very fashionable area during the first half of the 20th century when a number of the wealthy and influential of the city built homes here. Today, many of these constructions now house institutions such as the Instituto Sonorense de Cultura, the Colegio de Sonora, Radio Sonora, the Colegio Library and the Colegio de Notarios. Each weekend, the plaza becomes a cultural center, hosting various activities and events such as concerts, exhibitions, theatrical works and more.The Cerro de la Campana mountain is one of the symbols of Hermosillo. Its summit is 350 metres (1,150 ft) above the valley floor and contains a lookout called El Caracol, which was inaugurated in 1909. There are two theories as to the origin of the mountain's name. One states that it is from a peculiar metallic sound that is made when the mountain's rocks fall against each other. The other is based on the bell-like shape of the elevation.Just outside the city proper on the highway to Guaymas is the Centro Ecológico de Sonora (Ecological Center of Sonora). The center has more than 300 species of plants and 200 species of animals from both Sonora and other parts of the world. All of the animals live in recreated natural habitats. The Sonoran collection is part of one of CES's main functions, which is to preserve the flora and fauna of the state. The collection contains representations of animals and plants from the four main habitats of the state: mountains, grassland, desert and sea. Some of the species are in danger of extinction such as the bighorn sheep, the white-tailed deer as well as a number of bird and reptile species.The Dr. Alfonso Ortiz Tirado Festival has been an annual event since 1985 and is the most important cultural event in northwest Mexico. It takes place in Hermosillo and a number of other municipalities in the state.
