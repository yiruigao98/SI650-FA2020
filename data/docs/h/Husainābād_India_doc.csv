In 2010, the district administration decided to replace the clock. But then two samaritans Captain Paritosh Chauhan and Akhilesh Agarwal approached the administration to allow them to repair it so that the mechanical clock is not replaced with an electronic one. It was Captain Chauhan's passion and love for his city that he requested the then DM, Amit Ghosh to give him a chance to repair it. They worked on it for three years and reconstructed the entire clock on a pro bono basis.
On 13 April 2010, they began working and were able to make the defunct clock functional by 28 October 2010. Finally, on 13 September 2011, they made the giant clock tower chime, after a silence of 27 long years.
