When hostile ships approached the community, the inhabitants of Huddinge would climb to high locations and light beacons. Beacons were located around the entirety of Lake Mälaren. Huddinge's coat of arms has its origins in this tradition. The name Huddinge is believed to come from the Uddung's - the first inhabitants in this area, which during the Iron Age lived on the shores of Lake Mälaren nearby Vårby.

== Split into two municipalities ==
After years of debate a vote is planned was 2008 regarding a split of Huddinge into two different municipalities named in published documents as Huddinge and Huddinge östra ("Huddinge East").
The intention with a split is to make the eastern part of Huddinge its own municipality after years of protests from inhabitants.
Due to large protests it was decided in 2007 to hold a vote regarding the split. However it was proposed that only the inhabitants of eastern Huddinge would be allowed to vote. This has caused a major political split of opinions as the political opposition wants to see a vote. At least 60% of the inhabitants of eastern Huddinge must vote yes for the split to be performed.
The referendum ended with a clear no to the split, ending the discussion.
