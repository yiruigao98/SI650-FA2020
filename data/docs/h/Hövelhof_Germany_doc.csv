== Description ==

Unusually for a village as small as Hövelhof, it is relatively self-contained—there are numerous supermarkets, restaurants, clothes shops, travel agencies, pubs and much more, meaning that the village could theoretically remain independent of the city of Paderborn. In fact, the only common feature of a full-fledged town that is missing from Hövelhof is a cinema, for which inhabitants do indeed need to venture into Paderborn City Center—approximately 15 km (10 mi) away. It also has five schools, its own fire brigade, and a library.


== Culture ==
Hövelhof has two main festivals during the year. The first is the Schützenfest, a celebration of the St. Hubertus Hunters' Guild, which takes place on the hunting grounds. The second is the Hövelmarkt, a general village fair with not only market stalls, but also fairground rides and traditional German dances, complete with traditional music and costume.


== Politics ==
The local government is dominated by the conservative CDU.
