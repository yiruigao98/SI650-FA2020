In 1579 the encomendero was Diego de Santillán and in 1607 it passed to Martín de Palomar. In 1616 the encomenderos were Diego García de Montalvo, Jacinto de Montalvo y Olmos, and Martín de Montalvo y Figueroa, but by 1678 it had passed to Diego Tello de Aguillar.Yucatán declared its independence from the Spanish Crown in 1821 and in 1825, the area was assigned to the Camino Real Bajo region with its headquarters in Hunucmá Municipality, which was head of Chocholá, Halachó, Kinchil, Kopomá, Maxcanú, Opichén, Samahil, Tetiz, and Umán.
