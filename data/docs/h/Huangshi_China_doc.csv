In 845 BC Marquis Wen (文侯) Huang Meng (黃孟), or Huang Zhang (黃璋) moved the capital of the State of Huang from Yicheng to Huangchuan (present-day Huangchuan, Henan).

The people of Huang were forced to relocate to Chu. They settled in the region of present-day Hubei province, in a region known as the Jiangxia Prefecture (江夏郡) during the Han dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).

== Transportation ==

The prefecture-level city is served by G45 Daqing–Guangzhou Expressway, G50 Shanghai–Chongqing Expressway, National Highways 106 and 316 and Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway.  The city has two Yangtze River crossings, the Huangshi Yangtze River Bridge and the Edong Yangtze River Bridge.
Many of the passenger trains traveling on the Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway between Wuhan (Wuchang and Wuhan Stations) and the points southeast make stops at the Huangshi and Yangxin stations. The Huangshi Station is located within the administrative borders of Daye County-level city (30°9′23″N 114°56′5″E), about 5 km (3 mi) north of downtown Daye and 10 km (6 mi) west of downtown Huangshi. The Yangxin Station is near Yangxin County's county seat, Xingguo Town.
Although Huangshi's main urban area is some distance away from the  Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway mainline, it is connected to it by a dead-end branch, of considerable importance for the local industries. It runs all the way to Huangshi's river port on the Yangtze. There was even a downtown passenger station on this branch (Huangshi East Railway Station, 30°12′25″N 115°5′5″E), but, as of 2012, it was served by very few trains, and by 2015, was not in operation anymore.
In 2014, the Wuhan-Huangshi line of the Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway opened. The three stations of this commuter rail system in the Huangshi area are Huahu (花湖站), Huangshi North and Daye North. Huahu, although technically situated within the boundaries of Ezhou City, is actually located on the north-western edge of Huangshi's central city (30.263600°N 115.016645°E﻿ / 30.263600; 115.016645); Haungshi North is in Xialu District, in the western part of Huangshi's central city; the Daye North station is north-east of Daye (30.125216°N 114.995895°E﻿ / 30.125216; 114.995895).
