== History ==
Hendersonville was settled circa 1784 by Daniel Smith when he began work on his Rock Castle.In 1790, William Henderson settled in Sumner County and later became the namesake of the town. It was a trading center for the county, which was devoted to the production of tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, and blood livestock: both horses and cattle. During the Civil War, Monthaven was used as a field hospital. In the late 20th century, this historic home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1901, when the small city was incorporated, it had roughly 250 residents and was led by L.H. "Dink" Newman.With the completion of the Old Hickory Dam in 1954, Hendersonville started to develop more rapidly, as the lake attracted sportsmen and people seeking recreation. Since the late 20th century, it has become the most-populous city of Sumner County, and one of the most populous suburbs of Nashville, along with Franklin and Murfreesboro. The city contains around 0.7% of the population of Tennessee.

Hendersonville is governed by a board of 12 aldermen and a mayor, known as the Board of Mayor and Aldermen (BOMA). The aldermen are elected by district for staggered terms of four years. The mayor is elected once every four years by the whole city.


=== Flood scare ===
In 2007 a risk was identified that the trouble-prone Wolf Creek Dam in the neighboring state of Kentucky might break, which could have resulted in a complete inundation for the lower lying parts of Hendersonville. Since then, extensive repairs have been performed on the dam, and the maximum level of water behind it has been lowered, thus reducing the pressure of water on the structure and resolving the identified flood risk.
