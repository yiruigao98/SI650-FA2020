== Toponymy and history ==
Oregon Country pioneers Reese and Sarah J. Anderson were Hazel Dell's first settlers. Sarah named the area after a stand of filberts on their land near what is today 78th Street and Highway 99. She also donated the land for the first school in Hazel Dell. The name "Bear Gulch" was briefly considered by the early Hazel Dell residents.Hazel Dell and Minnehaha were two of the first suburban areas to be developed after World War II and were followed by Lake Shore, Felida, and Salmon Creek. Much of the housing boom in this area has subsided due to the increase of homes being built to the east of Vancouver, between Interstate 205 and Camas and Washington State Route 500/Fourth Plain Boulevard and the Columbia River.
Until the early 1970s, it was not uncommon to see horses and dairy cattle at several points along Interstate 5 and Highway 99 where there are now shopping centers. Children during that time often made money for school clothes and summer activities by picking strawberries, raspberries, beans and other vegetables at several farms in the area. After new child labor laws went into effect restricting children under 12 from working, most farm owners turned to "direct to customer" U-pick. There are now only a few small acreage farms left in Hazel Dell and no dairies at all.


=== Hazel Dell Parade of Bands ===
Every third Saturday in May since 1964, Hazel Dell has hosted the "Parade of Bands". The parade route follows Hwy 99 North to 78th Street, west to Hazel Dell Avenue, south to 63rd Street and back to Highway 99. The parade was first organized and sponsored by Harvey Johnson and family who owned the now demolished Steakburger Drive-in restaurant on Highway 99.


=== Hazel Dell citizens ===
Local business leaders once considered changing the name to "Basilville" in honor of enterprising merchant Basil Dhanens. With thanks, Dhanens declined the offer. He died in 1972.
