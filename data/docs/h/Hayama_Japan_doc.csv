== History ==
During the Edo period, all of eastern Sagami Province was tenryō territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate, and administered by various hatamoto. During the cadastral reform of the early Meiji period in 1889, the area was reorganized into Hayama village through the merger of six hamlets. It was elevated to town status in 1925.


== Economy ==
Despite its lack of rail connections, Hayama is now primarily a commuter town for Tokyo and Yokohama and, due to its mild climate, a popular resort area with a marina. Agricultural produce includes shiitake mushrooms, and a brand of beef known as "Hayama-gyu".
A long time getaway for Tokyo's upper classes, Hayama has developed a reputation for being popular with actors and wealthy expats.
