The district has had a red-green coalition since 2004, interrupted by an SPD-FDP coalition from 2011 to 2014. After the CDU had become the strongest faction in the district for the first time in 2004, the SPD regained this position in 2008. The Greens became the strongest party in the district assembly elections on 26 May 2019. However, accusations of Islamism were made against two members, whereupon the faction constituted itself without these members.
