== History ==
The village was founded in 1308.Between 1945 and 1990 Heiligensee housed West Berlin's inner German border crossing for inland navigation on the Oder-Havel Canal. The crossing was open for freight vessels navigating between the People's Republic of Poland, or the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany (till 1949, thereafter the East German Democratic Republic) and West Berlin.
