Hanahan is located at the very south end of Berkeley County, and its city limits on the west and south sides are contiguous with the county line between Berkeley and Charleston counties. It was incorporated as a city in 1972.
Hanahan is bordered on the west and south by the city of North Charleston. To the east is the old Naval Weapons Station, which was formerly a submarine base, and is still federal property.

CSX Transportation has a main north-south track that runs along Hanahan's west city limit. Hanahan is primarily a residential city. It does have quite a number of major warehouses in the northeast and southeast portions of the city, most of whose business is tied directly to the Port of Charleston, aeronautics, logistics and the defense industries.
