At the edge of town, on the banks of the Samatsar lake, stands the finest example of the wooden architecture of the Royal Palaces of Gujarat. Other similar examples of palaces on the lake-shore in India are the palaces of Udaipur, Alwar, Datia and Mandu. The Halvad Palace Campus has all the elements of Rajput palaces - a zenana, a hall for public audience, a temple to the family goddess, a pleasure garden and administrative offices. The entry to the Halvad Palace is from the town. A beautifully carved entrance gate leads one to a huge courtyard. The formal square plan of two storied palace structure, adorned with exquisitely carved wooden columns, brackets, friezes and jalis with geometric patterns defines the courtyard. Four raised pathways, from the center of each side, meet in the middle of the courtyard at the base of the seven storied, octagonal tower, with jharokhas overlooking all eight directions. From the top of this tower, on a clear day, one can see the surrounding villages; therefore, it is popularly known as Jhalawad Darshan or EK-Dandia Mahal. The long facade, with carved stone jharokhas, brings in the cool breeze as it overlooks the lake. The jharokhas were the favorite sit-outs of the royal ladies, while on full moon nights the terrace was used for private royal gatherings. Even today, one can see beautiful carved sit-outs of sandstone on the terrace. In short, the architecture of the palace is a perfect synthesis of two natural materials, stone and wood.

Halvad has four old step-wells and six Shiva temples encircling the town. The Bhavani Temple and the Bhuteshwar Mahadev at the cremation ground are at least 500 years old and are protected monuments. On the west bank of the Samatsar Lake, a famous pilgrim place of the Dawoodi Bohra community, the dargah of Maula Qazi, is located. 
Halvad is a village of Brahmins. Halvad is famous for gourmet Brahmins and heroic warriors, who fought against past invaders to protect their hometown. Today, one can see several cenotaphs and hero-stones built of sandstone at the edge of town. Paliyas (memorial stones) remind visitors of the bloody battles fought at the gates of Halvad. They evoke memories of women who committed sati to protect their honor and men who died fighting against enemies. Newly weds come here to perform the ritual of the untying of nuptial knots and pay homage to their ancestors. Even today, once a year, an unusual competition of Laddu eating is organised by the Brahmins of Halvad.
Modern day development of Halvad is because of the brahmin community. They brought a lot of changes in local farming methods.
