The Ho Chi Minh City Metro (Vietnamese: Dự án đường sắt đô thị Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, lit. 'Ho Chi Minh City urban railway project') is a planned rapid transit network that will serve Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. 
Its first metro line, Line 1, started construction in 2012 and is scheduled for completion in 2021. As of 2019, most of the network is in the planning stages, with projects for different lines advancing as funds become available.


== History ==


=== Earlier proposals (2001–2012) ===

The network was first proposed in 2001 as part of a comprehensive public transport network plan including Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring provinces, with the aim of avoiding the severe traffic congestion problems that have affected other Asian cities (such as Hanoi).According to the original master plan submitted in February 2001, the metro system would comprise six lines. The plan was originally expected to cost US$1.5 billion over 10 years, as part of a US$3.35 billion program to build a rail network serving Ho Chi Minh City and surrounding provinces.The plan was revised in 2007 and proposed no less than six urban rail lines. The city’s transport development master plan to 2020 envisages developing three monorail or light rail lines with a total length of 37 kilometres (23 mi) and six underground metro routes with a total length of 107 kilometres (66 mi). Bến Thành Market in District 1, already a major hub for bus traffic, will become a major hub connecting several lines.


=== Revised plan and construction (2013–present) ===

The latest plans for Ho Chi Minh City Metro is a revised version of the earlier proposal in 2007 was approved in 8 April 2013.
The network's first line, connecting Bến Thành Market and Suối Tiên Park in District 9, was originally scheduled for completion in 2014. A groundbreaking ceremony for Line 1 was held on 21 February 2008. However, due to funding issues, construction only started in 2012, pushing the project completion date to 2018.In September 2013 an agreement was reached with the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the Spanish Government to provide €850 million to finance the construction of line 5 - with any additional cost funded by the Vietnamese Government.  A revised construction start of 2015 was provided.On 13 September 2017, the authorities announced that Line 1 will be delayed for two years. Cost overrun, audits and delayed payments to contractors contributed to the delay. The targeted completion date is now set at 2020. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily upon launch, increasing to 635,000 by 2030 and 800,000 by 2040. All stations along the route are expected to accommodate the disabled, with automatic ticket vending machines, telephone booths, restrooms, subway doors and information bulletins accessible to the handicapped and visually impaired.
On 28 January 2019, MAUR Director of Project Management Unit, Duong Huu Hoa stated that construction progress of Line 1, as of December 2018 has reached 62%, below the target of 65%. The project has been criticised in the local press for its repeated delays.Construction of  Line 2 was initially scheduled to begin in 2013, with operations beginning in 2018. However, on 13 September 2017, the local authorities have requested to the Prime Minister to push back the construction of the second line to 2020 with completion in 2024. As of February 2020, the expected opening date for the first line is the end of 2021.  No reason was given for the delay. The estimated cost of the line has also ballooned from $1.3 billion to more than $2.1 billion. 


== Lines ==

The plan also includes 3 lines of tramway and monorail:


== Fares and ticketing ==
To encourage high ridership, fares on the Ho Chi Minh City Metro network will be set low, on the order of VND 2,500 (about US$0.11). By comparison, bus fares within the city are generally VND 3,000 (as of 2013, bus fares are at around VND 5,000 to VND 7,000 ). A common farecard, valid on both the metro network and bus network, will be made available as well.
