Cape Palmas is considered to be one of the traditional hometowns of the Americo-Liberians, descendants of freed slaves from the United States who settled in Liberia and declared it an independent country in 1847. John Brown Russwurm, an African-American abolitionist and governor of Monrovia, was buried in Harper after his death.  There is a statue to commemorate his grave site.
One of the town's most famous citizens is President William Tubman (1895-1971), who was born in Harper.
During the 1970s, Harper was terrorized by ritual killings. The crimes have been regarded as "Liberia's most notorious ritual killing case" due to the number of murders, the involvement of high ranking government officials and their subsequent public executions.Before the First Liberian Civil War, Harper was an important administrative centre.
Tubman University, one of only two public universities in Liberia, is located in Harper. 
Harper is also home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cape Palmas, one of three dioceses of the Catholic Church in Liberia.
