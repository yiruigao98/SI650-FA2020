Hazel Park is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan.  As a part of Metro Detroit, the city shares its southern border with the city of Detroit.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,422.Hazel Park was incorporated as a city in 1941 and bills itself as The Friendly City.  From 1949 to 2018, it was the site of the Hazel Park Raceway, considered a high-quality facility originally used for both Thoroughbred and Standardbred racing. From 1985 on, the track ran only harness races. After 1996, it also provided simulcasts of races year round from across North America, with betting allowed on these races at the track facilities. 


== History ==
This area was long occupied by indigenous peoples, with such historic and current tribes as the Potawatomi and others known to European fur traders and colonists from the 17th century. 
In the later 19th century, as westward migration increased from the eastern United States to the Great Lakes territories, this area was settled by European Americans. They first developed it for agriculture. In October 1882, a group of farmers gathered to organize the community's first school. They built a one-room school in 1883 and later expanded it to two rooms. In 1884, John W. Benjamine petitioned the state of Michigan to form a school district from Royal Oak Township. Benjamine, who was School Inspector for Royal Oak Township, named it Hazel Park School District 8, after the abundant hazelnut bushes in the area.
In 1920, the Thomas W. Lacey School, was built on present-day Woodruff Avenue. The first Hazel Park school had been sold to Frank Neusius, who used it as a barber shop and neighborhood grocery. 
Given a rapid increase in this period of the number of school-age children as population grew, the school district soon added four grade schools. It built a larger building at the central location, also called the Lacey School. This became the site for high school students. With further postwar population growth, Hazel Park High School was built. The former high school at John R and Nine Mile r Roads was used as Lacey Junior High School.Hazel Park's growth was stimulated by the expansion of jobs at the Ford Motor Company, based in nearby Highland Park. Hospitals, offices and shops were developed in the area of 9 Mile Road. The electric Stephenson Line was a convenient way for commuters to travel by trolley to Highland Park and Detroit. In 1924, Hazel Park installed its first traffic light, was granted a post office, and established a Deputy Sheriff's office. The city was incorporated in 1941.During the 1930s and 1940s, rallies and community events helped the city during the Great Depression and the years of World War II. Large parts of the auto industry were converted to production of defense-related goods, and thousands of people migrated into the area for new jobs. After the city's incorporation, it improved the infrastructure and provided running water to all areas.In 1942, the Elias Brothers, John, Fred and Louis Elias, established a diner in Hazel Park. The Dixie Drive-In was one of the first in the Midwest to offer curbside services. In 1952, the diner was franchised as a Big Boy restaurant. Louis Elias was elected as Mayor of Hazel Park, serving two terms from 1953 to 1961. The Elias brothers continued to open Big Boy restaurants throughout the Metro Detroit area and in 1983 purchased the franchiser.
With the return of thousands of soldiers from World War II, housing demand was very high in the area. It stimulated a boom in construction. Many of the current bungalows in the city were built shortly after the war.
Hazel Park Raceway opened for thoroughbred horse racing in 1949. It was considered a state-of-the-art facility. Harness racing was added in 1953. In 1950 the Detroit Race Course opened in Livonia, Michigan, to the north of Detroit, offering competition with both flat and harness racing. In 1996 the state legislature approved onsite betting at racetracks for simulcast events, and the track was opened year round for patrons to view on racing events from across North America. In 2018 the profitable Hazel Park track was closed after being sold. The new owner wanted to use the large property to develop new warehouse space for an Amazon distribution center.
In 1966 the Interstate 75 (I-75) freeway was fully completed through Hazel Park, as part of the postwar highway construction subsidized by the federal government. It superseded Stephenson Highway, now used as a service drive. Similarly, I-696 was constructed through the neighboring city of Madison Heights in 1979; it joins the two freeways and creating a busy junction with I-75, part of which extends into Hazel Park's north end.


== Architecture ==
Hazel Park is dominated by domestic architecture of the post-World War II era. Many of the city's houses were built in the Cape Cod bungalow style, shortly after World War Two, and have a second story encompassed in the home's roofing.
Michigan bungalows are also common in the city. These houses were originally built during the 1920s and 1930s and can often be found near the downtown area.
Ranch houses became a popular style, and were builtin the northern neighborhoods during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Older ranch houses were often built with aluminum siding, whereas newer ones, such as the ones built in the Courts, were built in brick or stone.
Front split-level and side split-level houses are not common in the city. However, back split houses - split-levels with the second story built into the back - are common in the southern portion of the city near the 8 Mile border. This style of home is often the result of additions built onto one-story bungalows and ranch houses.
Colonial houses are more rare in the city, but are scattered throughout different neighborhoods. These houses are often built in brick and usually resemble urban Tudor houses. Some are built in stone, often more common north of 9 Mile Road. Others are built in the Traditional Tudor style.
New development homes are extremely common in the city. They can be seen on many blocks of Hazel Park, and often range from two-story snout houses to detached single-family brownstones. Many of these houses are built in the Neo-eclectic style.


=== Neighborhoods ===
Residential areas make up the majority of the city and are in most cases located in sub-divisions located off main roads. Hazel Park was originally laid out in a grid from 1900 to 1925. East-west streets ran from Dequindre Road to Hilton Road on the western edge of the city (now the independent city of Ferndale); and north-south streets ran from Nine Mile Road to Woodward Heights Boulevard.
While largely retained, the grid has also been modified through the decades. Dead-end streets became increasingly common in the northeast area of the city after the construction of Karam Park and Longfellow Elementary school, which cut off the streets stemming from Vassar Avenue north of Woodward Heights Boulevard. Other dead-end streets occur at the borders of the properties for Webster Elementary, Ford Elementary, and Saint Justin's Catholic Church.


== Economy ==
The business districts developed along the city's main thoroughfares. Hazel Park's central business district (CBD) developed around the intersection of John R. Road and Nine Mile Road. This CBD contains the city's municipal buildings, two shopping centers, and a high-rise apartment complex. The first Harmony House music store opened in Hazel Park's Central Business District in 1947.
John R. Road serves as the main small business thoroughfare; the majority of the road is zoned for local business use. Small shopping centers, office parks, and sidewalk access stores are characteristic of the John R. corridor through the city. Nine Mile Road has a more suburban assortment of businesses, many of which are restaurants, churches, and slightly larger shopping centers. Eight Mile Road, Dequindre Road, and Ten Mile Road are also well-traveled, industry-related thoroughfares.  


== Government ==

Hazel Park has a Council-Manager form of government. It is governed by an elected City Council consisting of a Mayor and four council members.  The city council appoints a City Manager, who manages the day-to-day operations of the city.  The current mayor of Hazel Park is Michael Webb, who succeeded Jeffrey Keeton. Jan Parisi, the city's first woman mayor, resigned in 2016 due to health-and family-related reasons.Current city council members are Alissa Sullivan, who also serves as Mayor Pro Tem, Andy LeCureaux, Amy Aubry, and Mike McFall.  The current city manager is Edward Klobucher. City government is located on the same block as the public library, police station, and post office, at 9 Mile Road and John R. Road.

Specifically, the decrease has been in forcible rape and robbery crimes; and a slight increase in burglary and arson.Hazel Park has the sixth-highest car theft rate in the state, and the 52nd-highest in the country. Vehicles built before 1992 are common targets, as are expensive vehicles, luxury SUVs, and minivans.
The Hazel Park Police Department has a force of 42 full-time police officers. The department has auxiliary policing and neighborhood watch programs available to citizens ages 21 and over.

There are three elementary schools operating in the city of Hazel Park.
The northern portion of the city is served by Webb Elementary, while the southern portion is served by United Oaks Elementary and Hoover Elementary. Multiple other elementary schools once operated in the city, including Roosevelt, Lee O. Clark, Longfellow, Henry Ford, Webster, and Edison Elementaries. Webster was closed as an elementary school at the end of the 2014 school year, but remains open for the Preschool program. Lee O.
