Hakenfelde (German pronunciation ) is a German locality (Ortsteil) of Berlin in the borough (Bezirk) of Spandau.


== History ==
The name Hakenfelde is derived a dairy-farm built in 1730 on the outskirts of Spandau. Part of the town of Spandau it merged into Berlin in 1920 with the "Greater Berlin Act". Due to its position at the borders of West Berlin within East Germany it was largely crossed, from 1961 to 1989, by the Berlin Wall. In 2003 it became an autonomous Ortsteil, separated (with Falkenhagener Feld and Wilhelmstadt) from the one of Spandau.
