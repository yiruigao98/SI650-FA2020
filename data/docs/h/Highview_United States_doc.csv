Highview is located in between Okolona and Ferncreek. As like Okolona and Ferncreek it began to thrive in the 1950s and 1960s, quickly becoming suburbs and neighborhoods. Highview also co-exists with Springmill and Hollow Creek, which are a part of Highview in itself as a whole. In 1969 there needed to be a high school in the Highview area. As building began the school was originally going to be named Highview High School; it was quickly changed and renamed Marion C. Moore High School after Marion C. Moore, one of the four original counselors in the Jefferson County schools and also a former teacher and principal. The school is in the Highview area and was built to relieve overcrowding at Fern Creek and Southern High School. In Highview there are three major private schools: St. Bernard, a Catholic School; St. Athanasius, a Catholic School; and Whitefield Academy, a Christian school.
