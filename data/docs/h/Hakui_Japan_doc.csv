== History ==
The area around Hakui has been settled since the pre-Jōmon period was part of ancient Noto Province.

The name of "Hakui" is derived from the kanji 羽 (ha), meaning feathers, and 咋 (kui) meaning "to eat". This name comes from an ancient legend which tells of Prince Iwatsuku (the son of Emperor Kōgen) killing a monstrous bird which plagued the area. The Prince's dogs went to the beast's body and pulled away mouthfuls of feathers.During the Sengoku Period the area was contested by the Uesugi clan and Maeda clan.
