=== Location ===
The town is located in the central Dooars region of the district and is surrounded by tea gardens. The town also lies on the way to Phuentsholing, the gateway to Bhutan, and the border is just about 17 km away.
Hasimara is located at 26°45′N 89°21′E / 26.75°N 89.35°E / 26.75; 89.35. It has an average elevation of 109 metres (358 feet). Hasimara lies between two rivers running from North to South, draining from the lower Himalayas in Bhutan. Torsa on the west and Basra on the East, both offer picnic spots; though Basra is not frequented on account of a cremation ground next to the road-rail bridge on the west banks of the river. Both rivers are perennial; they don't flood in the monsoon season but can be quite ferocious when in spate. This small hamlet lies at the cross-roads between Alipurduar, Cooch-Behar, Alipurduar, and Phuentsholing (gateway to Bhutan). Phuentsholing is accessed through Jai Gaon, the border town. Hamilton-Ganj is another small settlement on the railway line to Alipurduar, about 10 km away, across river Basra. The road traverses through some of the most pristine tropical monsoon forests.
