Barmaqam Powa Makkah: Hajo is also a Muslim tourist attraction. Powa Makkah, meaning a quarter of Makkah, also known as Barmaqam, is a place of pilgrimage for the Muslims, situated atop the Garurachala Hills. An Iraqi prince and preacher, Ghiyath ad-Din Awliya, is said to have built a khanqah here in the 12th century. It is held by the Muslims that the preacher had brought a lump of earth from Makkah and enshrined the same at a spot where the khanqah was built at a later period. It is believed that by offering prayer, a faithful gains one-fourth (Powa) spiritual enlightenment of what could be gained at Makkah and so this place is known as Powa-Makkah. A Persian epigraph at the site indicates that the mosque of Powa Makkah was built in 1657 by Lutfullah Shirazi during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan. A pilgrimage to this shrine is believed to be equivalent to a quarter of the piety attained by a Haj pilgrimage to Makkah. The Ahom King, Rudra Singha, continued to pay great attention to this Muslim shrine at Powa Makkah even after the expulsion of the Mughals from Assam in 1682. During the months of March and April, thousands of Hindu and Muslim pilgrims assemble here to celebrate Urs.Madan Kamdev Temple:This temple is located 42 km east from Hajo.
