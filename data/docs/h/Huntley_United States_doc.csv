The village is located along the "Golden Corridor" of Interstate 90/Northwest Tollway. It has direct access to I-90 via a full interchange at Illinois Route 47. Conversion of the interchange from an eastbound interchange to a full interchange was completed in November 2013.
Illinois Route 47 serves as the chief north-south artery in Huntley. Handling over 20,000 vehicles a day, Route 47 was expanded from two to five lanes in 2011. Portions of Route 47 between Kreutzer Road and I-90 are six lanes. Route 47 connects to Woodstock to the north and Pingree Grove and Elburn to the south.
Algonquin Road and Main Street/Huntley-Dundee Road act as the village's primary east-west routes. Algonquin Road is a four-lane divided highway that connects Route 47 to other suburbs to the east like Algonquin and Lake in the Hills. Main Street connects to Marengo and Harmony roads on the west (leading to U.S. Route 20 and towns like Marengo, Hampshire, and Union), while Huntley-Dundee Road connects to the Carpentersville-Dundee area to the east.
Other important streets in the village include Ruth Road, Reed Road, Kreutzer Road, Haligus Road, Del Webb Boulevard, and Church Street. Reed and Kreutzer are local east-west roads, while Haligus, Ruth, and Church are local north-south streets. Del Webb Boulevard is the primary collector road in the Sun City neighborhood.
The village is located along a branch of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad, and thus many of the village's industries are near the railroad for convenient access to Elgin, Rockford, Chicago, and the rest of the continent.
