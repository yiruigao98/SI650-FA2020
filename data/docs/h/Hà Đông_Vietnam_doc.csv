== History ==


=== Vietnam War ===
During the Vietnam War, Đông Hà was the northernmost town in South Vietnam and was the location of a strategically important United States Marine Corps Đông Hà Combat Base, to support Marine positions along the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  The 3rd Marine Division had overall command and control of this operational area.  Large numbers of NVA operated in the DMZ area. 3rd Marine Division intelligence estimated the combat strength of NVA and VC forces in the DMZ area in January 1968 was 40,943 troops. Đông Hà was overrun on March 31, 1972, during the initial assaults of the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive.
Tourists come to Đông Hà nowadays, especially ex-servicemen from the U.S. and Vietnam, who nearly always include a DMZ tour in their programs. The contemporary Vietnamese singer Như Quỳnh was born in Đông Hà in 1970.
