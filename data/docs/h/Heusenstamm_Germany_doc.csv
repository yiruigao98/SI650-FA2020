== History ==
In 1211, Heusenstamm had its first documentary mention in an Eppstein fief book in which Gottfried of Eppstein documented that he held the castle and village of Huselstam in fief from the Empire and that he had further bestowed these holdings upon Eberhard Waro von Hagen-Heusenstamm. The place was later called Husinstam and, beginning in the 15th century, Heussenstain. About the middle of the 12th century, Eberhard Waro von Hagen-Heusenstamm had a moated castle built here. From the Middle Ages until 1819, Heusenstamm and Rembrücken belonged to the Biebermark, an area held in common with several other villages.
After the Lords of Eppstein died out, their position was filled by the new feudal lords, the Counts of Königstein, and later, beginning in 1581, by the Elector of Mainz. In 1545, Sebastian von Heusenstamm was chosen Archbishop-Elector of Mainz. In 1560 Eberhard von Heusenstamm gave leave to introduce Protestantism, but Roman Catholicism was reintroduced in 1607.
After the Lords of Heusenstamm died out in 1616, the castle and the lordship passed to the family's Austrian sideline, who then leased the place to the Frankfurt patrician Stephan von Cronstetten. During the Thirty Years' War, the village and the castle were almost utterly destroyed. In 1661, the lordship over Heusenstamm, to which also belonged the places of Obertshausen and Hausen, was sold to the Mainz Oberamtmann (chief local administrator) Philipp Erwein von Schönborn.
When Emperor Franz I was living at Schloss Heusenstamm in 1764 on the occasion of his son's coronation (Goethe relates the event in his Dichtung und Wahrheit), an ostentatious tower was built in his honour, which stands to this day. In 1806, the Schönborn Amt of Heusenstamm with Obertshausen and Hausen was put under the Princes of Isenburg-Birstein. The Amt of Heusenstamm then passed to the Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1819, when the Biebermark was partitioned, Heusenstamm got its share of the forest. In 1896, the railway line from Offenbach by way of Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach, a branchline of the Rodgaubahn from Offenbach to Dieburg, was opened.
On 26 May 1959, Heusenstamm was granted town rights, thereby sidestepping Offenbach's efforts to absorb the community. Instead, the new town itself expanded by absorbing one of its neighbours, Rembrücken, in 1977 in the course of municipal reform. In 1978, the town bought the estate of Patershausen, the Klosterwald and the Forst Patershausen (both wooded properties) as well as the Forst Heusenstamm (another wooded property) from Rudolf Graf von Schönborn (“Graf” being his noble title, “Count”). The castle the town likewise acquired in 1979 from the Counts of Schönborn, converting it in the year that followed into the Town Hall.


== Demographics ==


=== Population growth ===
In the late 16th century, Heusenstamm had roughly 250 inhabitants. Almost all of them, however, fell victim to the Thirty Years' War and the plague. Since then, the population has been rising almost continuously and only in recent times has a slight decrease been noted.

* This was the year when town rights were granted.


=== Religion ===
There is a Roman Catholic majority among Heusenstamm's population. The parishes of St.Cäcilia and Maria Himmelskron belong, like the Parish of Mariä Opferung in Rembrücken, to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz. The state church Evangelical parish is part of the Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau whose seat is in Darmstadt. Moreover, since 1975 there has been the Free Evangelical parish (FeG), which belongs to the Association of Free Evangelical Parishes.


== Economy ==
Heusenstamm benefits from its proximity to the Frankfurt am Main economic centre and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region, as well as from the very good transport connections.

== Arts and culture ==


=== Regular events ===
Among the yearly events are not only the Kultursommer, which since 1987 has been held around the Hinteres Schlösschen (“Little Schloss in the back”) and the Bannturm (tower) and with its many events draws visitors not only from Heusenstamm, but also the Nikolausmarkt (market), which stretches from the gateway arch through Schlossstraße and the palace garden all the way to the Bannturm, and the Weinfest, which has been held since 1996 at the Bannturm.

=== Nature conservation areas ===
Heusenstamm is also known as the Stadt im Grünen ('Town in the Green'). That reflects on the one hand the above-average proportion of woodland within its municipal area, and on the other hand the presence of two large nature conservation areas, See am Goldberg and Nachtweide von Patershausen. Both are popular outing destinations for citizens, school classes and those who are interested owing to populations of rare animal and plant species. From some raised lookout points, rare bird species in particular may be observed.


=== Churches ===
The Catholic Saint Cecilia's Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Cäcilia) was built in 1739 by well-known Baroque architect Johann Balthasar Neumann by appointment from Countess Maria Theresia von Schönborn, and it was given its ceiling frescoes in 1741 by Christoph Thomas Scheffler. The sculptor Johann Wolfgang von der Auwera created the high altar. The Electoral Mainz court carpenter Franz Anton Herrmann made the pulpit, the choir stalls, the Communion bench, sacristy table and tabernacle table.
The likewise Catholic Parish Church Maria Himmelskron was built in 1956. The Protestant Gustav Adolf Kirche with its onion dome and steep roof was completed in 1923 with Swedish and American support. Owing to the hyperinflation of the day, the project's total cost amounted to 73,004,221,367,662 Marks and 17 Pfennigs.


== Infrastructure ==


=== Transport ===
Heusenstamm lies on the A 3, which is to be reached through the Obertshausen interchange, putting Frankfurt Airport, by way of the Frankfurter Kreuz only a short drive away. Not far away is also the A 661 with its Neu-Isenburg interchange.

The building work around the railway station (bus station, inn at the old station, railway station square) was completed in 2006. The S-Bahn runs to Offenbach's and Frankfurt's city centres and the Frankfurt Main Railway Station. On weekdays trains are half-hourly (quarter-hourly during rush-hours), and have since late 2006 been run with modern DBAG Class 423 rolling stock.
