The largest cities of South Korea have an autonomous status equivalent to that of provinces. Seoul, the largest city and capital, is classified as a teukbyeolsi (Special City), while the next six-largest cities are classified as gwangyeoksi (Metropolitan Cities; see: List of special cities of South Korea). Smaller cities are classified as si ("cities") and are under provincial jurisdiction, at the same level as counties.


== City status ==
South Korean laws requires the population of a county to be generally be 150,000 or greater or the passage of a special legislative bill by the National Assembly such as Gyeryong to be designated a city.


== Classifications for large municipal cities ==
The national government can designate cities of at least 500,000 inhabitants as special status cities. This status expands the scope of administrative authority delegated from the provincial government to the city government. It can also be reclassified as a Metropolitan city if it has at least 1,000,000 inhabitants. Only Suwon and Changwon meet these requirements but neither city has been nominated.


=== Specific city ===
A specific city is a municipal city that has a population greater than 500,000 and has been designated as such by an order of the national government under Article 175 of the Local Autonomy Law. Specific cities are given powers to subdivide themselves into non-autonomous districts (일반구; 一般區) but, not all specific cities are subdivided into non-autonomous districts such as Bucheon, Gimhae, Hwaseong, or Namyangju. Currently, South Korea has a total of 15 Specific cities.

NotesThe name "Seoul" does not originate from hanja. The official Chinese translation is written as 首爾/首尔, which is a transcription based on the pronunciation of "Seoul", but 漢城/汉城 remains frequently used. As a suffix, the character gyeong (京) is used, which means "capital".
Seoul was designated a "Special Independent City" (Teukbyeol-jayusi; 특별자유시; 特別自由市) separate from Gyeonggi Province on August 16, 1946; it became a "Special City" on August 15, 1949.
