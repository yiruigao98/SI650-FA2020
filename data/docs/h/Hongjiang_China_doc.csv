The former Hongjiang City was merged with Qianyang County (黔阳县; 黔陽縣) to form the present Hongjiang City in 1997. However, the local residents of the former Hongjiang City strongly resisted this merger. The antagonism and uncertainties were being played out for the first time between the residents and local authorities, and it lasted for some time. The authorities forced to give tacit consent to the status, the former Hongjiang was separated from the new Hongjiang City. As a part of Hongjiang City, the former Hongjiang was reformed as a special management area named Hongjiang District, the Hongjiang District is directly administrated by the government of Huaihua City.
