Hot springs (also known as thermal springs, geothermal springs, and hydrothermal springs) exist in many states throughout the United States. The Western states in particular are known for their thermal springs: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming; but there are interesting hot springs in other states throughout the country. 
Many are primitive natural rock pools that one has to hike to, while others are developed. The purpose of this list is to focus on the thermal springs themselves: their history, geography, geology and water profile. This list primarily focuses on the more undeveloped and/or historical hot springs. 
Please do not add promotional links to commercial establishments such as resort hotels, spas, bathhouses, bed-and-breakfasts, "hosting" establishments such as new age retreats, "wellness" centers or geothermal energy companies.
A helpful guide to 1664 hot springs can be found on the NOAA Thermal Springs List for the United States. The same list with added notes and links can be found on the USA Hotsprings Database.
