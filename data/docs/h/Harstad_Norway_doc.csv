== History ==
On 1 January 1904, the village of Harstad was granted town privileges as a ladested.  On the same date, the new town was separated from the municipality of Trondenes to become a municipality of its own.  Initially, the town of Harstad had 1,246 residents.  The town of Harstad existed as its own municipality between 1 January 1904 until 31 December 1963.
During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Harstad (population: 3,808) was merged with Trondenes municipality (population: 6,567) to the north and Sandtorg municipality (population: 7,512) to the south, forming a new, much larger Harstad Municipality.
