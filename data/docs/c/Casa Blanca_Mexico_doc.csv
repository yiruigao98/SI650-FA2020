Lake Casa Blanca is a reservoir on the Chacon Creek, 5 miles (8 km) northeast of downtown Laredo, Texas, United States.  The reservoir was formed in 1951 by the construction of a dam to provide recreational opportunities for the residents of Webb County. The current dam is the second built across the creek - a previous dam built in 1946 failed the following year during the initial attempted impounding of a reservoir.  There are residential properties along the lake as well as a Texas state park. 525 acres surrounding the lake is a park that was operated jointly by the City of Laredo and Webb County before it was leased by the state in 1990 and opened in March 1991 as the Lake Casa Blanca International State Park. Lake Casa Blanca is fed by the Chacon Creek and San Ygnacio Creek.
