There are 15 districts within the province (included 1 provincial capital city and 1 district-level town). 


== Geography ==
Long An is situated in an advantageous position in the Southern Key Economic Region of Vietnam. It serves as a bridge between Ho Chi Minh City in the north and 12 provinces in the Mekong Delta in the south. The province also has Cambodia to its west and the East Sea (South China Sea) to its east.
Long An is a low-lying coastal region, and therefore some areas of it are subject to flooding during the rainy season, which lasts from the beginning of August until November.
The province has numerous rivers. Two of the main ones are the Vàm Cỏ Đông and Vàm Cỏ Tay, which connect with the Tiền to form a larger river system.  Another important river in the region is the Soài Rạp.

Being a low-lying coastal region, Long An is particularly susceptible to floods resulting from rises in sea level due to climate change. The Climate Change Research Institute at Can Tho University (Trường Đại học Cần Thơ), in studying the possible consequences of climate change, has predicted that 49% of Long An province is expected to be flooded if sea levels rise by one meter.
