== History ==


=== Battle of Collierville ===
Collierville, TN is the second oldest town in Shelby County. The town was named after Jesse R. Collier (an entrepreneur), who bought land and advertised it as "The Town of Collier". The first town was burned to the ground during "Sherman's March to the Sea" in the Civil War. The land was bought again in 1867 and the town was restored in 1870.There were two battles and two small skirmishes of the American Civil War that occurred late in 1863 at Collierville in Shelby County. The first Battle of Collierville occurred on October 11, 1863.  Collierville was one of the garrisons established to protect the Memphis and Charleston Railroad.  For the Confederates, the Union garrison was a source of fresh supplies.  Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers' division of 3000 men attacked the garrison and earthworks defended by 550 men, including Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman.
The Battle of Collierville on November 3 was the second Confederate cavalry raid that attempted to break up the Memphis and Charleston Railroad behind Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's XV Army Corps, then in the process of marching to the relief of Chattanooga. When Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers, leading a cavalry division riding up from Mississippi, learned that only two Union regiments defended Collierville, he decided to attack. Union Col. Edward Hatch possessed more men than Chalmers supposed, stationed at Collierville and at Germantown, 5 miles (8 km) to the west. Scouts warned Hatch of Chalmers's approach from the south, so he ordered Collierville's defenders to be prepared and rode from Germantown with cavalry reinforcements. Chalmers, as he had done only three weeks earlier, attacked from the south. Col. Hatch arrived with help. Surprised by the unexpected appearance of the enemy on his flanks, Chalmers concluded that he was outnumbered, called off the battle, and, to ward off Union pursuit, withdrew back to Mississippi. The Memphis & Charleston Railroad remained open to Tuscumbia, Alabama, for Union troop movements. Estimated casualties were 60 for the Union and 95 for the Confederacy for a total of 155.Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman participated in the battle of October 11, and his monument in Washington, D.C. lists "Colliersville" as one of his battles.  The Union commanders referred to it as "Colliersville" in the official reports.
