Canelones (Spanish pronunciation: [kaneˈlones]) is the capital of the department of Canelones in Uruguay. Its name is derived from a species of cinnamon, which is called "canelón", growing along the banks of the homonymous river. Since 2010, the city is also the seat of the municipality of Canelones.

The city is located on Route 5 about 50 kilometres (31 mi) North of Montevideo and on its intersection with Route 64. It lies on the west bank of the river Arroyo Canelón Chico.

It was founded on 24 April 1783 under the name "Villa Guadalupe". It became capital of one of the nine earlier Departments of the Republic. The railroad arrived here in 1874, while in 1908 National Route 5 from Montevideo was inaugurated. On 23 March 1916, it was renamed to "Canelones" and its status was elevated to "Ciudad" (city) by the Act of Ley Nº 5.400.
