== History ==

Originally a part of Zambales and Pampanga, its first settlers were the Kapampangan and the Aeta. It was founded in the year 1710 by the Augustinian Friars. During the American Colonial period, the Americans built the Camp O'Donell for military installation until when the Japanese used it as a concentration camp during the Bataan Death March as the last stop of the march.
Capas as all other towns in Tarlac province was a part of vast wilderness inhabited by the Abelling tribes known as Aetas. The history of Capas dates back in the late 16th century when immigrants from Pampanga, Zambales, Pangasinan and the Ilocos region flock into the settlements. It is considered the oldest town in Tarlac. Capas became a pueblo (town) in 1710 beginning as a sleepy settlement at a place between Cutcut River in Sitio Pagbatuan and Gudya (present site) founded by Kapitan Mariano Capiendo. Capas' patron saint is San Nicolas de Tolentino. September 9–10 is the Capas Town Fiesta. Tarlac province was founded on May 28, 1874.
In the course of time, the townspeople of Capas were ordered by the Spanish authorities to change their family name of their own choosing on condition such family names begin with letter “C”, the first letter of Capas. Descendants of the early inhabitants still hold to this day such family names as Capiendo, Capuno, Capitulo, Capule, Capunpun, Cayabyab, Castañeda and Catacutan.
In the 1850s, Capas was a part of the western Pampanga Commandancia Militar de Tarlac which includes the town of Bamban, Concepcion, Victoria, O’Donnell, Murcia, Moriones, Florida Blanca, Porac, Mabalacat, and Magalang.
O’Donnell (Patling) was then a bustling pueblo established by the Augustinians Recolletos Mission in the 1800s named in honor of Carlos O’Donnell y Abreu, the Spanish Minister of State who visited the Patling pueblo. O’Donnell was reverted as a barrio of Capas by the Philippine Commission of 1902 including Moriones reverted to Tarlac town and Murcia back to Concepcion. Capas is known in history as the site of the infamous death march concentration camp during World War II.
Of the etymology of Capas, old folks believed it derived its name from a wild vine "Capas-capas" or it originated from a tree called Capas in the Aetas dialect, Bulak in Pampango or Capaz in Ilocano.
The town has built the Capas National Shrine. It was built and is maintained by the Philippine government as a memorial to the Filipino and American soldiers who died in Camp O'Donnell at the end of the Bataan Death March, which totals to almost 70,000 soldiers and back-up civilians.
This is a memorable site, for all Filipino and Americans veterans, that relate to Veterans Day in the Philippines. It was once a concentration camp subsequently serving as the burial grounds for thousands of Filipino and American soldiers who perished during World War II. The site was the ultimate destination point of the Bataan Death March involving Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered in Bataan on April 9, 1942.
Camp O'Donnell was a facility of the United States Air Force in Capas, Tarlac, Philippines. Before the facility was transferred to the Philippine Air Force, it was first a Philippine Constabulary post then a United States Army facility.
Another site, Santo Domingo Death March Marker, which is located in Capas were about 60,000 Filipino soldiers who were camped and eventually unloaded to start the second phase of the Death March.


=== Conversion to cityhood ===
With more than 100,000 populace, an area that is good enough for a city and an income close to ₱250,000,000 becoming a city is not impossible according to Rodriguez. Enshrouding more than 53 percent of this town's land area, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has included the municipality of Capas in the design of their Master Plan that is now in process, according to re-elected Mayor Antonio “TJ” Rodriguez.
Rodriguez bared this during his inaugural speech at the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected and re-elected municipal officials held at the Multi-Purpose Hall here Monday morning.
TJ said BCDA claims control of the more than 19,900 hectares as a military reservation, where three of their barangays—Santa Juliana, Maruglu and Bueno—were included, while barangays Sta Lucia, Aranguren, Lawy, and O’Donnell were partly taken.
Being included in BCDA's master plan to make Capas a ‘Green City’ soon, TJ said that this town will become the most beautiful and progressive city in the country with the assurance of preserving the environment.
However, with the forthcoming development, the controversy about the land where some Capasenos built their houses a long time ago is still a big issue. Rodriguez, however, vowed that he is with his constituents’ side in fighting for their rights over the land where their dwellings are constructed.
He revealed that as early as June 2011, he already wrote a letter to President Benigno Aquino III, requesting the delineation and redistribution of 5,000 hectares of the BCDA area where his constituents resided.
He said he would continue to consult with the stakeholders who will be affected by the BCDA's master plan.
TJ assured Capasenos that with the new set of Sangguniang Bayan members headed by his party mate, Vice Mayor Roseller “Boots” Rodriguez, their vision towards the New Capas or Bayung Capas would be swiftly attained through their full cooperation and coordination with each other.
During the occasion, the mayor enumerated his accomplishments during his first term, announcing the ₱65 million increase of budget from ₱180 million in 2010 to ₱215 million in 2012.
He said his administration is intending to generate more revenues to finance more projects and programs in health, agriculture, housing, infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and other services.
