Cardito (Neapolitan: Card√≠t) is a comune (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Naples in the Italian region Campania, located about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) northeast of Naples.
Cardito borders the following municipalities: Afragola, Caivano, Casoria, Crispano, Frattamaggiore. It was once mainly known for its  strawberry and  asparagus production; now also buffalo mozzarella is produced.
The city was perhaps founded by people from the nearby Atella around 350-300 BC. It is connected by the SS 87 Sannitica national road.
