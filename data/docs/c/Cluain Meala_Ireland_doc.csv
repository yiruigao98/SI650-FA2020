Clonmel (Irish: Cluain Meala, meaning "honey meadow") is the county town and largest settlement of County Tipperary, Ireland. The town is noted in Irish history for its resistance to the Cromwellian army which sacked the towns of Drogheda and Wexford. With the exception of the townland of Suir Island, most of the borough is situated in the civil parish of "St Mary's" which is part of the ancient barony of Iffa and Offa East.


== Population ==
The 2016 Census used a new boundary created by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to define the town of Clonmel and Environs resulting in a population figure of 17,140. This new boundary omitted part of the Clonmel Borough Boundary which the CSO had defined as Legal Town for the 2011 census 11.55 km/sq. All of the 2011 census CSO environ in Co Waterford have been omitted as well as parts of CSO Environ of Clonmel in Co Tipperary. The CSO as part of the 11 May 2017 release of data compared their new 2016 CSO boundary with its population of 17,140 with the 2011 CSO Clonmel Environ boundary which is a larger area and had a resulting greater population of 17,908. The CSO are not comparing the same area and are incorrectly recorded a population decline of 768 (-4.3%).
Clonmel Borough (CSO Legal Town 2011, 11.55 km/sq) had a population of 15,793 in 2011, another 2115 people were in the rural environs of Clonmel comprising Marlfield, Ardgeeha Upper (Cashel Rd), Boherduff (Fethard Rd) in County Tipperary and in County Waterford the area between the Dungarvan Rd and Mountain Rd.


== Etymology ==
The name Clonmel is derived from the anglicisation of the Irish name Cluain Meala meaning honey meadow or honey vale. It is not clearly known when it got this name; many suppose that it came from the fertility of the soil and the richness of the country in which it is situated.


== History ==


=== Town walls ===
Clonmel grew significantly in medieval times, and many remainders of this period can be found in the town. A small section of the town walls remain in place near Old St. Mary's Church . This building is one of the main architectural features of the town. It was originally built in the 14th century or earlier but has been reconstructed or renovated on numerous occasions. The church was fortified early in its history, the town being strategically important, initially for the Earls of Ormonde, and later the Earl of Kildare. Some fortified parts of the church were destroyed or damaged during the Cromwellian occupation. One of the former entry points into the town is now the site of the 'West Gate', a 19th-century reconstruction of an older structure. There were originally three gates in the walled town, North, East and West – with the South being protected by the river Suir and the Comeragh Mountains. The 'West Gate' is now an open arched entrance on to O'Connell street, the main street of the town.


=== Corporation regalia ===
Under a charter granted by James I of England, Clonmel became a Free Borough on 5 July 1608, and the Mayor and officers of the town were granted power to "name, elect and constitute one Swordbearer and three Sergeants-at-Mace". The present sword and two silver maces date only from Cromwellian times. The sword, of Toledo manufacture, was donated by Sir Thomas Stanley in 1656 and displays the Arms and motto of the town. The larger mace is stamped 1663.


=== Cromwellian period ===

Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Clonmel in May 1650. The walls were eventually breached, but Hugh Dubh O'Neill, the commander of the town's garrison, inflicted heavy losses on the New Model Army when they tried to storm the breach. That night, O'Neill, deciding that further resistance was hopeless due to a lack of ammunition, led his soldiers and camp followers out of the town under cover of darkness. The story is told that Cromwell became suspicious of O'Neill's desperate situation when a silver bullet was discharged by the townspeople at his troops outside the walls. The following morning, 18 May 1650, mayor John White was able to surrender the town on good terms as Cromwell was still unaware of the garrison's escape just hours before. Although feeling deceived, he did not put the inhabitants 'to the sword' as occurred elsewhere.


=== 19th century ===
A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Kickham Barracks in 1805.Following the failed attempt at rebellion near Ballingarry in 1848, the captured leaders of the Young Irelanders were brought to Clonmel for trial. The event was followed with great interest internationally and for its duration brought journalists from around the country and Britain to Clonmel Courthouse. Standing in the dock in the image opposite are Thomas Francis Meagher, Terence MacManus and Patrick O'Donoghue. Their co-defendant, William Smith O'Brien was also sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the last occasions such a sentence was handed down in Ireland. When delivering the guilty verdict, the foreman of the Grand Jury, R.M. Southcote Mansergh, great grandfather of the academic Nicholas Mansergh stated:

We earnestly recommend the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the Government, being unanimously of opinion that for many reasons his life should be spared.

The sentences of O'Brien and other members of the Irish Confederation were eventually commuted to transportation for life to Van Diemen's Land. A conspiracy to rescue the prisoners on 8 November led by John O'Leary and Philip Gray was betrayed, and resulted in the arrest at 'The Wilderness' of seventeen armed rebels led by Gray.


=== 20th century ===
Clonmel was the location of the foundation of the Labour Party in 1912 by James Connolly, James Larkin and William O'Brien as the political wing of the Irish Trades Union Congress.


=== 21st century ===
In November 2015 the town was the location of Ireland's first marriage between two men.


== Politics and government ==
Clonmel had a Borough Council until 2014. It was one of five Borough Councils in Ireland. It had 12 elected representatives (councillors). John Hackett was the first Mayor and Pat English was the last Mayor of Clonmel Borough Council.
For local elections in 2014 the District of Cahir-Clonmel elected nine members to Tipperary County Council.


=== National ===
Clonmel belongs to the Tipperary constituency which elects five TDs to Dáil Éireann (the Irish Parliament).
In the 2016 General Election Mattie McGrath (Independent), Michael Lowry (Independent), Alan Kelly (Labour Party), Jackie Cahill (Fianna Fáil) and Séamus Healy (Workers and Unemployed Action) won the five seats.
The 2020 Irish General Election was supposed to  be postponed due to the sudden death of Independent candidate Marese Skehan. This was because it was a requirement under the 1992 Electoral Act Section 62. However, Attorney General Séamus Woulfe advised the Government that the entire general election could be open to a legal challenge if the Tipperary poll did not go ahead. So the election continued on Saturday 8 February along with the rest of the country. It was Michael Lowry (Independent) elected on the first count winning 18.1% of the first preference votes. Mattie McGrath (Independent) and Martin Browne (Sinn Féin) were elected on the 8th count. While Alan Kelly (Labour Party) and Jackie Cahill (Fianna Fáil) made it in on the 9th count. This still gives Clonmel no sitting TD as town mayor Garret Ahern was not elected. 


== Geography ==
The town is built in the valley of the River Suir. It divides the town which is mainly located on the north bank. To the south the town is surround by the Comeragh Mountains and Slievenamon to the northeast. To the north, east and west is some of Irelands richest farmland known as the Golden Vale. The town covers a land area of approximately 11.59 km2.


=== Climate ===


=== Flood defences ===
The River Suir floods the local area after very heavy rainfalls in the up-river catchment area of 2,173 km2. The Office of Public Works (OPW) completed and installed a Flood Forecasting System which has been used since 2007. The flood of 2015 had a flow of 390m3/s, 2004 had a flow of 354m3/s with the flood of 2000 having a flow of 353m3/s. The 2015 flood was the worst since that of 1946, which had seen a flow of 479m3/s. Phase 1 of the Clonmel Flood Defence (planned to cope with a 100-year flood) started in 2007. It was scheduled to be completed by late 2009. Phases two and three were completion by 2012. Property omitted from Phase 1 along the convent road were protected in 2014 and the access to the river for the workmen's boat club was also raised. 
Flooding of October 2014 was less than a 1–5 flood with a flow of 300m3/s. As part of a media exercise by the OPW the barrier were all put up.The flood defence consists of demountable barriers, walls and earth banks. Flooding occurred at the Gashouse Bridge, Coleville Road, Davis Road, the Quays and the Old Bridge area before the flood defences. Clonmel is not tidal as the tide turns above the Miloko chocolate crumb factory in Carrick-on-Suir. Flood waters spill onto the land above Miloko on the County Waterford side of the river.

=== Print ===
Clonmel is home to three newspapers: two broadsheets and one tabloid free sheet.
The Nationalist, founded in 1890, is a Clonmel-based broadsheet newspaper that appears weekly, covering both Clonmel town and South Tipperary. It has a circulation of 14,375. It was formed to represent the views of the nationalist community in Tipperary, which led to the first editor being jailed under the Coercion Act on charges that he had intimidated a cattle dealer for taking a farm from which tenants had been evicted. It is now run by Johnston Press.
Also owned by Johnston Press is South Tipp Today, a free tabloid newspaper with a circulation of 20,500 founded in 1995. It is delivered door-to-door in some areas, and available in local shops across South Tipperary. It is popular, fondly referred to as the 'small paper' by its readers, and covers news, entertainment, local notes and lifestyle.
The Sporting Press is published and printed in Clonmel, it covers news related to the greyhound community in Ireland. It has a circulation of 7,500.The short-lived Premier People was launched in Clonmel in October 2010. It was a weekly (tabloid) freesheet with a focus on news, local notes and sports and was published on Tuesday evenings. It was delivered door-to-door in Clonmel and to all shops in South Tipperary. It was founded by Ann Commins, who co-founded South Tipp Today. Premier People ceased publishing in 2011.The Tipperary Free Press was established in 1826 by the future first catholic Lord Mayor of Clonmel, John Hackett, following a meeting of the Clonmel Corporation.  It was proposed that a Liberal and Independent newspaper should be in circulation in the district and Councillor Hackett, having been a printer and bookbinder in the town for some years, stepped forward to take on the task.   The successful newspaper with a circulation of 45,650 in 1829 was an influential and popular voice in supporting liberal causes, yet it was labelled as radical.  Its primary intention was to be 'The voice of the common people' and played a highly prominent role in the quest for Catholic Emancipation as advocated by Daniel O'Connell.  Hackett was sued for libel on multiple occasions for his caricatures of political rivals.  Printed on O'Connell Street bi-weekly, it circulated counties Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and Limerick.  In its later years it assumed a Catholic-Whig political leaning.  Printing ceased when it was acquired by the Tipperary Independent (1882–1906) in 1883.
