On 20 April 1900, the Dutch merchants Johann Theodor Peek (1845–1907) and Heinrich Anton Adolph Cloppenburg (1844–1922) founded "Peek et Cloppenburg GmbH"  in the city of  Düsseldorf, Germany. Both men had moved from the Netherlands to Germany. A short time after the company was formed they opened their first store in the center of Düsseldorf. James Cloppenburg, son of founder Anton Adolph Cloppenburg, opened the company's second store in 1901 in Berlin.

One son of founder Cloppenburg, James Cloppenburg (1877–1926), entered the business in 1901 and opened the second store in Berlin, Germany. The other (younger) son, Anton Cloppenburg, married the daughter of founder Johann Theodor Peek, Marie Peek (1879–1937) in 1901. Ten years later Anton Cloppenburg founded a separate private partnership of Peek & Cloppenburg in Hamburg in 1911. From this date, the Cloppenburg family was divided into the companies operating under the same name.
