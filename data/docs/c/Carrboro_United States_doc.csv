Carrboro is a town in Orange County in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The population was 19,582 at the 2010 census. The town, which is part of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill combined statistical area, was named after North Carolina industrialist Julian Shakespeare Carr (who never lived in Carrboro).
Located directly west of Chapel Hill, home of the University of North Carolina's flagship campus, Carrboro has a reputation as one of the most progressive communities in the Southeastern United States. It was the first municipality in North Carolina to elect an openly gay mayor, Mike Nelson, in 1995 and the first municipality in the state to grant domestic-partner benefits to same-sex couples. In October 2002, Carrboro was among the first municipalities in the South to adopt resolutions opposing the Iraq War and the USA PATRIOT Act.


== History ==
The history of Carrboro is similar to the history of many mill towns in North Carolina and largely parallels the histories of the State University Railroad and the Alberta Cotton Mill. Located just west of Chapel Hill, Carrboro was originally known as West End. It was settled in 1882 near the terminus "in a vacant field" of the 10.2 miles (16.4 km) State University Railroad spur from University Station in Glenn, North Carolina. (State law required that the railway be at least 1 mile (1.6 km) from the university campus "to guard against possible damage to student morals and habits of study," or as it was more cynically put, "to discourage students from leaving on the weekends and spending their money elsewhere.) Settlement in West End increased after 1898 when Thomas F. Lloyd of Chapel Hill built a steam-powered grist mill near the depot. This would become the Alberta Cotton Mill, and in 1900 the town briefly called itself Lloydville in his honor.Durham businessman Julian Shakespeare Carr bought the mill and other nearby buildings in 1909, adding them to the chain of mills that became Durham Hosiery Mills. In 1911, West End was incorporated and named Venable in honor of chemistry professor and University of North Carolina president Francis Preston Venable, but only two years later was renamed Carrboro, after Carr provided electric power for the community and expanded the mill. In addition to the university and the textile mills, the railroad depot in Carrboro also served the local lumber industry, and in the 1920s and 1930s Carrboro became a major hub in the hardwood cross-tie market.A 1920s building boom in Carrboro sparked by a fire in the downtown business district ended as business at the Durham Hosiery Mills declined towards the end of the decade. The Great Depression also took an economic toll and in 1930 the company closed Mill No. 4, the original Alberta Cotton Mill. Passenger service on the train line ended in 1936. In 1938 Durham Hosiery Mills closed Mill No. 7, across Main Street from Mill No. 4, and ceased operations altogether.

"Robert 'Bob' Drakeford, the town's first and only black mayor, elected in 1977, recalled when Carrboro was a sundown town, where people of color knew not to be out after dark."During World War II, Mill No. 7 became the site of a munitions factory. After the war, Pacific Mills bought both Mills No. 4 and 7 and operated them as Carrboro Woolen Mills. When Pacific Mills closed in the mid-1960s - the final activity at the mill was sorting and shipping BVD underwear - Carrboro was no longer able to depend upon the textile industry to sustain itself. The University of North Carolina and other businesses in the area were growing rapidly and provided work in a wide range of occupations and locations.
The mill remained abandoned for nearly a decade and changed hands several times. In 1975 the owner, with the assent of the Carrboro Board of Aldermen, intended to have it demolished. A community petition and fund-raising effort provided for its restoration as Carr Mill Mall. It has since grown into a bustling hub of activity, hosting many businesses such as Weaver Street Market.In addition to the Alberta Mill Complex, the Carrboro Commercial Historic District, Thomas and Mary Hogan House, and Thomas F. Lloyd Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.


=== The name Carrboro ===
As stated above, Carrboro was named for Julian Carr, a UNC alumnus, trustee, honorary degree recipient, industrialist, and philanthropist. He was also a white supremacist, opposed black suffrage, thoroughly endorsed the "Lost Cause" interpretation of the Civil War, and defended the Ku Klux Klan and lynchings. A 2011 letter to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student newspaper, the Daily Tar Heel, called attention to Carr's remarks at the dedication of the Silent Sam monument on the University of North Carolina campus. The following passage, quoted in the letter, has become locally famous:

One hundred yards from where we stand, less than ninety days perhaps after my return from Appomattox, I horse whipped a negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds because she had maligned and insulted a Southern lady, and then rushed for protection to these University buildings where was stationed a garrison of 100 Federal soldiers. I performed the pleasing duty in the immediate presence of the entire garrison.
As a result of this publication, a petition to change the town's name arose, and former mayor Jim Porto in 2016 asked the Board of Aldermen to rename the town. According to Alderwoman Jacquie Gist, "Changing Carrboro's name is not a realistic option". A name change would require legislative approval, and according to former mayor Mark Chilton, "You change it to something besides Carrboro, you're really asking to be interfered with by the state legislature, and it won't be for the best." In 2019, Carrboro erected  a truth plaque, distancing the town from the values and actions of Julian Carr.
The Carrboro Board of Aldermen passed a resolution in 2017 calling for the removal of Silent Sam.

As these immigrants settled in Carrboro, they brought the food and culture of their native countries to the town. Carrboro is now home to three Latino tiendas (grocery stores). Other businesses, including national grocery chains like Food Lion, adapted to the change in demographics by stocking a wider variety of Central and South American food products.

The Human Rights Center serves the Latinos, day laborers, Burmese and Karen populations. It petitioned the town government to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which it did in 2009.
As with neighboring Chapel Hill, affordable housing has become a pressing local issue.

=== Attractions ===
One of Carrboro's attractions is the Carrboro Farmer's Market, which features local organic produce, locally produced cheeses, baked goods, and handmade crafts. Created in 1977, the Market was one of the first in the area to link farmers directly with their customers. The Market requires that everything sold must be produced within a 50-mile (80 km) radius of Carrboro. In addition to the Carrboro Farmers Market, the town eateries and specialty food shops have also garnered regional and national acclaim for their strong support of locally produced food. Carrboro is a favorite destination of UNC students for its relatively large number and diversity of restaurants. In 2005, Carrboro was named one of the 100 best art towns in America.

Two music venues that host national and regional acts are located in Carrboro. The ArtsCenter has featured nationally known roots music acts, such as David Lindley, Leon Russell, and Dr. John as well as internationally known artists including Richard Thompson and k.d. lang. The ArtsCenter also holds art classes, dance classes, and art exhibitions. A few doors down, the Cat's Cradle, open for more than 40 years, hosts a diverse range of musicians and performers.
The 84-seat Dirty South Institute (DSI) Comedy Theater in Carrboro, opened in 2006, boasted a local company of 50+ active performers and a national network of comedians. It was the home of the DSI Comedy School, which offered classes to the public every month in the art of improv, stand-up and sketch comedy. Amid scandal, DSI Comedy Theater closed on August 28, 2017. The space re-opened a few months later as the PIT Chapel Hill, a branch of the Peoples Improv Theater founded by Ali Reza Farahnakian, a former “Saturday Night Live” writer and UNC alumnus.The Carrboro Historic District, north of downtown, contains  the distinctive architecture of the approximately 150 mill houses built by Lloyd and Carr for the mill workers at the Alberta Cotton Mill and their families.  Many of these homes have since been razed, but numerous others have been restored; a number of these homes, centered on West Poplar and Sykes streets, are occupied by students at the nearby University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and are used as venues for independent live music.


=== Annual cultural events ===
The town is known for the Carrboro Music Festival, a free all-day event which celebrates local music with over 150 acts performing at dozens of locations in the downtown area. The music festival began in 1998 as the Fête de la Musique, and was held on the summer solstice. In 2002, the name of the event was changed to the Carrboro Music Festival and, in order to increase attendance by avoiding the summer heat, moved to the fall. In 2013, the festival expanded to two days. Carrboro is also home to the annual West End Poetry Festival, which draws in a great selection of local poets.In November, Carrboro hosts its annual film festival. The Carrboro Film Festival was started in 2006 by Carrboro Arts Committee members Jackie Helvey and Nic Beery, with support from Board of Aldermen and the Carrboro Recreation and Parks Department. The idea behind the Carrboro Film Festival is to promote local area shorts films that are twenty minutes or less. The first year, there were nearly 100 entires. From those, a day filled with fabulous films was created, and that tradition has continued over the years. In 2013, the festival expanded to two days, accepting submissions from across the entire state of North Carolina and beyond.
