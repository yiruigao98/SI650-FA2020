The precinct is situated in the heart of the city; Carnegie Mellon University - Australia is co-located with the University College London's School of Energy and Resources (Australia), research and policy institutes including the Torrens Resilience Institute and The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, and adjacent to the Flinders University's city facilities.
