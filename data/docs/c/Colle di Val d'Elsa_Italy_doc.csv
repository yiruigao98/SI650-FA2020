== History ==

The area was settled by man from at least the 4th millennium BC, but first mentions of the city  are from the 9th century AD. In 1269 it was the seat of a famous battle during the wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines and in 1479 it was besieged by Neapolitan troops. From the 14th century it was a possession of Florence and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until the unification of Italy in 1860.
In the 20th century it became an important industrial center. During World War II it was bombed by Allied aircraft.
The oldest part of the town is the "colle alta", the higher part, with a well-preserved medieval center. The town  developed along the river from the 11th century onwards, building an artificial canal to power various industrial activities, such as wheat mills and paper factories.
The city is also famous as the birthplace of sculptor and architect Arnolfo di Cambio. The Giottesque painter Cennino Cennini and the poet Isabella Cervoni were also born here.
