Originally, Colonelganj was a small village known as Sakrora.

The British made an encampment at Sakrora and maintained it for 8 years. A few years later, in 1802, another British force under one Colonel Fooks reoccupied the old encampment at Sakrora. When a bazaar sprang up, it was named Colonelganj in his honour.
