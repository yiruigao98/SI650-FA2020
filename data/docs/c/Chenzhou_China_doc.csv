In 1928, according to the biography of Mao Zedong by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Chenzhou, along with neighboring Leiyang was razed by troops under the command of Zhu De, who was following directives which originated in Moscow and passed on by higher officials of the Communist Party of China. The strategy was to leave large numbers of peasants with no option but to join communist uprisings.
Chenzhou was the site of a large investigation when its municipal government and party committee, led by Secretary Li Dalun, was charged on multiple counts of corruption in June 2006.
