== History ==
Chiplun was believed to have the first home of the Konkanasth or Chitpavan Brahmans. According to local folklore, after claiming Konkan region from aggressive sea, people were supplied with sixty ponds and sixty gardens by Parashuram, the sixth incarnation of Hindu god Vishnu.
Parshuram is believed to be the founder and creator of chitpavan brahman community.
Chiplun was initially ruled by the Satavahanas, Shakas, Kshatrapas, Kalachuris and Rashtrakutas. Later it was invaded by the Kadambas & Traikutas followed by the Delhi Sultanate, Marathas and Peshwas majorly.
In the seventeenth century it was a great village, very populous and plentifully stored with all provisions. The nearby Gowalkot was the trade center being the major harbour over Vashishthi River. The Paag area in town was named so because it was mainly used for war horse stables. The central area in Chiplun, called Markandi, is believed to have taken name from the Yadnya performed there by Maharshi Markandeya.
In the recent history, when Shivaji took over Konkan and established his rein, he won the Gowalkot fort in 1660 and renamed it as Govindagad. During the times of Maratha Empire Chiplun was halting place when travelling towards upper ghat regions of Satara. Shivaji came to Gowalkoat fort in Chiplun to take an update of his Arm forces before going for his coronation at Raigad.
Chiplun was taken over later on by means of fort battles including Sambhaji, Tulaji Angre, Chimaji Appa, and Siddi Sat, before taken up by a body of Ramoshis in 1818, but abandoned on the approach of British forces.
During this time Bajirao Peshwa, who for some years (1812-1815) came down the Kumbharli pass to visit his palace at Guhagar near Dabhol, built a rest house for himself which is now used as a Government office.
