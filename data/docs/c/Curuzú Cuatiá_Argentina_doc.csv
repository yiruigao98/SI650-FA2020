== History ==
The name Curuzú Cuatiá is of Guaraní origin and means "Engraved Cross". The early settlers (Spanish conquistadores and Jesuit missionaries from Uruguay) called it Posta de Cruz since the site was a crossroads, marked by a large cross with an inscription.
After the May Revolution that initiated the struggle for independence of Argentina from Spain, the army led by General Manuel Belgrano passed by. Belgrano solved a government conflict in the area by assigning the jurisdiction to the Cabildo of Corrientes. On 16 November 1810 he dictated the official foundation of the city, which (respecting the wishes and beliefs of the population) he named Nuestra Señora de Pilar de Curuzú Cuatiá ("Our Lady of Pilar of Curuzú Cuatiá").
The area saw several important battles during the centralist-federalist struggle, the most remarkable being the Battle of Pago Largo (31 March 1839) against Entre Ríos supporters of Juan Manuel de Rosas.
The town was officially assigned the category of village (villa) on 9 October 1852, and became a city on 25 October 1888.
