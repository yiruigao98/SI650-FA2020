Chichigalpa (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtʃitʃiˈɣalpa]) is a town and municipality in the Chinandega Department of Nicaragua.


== History ==


=== Pre-Columbian ===
It is presumed that Chichigalpa's first inhabitants arrived from the north. While their civilizations were not as advanced as those of the Aztecs and the Incans, they arrived at Chichigalpa due to a forced migration instituted by the Aztecs on weaker tribes. Of Toltec origin, the native people of Chichigalpa were the Niquiranos and Chorotegas.

=== Sugarcane ===
Sugar accounts from about 5% of Nicaragua’s GDP and the municipality of Chichigalpa has vast areas of sugarcane plantations. A large number of the sugar cane workers have been affected with a chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is a growing scientific view that CKD is linked to harsh work conditions, particularly long hours exposed to sun without sufficient shade, rest and water. Dr Catharina Wesseling, an epidemiologist based at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden said that while other factors - such as pesticides, heavy metals and genetics – could also play a part, there was “absolutely no doubt” that CKD was an occupational disease.
