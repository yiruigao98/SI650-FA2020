No application is ever denied on the basis of inability to pay tuition. CBS recruits volunteer teachers from all over the developed world every year to bring a global reality to all the students and operates in partnership with the Hope for Tomorrow foundation (501)(c)(3) in Massachusetts to ensure that the poorer students continue to receive the same opportunities as their more affluent classmates. The school also has a partnership with Crescent School in Canada, in which students from Crescent help on projects and teaching around the school. 143 out of the 210 students enrolled in 2006 are receiving scholarship assistance.
San Jeronimo Bilingual School [2] – a nonprofit bilingual school operated collaboratively by a local association of Hondurans and the US based non-profit "BECA" (www.becaschools.org). BECA's mission is to promote cultural exchange and affordable bilingual education. The organisation's volunteer driven bilingual school model creates an environment in which deserving Central American students learn from dedicated volunteer teachers, and those volunteers learn from the community in which they are immersed.

== Commerce ==
As of 2004, Cofradia is considered part of San Pedro Sula municipality, since San Pedro Sula's development can only grow southwestward; in fact, 5 maquilas have already opened in that sector.
Development may be limited by the fact that the area is not properly legalised, and has lands to which more than one owner can produce a title; as a result it is hard to legally buy and sell property.
The commercial zone is the centre of Cofradia, where most retail buying and selling occurs.


== Events ==
General Esperanzano Gregorio Ferrera surrendered at Cofradia 26 June 1931 after a six-years-long attempted uprising.
Telegraph service in Cofradia began 7 November 1905; the first telegraphist was Don Juan Magnar. Other early telegraphists were Cesar Mejia, who arrived in 1908 from an unknown location and Don Rodolfo Castillo who arrived on 7 March 1911 from Santa Bárbara.
The dam was built in 1936–37 under the supervision of engineer Gonzalo R. Luque. The mayor of San Pedro Sula at this time was Don José Castro López, who presided over the inauguration of the dam 24 December 1937.


== Education ==
The first school was founded in 1900; its first teacher was Don Filadelfo López Morales.
A boys' school was founded in 1900, by teacher Donaldo Sabillon Vásquez.
The girls' school was founded between in 1905 and 1912; its first teacher was Elvia Julia Morales.
Another boys' school was founded in 1930 under the direction of Leandro Rodríguez.
The Miguel Paz Barahona girls school was founded 24 December 1937 at the same time as the inauguration of a municipal water system. The mayor of San Pedro Sula at this time, Don José Castro López, appointed Doña Laura Vda. de Alcocer the director, and in 1920 Don Donaldo was promoted to the position, with a monthly salary of Lps. 90.
At that time, sixth grade was offered only in the more advanced villages, with children in others only going to the fifth grade. The age of matriculation ranged between 7 and 18 years. The teachers were very strict disciplinarians: if a student failed to show up for school, a teacher's assistant would seek the student out and bring him or her back to school, to be punished there by the teacher; and punished again by his or her parents upon arriving back home. The students received 8 hours of lessons daily. Teaching materials for students included a notebook made of sewn office paper, ink made with blue aniline. Pencils were of made candle wax, the satchels were made of cloth or nylon.
