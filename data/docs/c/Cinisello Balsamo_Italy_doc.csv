Cinisello Balsamo (Italian pronunciation: [tʃiniˈzɛllo ˈbalsamo]; Lombard: Cinisell Balsom [tʃiniˌzɛl ˈbɑːlsum]) is a comune (municipality) of about 75,200 inhabitants in the Metropolitan City of Milan in the Italian region of Lombardy, about 10 kilometres (6 mi) northeast of Milan city center.
Cinisello Balsamo borders the following municipalities: Monza, Muggiò, Nova Milanese, Paderno Dugnano, Cusano Milanino, Sesto San Giovanni, Bresso.
The current comune was formed in 1928 by the union of Cinisello and Balsamo, and received the honorary title of city through a presidential decree on 17 October 1972.


== History ==
Until the late 1920s, Cinisello and Balsamo were two separate municipalities. By royal decree, on 13 September 1928 a merger was arranged to form the current common.
As a symbol, the emblem of the city now encompasses those of the two municipalities merged: the emblem of the pastoral and the sword on a red field in fact belongs to Balsamo, the rampant crowned lion on a blue field belongs to Cinisello.


== Name ==
Cinisello (from the Latin cinis, "Ashes", through cinixellum, indicating the fertility of the land from the ashen color, but traditional, though not exactly confirmed - even if you have found Roman remains in the area - is the theory that "Cinisello" comes from "Cinis Aelii", "Ash of Aelius", a Roman gens had here, probably, a branch of the Imperial Age) is the western part of the city.
In another theory (also not exactly confirmed) resulting from studies done in the Historical Archive of Arms would be that both Cini, both Sello, were ancient and noble Houses from Trentino who settled in the area, providing their names to the same, which were decorated with the title of nobility with special merit achieved for works done in favor of the Fatherland. Balsamo (perhaps "the balsam tree", but it might just be the surname of a noble family and elders of the town in the Middle Ages) is the eastern half.
