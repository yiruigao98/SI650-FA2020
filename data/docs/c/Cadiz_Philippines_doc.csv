The city is a major sugarcane-producing area. This is transported to Victorias City for further refining. Another major source of livelihood is the harvest of seafood.

The city was heavily damaged by Typhoon Haiyan, but has had success with restoration efforts to a stage where conditions are comparable to its pre-calamity status.


== History ==
Cadiz City is also known as the City of Whales because in 1960, a number of whales washed to its shores in several different historical events. Cadiz traces its beginnings to the establishment of a traditional settlement in a place known as Cadiz Viejo, near the banks of the Hitalon River. Historical records showed that in 1861, the Spaniards came and named the settlement Cadiz because of its northern location which reminded them of the seaport by the same name in Spain.
Cadiz became a municipality independent from Saravia (now E.B. Magalona) in 1878. Its first appointed Gobernadorcillo was Antonio Cabahug, married to Capitana Francisca Cito. The outbreak of the Spanish–American War saw Cadiz take part in the insurrection. Her sons and daughters, headed by Francisco Abelarde, took up arms against their Spanish masters.
During the short-lived government of the cantonal state of the Federal Republica de Negros, Jose Lopez Vito was elected its president. At the onset of American rule, Cadiz was on its way to prosperity with the operation of two lumber companies in the area. The war years stopped these economic activities and brought much suffering to the people of Cadiz. The resistance movement and the local forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units put up the civil government in the mountains to deal with civilian affairs. In the post-war election of 1952, Joaquin Ledesma was elected mayor.
In July 1967, Cadiz was inaugurated as a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 4894 which was passed by Congress on June 17, 1967. The act was authored by Congressman Armando Gustilo.


=== Super-Typhoon Haiyan ===
In November 2013, the city was heavily damaged by the typhoon. Around 20,000 homes were damaged. In the island of Lakawon, from 250 homes, 10 was left standing. No casualties were reported in and around the city.
