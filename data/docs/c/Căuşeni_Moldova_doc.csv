== History ==
The 17th century Assumption of Our Lady Church is the oldest surviving building in the town. It is set more than 3 feet (0.91 m) below ground level and preserves the only medieval fresco in the Republic of Moldova. Executed by Walachian painters in a late Byzantine-Romanian style, the interiors feature religious scenes and iconography in vibrant reds, gold, and blues.
At one time it was a vibrant Jewish shtetl. In 1897, 45 percent of the population (1,675) was Jewish, most working in agriculture.
