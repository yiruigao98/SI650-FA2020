Chía is a town and municipality in the Cundinamarca department of Colombia, located to the north of Bogotá on the main road to Zipaquira. Its history dates back to the pre-Columbian era.
Due to its proximity to Bogotá, Chía has effectively become a suburb of the capital. It is also home of the Universidad de la Sabana.
Chia is also known for its gastronomy and its variety of restaurants, ones of the best-known restaurants are Andres Carne de Res, El Galapago, El Despacho and The Store of Don Chucho.


== Etymology ==
The place-name Chía, also pronounced like Chie in muysc cubun Chibcha language or Muisca language means Moon, although it also has the meanings of «light», «brightness», «glow» (of a luminous source), Month and «nettle» (plant). However, it is not strictly speaking the same word with several meanings, but of several homonymous words, each of which would be understood depending on the context in which it was pronounced.
In the case of the name of the municipality, the place name "Chía" refers to the Moon as a star and as a goddess of the Muisca mythology, in whose honour there was a temple built in the Pre-Columbian town.


== History ==
Chía was inhabited first by indigenous groups during the Herrera Period and later by the Muisca, as an important settlement in the pre-Columbian era. It was a ceremonial center of worship to the Moon goddess Chía. On March 24, 1537, the Spanish, under the command of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, took possession of the town.
In 1781, during the Revolt of the Comuneros, the march of the insurgents towards Bogotá stopped near Chía in order to cross the Bogotá River, in what is now known as the Bridge of the Commoners  (Spanish: Puente del Común). At that site, the viceroy signed a series of concessions to the rebels. However, once the rebel group had dispersed, the viceroy declared the concessions invalid for having been signed "under pressure". It is widely believed that eventually Bogota will merge with Chia if the city continues to expand (as it happened with Bosa and Soacha).
