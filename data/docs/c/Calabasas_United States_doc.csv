Calabasas () is a city in Los Angeles County, California, in the south-western portion of the San Fernando Valley and in the northwest Santa Monica Mountains. The Leonis Adobe, an adobe structure in Old Town Calabasas, dates from 1844 and is one of the oldest surviving buildings in greater Los Angeles. The city was incorporated in 1991. As of the 2010 census, the city's population was 23,058, up from 20,033 at the 2000 census.


== Naming ==
The name Calabasas is derived from the Spanish calabaza meaning "pumpkin", "squash", or "gourd" (compare: calabash).  Some historians hold the theory that Calabasas is derived from the Chumash word calahoosa which is said to mean "where the wild geese fly." Owing to vast presence of wild squash plants in the area, the squash theory is more prevalent among local residents. At the top of the Calabasas grade, which is east of Las Virgenes Road, legend has it that in 1824, a Basque rancher from Oxnard spilled a wagonload of pumpkins on the road en route to Los Angeles. The following spring, hundreds of pumpkin seeds sprouted alongside the road. The area was named Las Calabasas—the place where the pumpkins fell.In honor of its namesake, the City of Calabasas and the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce hold an annual Pumpkin Festival in October, including carnival games, exhibits, demonstrations, and live entertainment. The festival has evolved from a small-town fair to a significant annual event. Though the current Pumpkin Festival is held at Juan Bautista de Anza Park in Calabasas, the original festival was believed to have taken place where the traveling wagon carrying pumpkins overturned and started the area's first pumpkin patch.
The city's official logo depicts a red-tailed hawk flying over the Santa Monica Mountains.


== History ==
Centuries ago, Chumash Native Americans lived in the area that is now Calabasas. Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to arrive in the area. In 1770, an expedition headed by Gaspar de Portolá crossed through the area on its return southward to Mexico after venturing into Northern California. In 1776, another party of explorers led by Juan Bautista de Anza camped there on its way northward from Mexico.Calabasas was  the name given to a ranchería in the Los Angeles area in 1795. The Leonis Adobe, an adobe structure in Old Town Calabasas, dates from 1844 and is one of the oldest surviving buildings in greater Los Angeles. The city was incorporated in 1991.

Thomas Aquinas College rented the Claretville campus from the Claretians from 1971 to 1978.
