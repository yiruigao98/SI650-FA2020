== Geography ==
Coffs Harbour is a regional city along the Pacific Highway between Newcastle and the Gold Coast.
It has become a major service centre for those living between South West Rocks in the south and Grafton to the north.
Sawtell, 10 km south along Hogbin Drive from the city has become a satellite suburb of Coffs Harbour; it is increasingly referred to as being part of the city instead of its own entity as a town.
The surrounding region is dominated by coastal resorts and apartments with hinterland hills and mountains covered by forests, banana plantations, and other farms. It is the only place in New South Wales where the Great Dividing Range meets the Pacific Ocean.
The greater Coffs Harbour city is broken up into several suburb and precinct areas including:

The city is surrounded by outlying towns which are referred to by locals as suburbs of the Coffs Coast Region:


== History ==

The traditional owners of the Coffs Harbour region are the Gumbaynggirr people, who have occupied this land for thousands of years, forming one of the largest coastal Aboriginal Nations in New South Wales. Their Nation stretches from the Nambucca River in the south to around the Clarence River in the north and to the Great Dividing Range in the west. Their history is a long and fascinating one, which is remembered by the people and imprinted on the very land itself.By the early 1900s, the Coffs Harbour area had become an important timber production centre. Before the opening of the North Coast railway line, the only way to transport large items of heavy but low value, such as timber, was by coastal shipping. This meant sawmillers on the North Coast were dependent on jetties either in rivers or off beaches for exporting their timber. Timber tramways were constructed to connect the timber-getting areas, the sawmills and jetties built into the ocean at Coffs Harbour.


=== Coffs Harbour ===
Coffs Harbour owes its name to John Korff, who named the area Korff's Harbour when he was forced to take shelter from a storm in the area in 1847. The name was accidentally changed by the surveyor for the crown when he reserved land in the area during 1861.
