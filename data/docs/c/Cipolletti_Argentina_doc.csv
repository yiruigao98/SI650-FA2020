Cipolletti (Spanish pronunciation: [sipoˈleti] or [tʃipoˈleti]) is a city in north of the Patagonian province of Río Negro, Argentina. With a population of 75,078 inhabitants at the 2001 census [INDEC], Cipolletti is the second-most populated settlement in the province, after San Carlos de Bariloche. 
The city is located on the north-eastern shore of the Neuquén River, just before it is joined by the Limay River to form the Negro River, a short distance upstream from the city of General Roca. Opposite Cipolletti, across the river, lies Neuquén, capital of the province of the same name, connected to it by road and railway bridges.
Cipolletti was founded as a fort called Confluencia by General Lorenzo Vintter, in 1881. The name was changed later, after César Cipolletti, one of the forerunners of the study of the irrigation system of the Negro River, and heart of the apple and pear cultivation zone of the Alto Valle.
