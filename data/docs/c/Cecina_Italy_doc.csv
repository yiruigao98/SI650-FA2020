== History ==

A settlement was founded here by the Roman consul Albinus Caecina, who was a descendant of an ancient Etruscan family. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the territory suffered a long period of decline, which only came to an end when the Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany began to develop local agriculture.
The modern town was founded in 1852, but a part of the city was destroyed during World War II. From the 1960s onwards, it has developed into a popular tourist resort.
