== History ==
Calbayog's early history has been associated with the introduction and spread of Catholicism in the country. Calbayog started as one of the small settlements on the Island of Samar, an area assigned to the Jesuit missionaries. Jesuit chroniclers, as early as the 17th century, notably Fr. Ignacio Alcina, wrote many accounts about it and its people. Jesuit records and reports referred to the settlement initially as Ibatan and Jibatang (Hibatang). In the annual report of 1739 the name Calbayog appeared for the first time. Fr. de Huerta, a 19th-century Franciscan writer, noted in his work Estado Geografico that in earlier times, Calbayog was called Tiayban for having been founded near a river of the same name. Then it was transferred due to a flood to the shore of the Hibatang River, whose name it took.  Then again the settlers transferred to the place that they permanently occupied and took the name Calbayog.
Hibatang had already been a small settlement at the beginning of the 17th century. It slowly occupied a prominent place among the several small settlements. It became a visita (a large barrio with a chapel, similar to a chapelry in Britain) of Capul under the jurisdiction of the Parish priest of that town. The church of Calbayog was built from a scree formation near Malajog, shortest distance is now the Malabungto bridge. After the expulsion of the Jesuit missionaries from the Philippines in the 18th century, the administration of the parishes in Samar was handed over to the Franciscan friars.
Calbayog as a town and parish during the Spanish period was composed of several villages, the most populated of which are called visitas. Calbayog grew from visita size and became a pueblo (town). It was created a separate parish in 1785. Separated from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the parish priest of Capul, it was later given its own minister, becoming a religious center. Its parish priests cared for the spiritual needs of the people living in what are now Calbayog City, the municipalities of Santa Margarita, Santo Niño and Almagro. By the late 19th century a number of visitas became the poblaciones when new towns were created from Calbayog. They were Caybago (later called Oquendo), Santa Margarita, Weyler (later called Tinambacan) and Santo Niño.
In 1878, Calbayog was hit by a cholera epidemic, killing almost one half of the total population. Fr. Sebastian Cordova was forced to leave to save himself from the disease, bringing Biktoy with him as his sacristan. In Manila, Biktoy was a working student, serving the convent without sacrificing his studies. One year after his graduation, Fr. Cordova recommended Biktoy work for the Spanish Army. He was trained and accepted as a corporal. After a year, he was promoted and commissioned to become the second lieutenant in the infantry battalion of the Spanish Army. His first deployment and jurisdiction as an officer was in the whole Visayan Region.


=== Unraveling of revolutionary society, Katipunan ===
After the exile of Rizal in Dapitan, the Katipunan was born in Binondo, Manila. Andres Bonifacio and his men moved heaven and earth to fight against the Spanish government then led by Gob. Heneral Polavieja. The katipunan expanded its membership from Luzon down to the Visayas Region, thereby increasing the number of Katipuneros in a span of one year. Sensing the secret plan of the Katipunan to overthrow the government, the Spanish authorities raided a Binondo printing press where subversive documents were found and confiscated. One of the documents seized was the list of members of the Katipunan. The name Benedicto Nijaga was one in the list, being the collector of revolutionary funds in the area. Upon learning of the arrests, Governor Polavieja ordered the arrest of all suspected members of the Katipunan. Nijaga was arrested together with twelve other katipuneros while campaigning for revolutionary funds. Shortly after they were jailed and reportedly tortured, a trial ensued, reminiscent of that of Rizal and other Filipino nationalists. The 13 men were convicted and sentenced to death. On January 11, 1897, the thirteen were taken to Bagumbayan field under heavy guard. Just before sunrise, the men were executed.


=== After Spain transferred power to USA ===
Colegio-Seminario de San Vicente de Paul (now Christ the King College and St. Vincent de Paul Seminary) were established in 1905 and La Milagrosa Academy was established in 1910.
On April 10, 1910, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calbayog was created by virtue of the Papal Bull of Pope Pius X, comprising the islands of Samar and Leyte. Calbayog became the episcopal see of the diocese.


==== World War II and later ====
In 1942, the Japanese Army occupied Calbayog city. In 1945 the city was finally liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth troops and the guerrillas who had continued the fight against the Japanese throughout World War II. It was only much later that other dioceses in the region were created.
Republic Act No. 328, otherwise known as the City charter of Calbayog was signed into law on July 15, 1948 by then President Elpidio Quirino. The first set of city officials, incumbent municipal officials of the place, were sworn in on October 16, 1948. The city comprises the territorial jurisdiction of the former Municipalities of Calbayog, Oquendo and Tinambacan.


===== 2008 killing of judge and later =====
In January 2008 Roberto Navidad, a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judge was shot dead in Calbayog City outside a drug store at the corner of Gomez Street and Nijaga Boulevard. As of 2008, the crime was still unsolved. He was the 15th judge to be ambushed in the Philippines since July 20, 1999 (the 14th under the Arroyo government).

=== Sarakiki-Hadang Festival ===
Sarakiki is a local term apparently referring to premeditated or frenzied movements which means to allure, to draw to, to attract or exercise attraction, to entice or to win.  By its pre-colonial denotation, it means to praise, extol or eulogize spirits of gods.  The word does not only ascribe to the ritual or hadang as an activity to gratify the gods, but, likewise, hadang is the offering or the sacrifice.
Sarakiki, as a ritual dance per se, is a dance offering of the Warays to their deity or deities which traces its roots back to pre-colonial religious beliefs.  Calbayognons held that spirits occupied a position of command over the power of nature which may inflict harm or do good in society.  Rituals to please these spirits were held during feasts and other occasions, like planting and harvest season, drought and in times of dreadful epidemics.  The ceremony could last a couple of days.  It involved the entire village who offered (manok) sacrifices to venerate the spirits.  Traditionally, our forefathers made use of patani ug ugis nga manok (black feather and white feather chicken) as the offering in veneration of the spirits.
In the context of cultural development, the term Sarakiki is adapted to describe the significance of the movements used in the famous dance "kuratsa", a courtship dance eminent to all Calbayognons.  Today "kuratsa" is the most popular dance form, consummated in all celebrations, most especially during wedding festivities.  Sarakiki is likewise included in songs, particularly the SADA-SADA, an event of merriment in the evening before a wedding ceremony, which rebounds to one of our most well-liked traditions, the so-called pamalaye or pamamanhikan.  Another confirmation is the thumbs-up style of the Calbayognons, while dancing, which represents the tahud.  During the 1st Grand National StreetDance Competition – Aliwan Fiesta on May 1–3, 2003, participated in by 26 festivals in the country,the Sarakiki-Hadang Festival of Calbayog City won the 3rd prize.  Sarakiki-Hadang Festival is celebrated in Calbayog City every year from September 1 to 8 under the auspices of the City Arts And Culture Office.

This is a less popular but more traditional celebration by the folks from Barangay Matobato around merry dancing at the shoreline, bearing the image of Nuestra Senora de Porta Vaga, more popularly known as "Soleda".  This festival is especially pursued and initiated by the descendants of the early settlers in the community called "Tagalugan", referring to Tagalog speaking migrants from Cavite City during the Spanish era.  The celebration is prominently highlighted by the presence of "kubol" or sea-shanties made up of bamboo and coconut palm leaves.
