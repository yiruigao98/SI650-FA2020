Canning Vale is a  southern suburb of Perth, 16 km (9.9 mi) from the central business district. Its local government areas are the City of Canning (west of Nicholson Road) and the City of Gosnells (east of Nicholson Road).


== History ==
Canning Vale's name derives from the Canning River, located about 3 km to the suburb's northeast. It was locally known as North Jandakot until 1925.Until the late 1970s, Canning Vale was a farming area consisting of mostly market gardens and dairy farms due to its swampy terrain with an unusually high abundance of permanent fresh water. Most of the area which is now residential was zoned rural under the Metropolitan Region Scheme until 1994.
Developers of residential areas have incorporated numerous landscaped lakes into their developments, which serve an important function in draining this swampy area.
Planning for the area incorporated future railways stations at Nicholson and Ranford Roads respectively. These stations will be built as part of the Metronet rail project, with an estimated completion date of 2021.


== Geography ==
Canning Vale is bounded by Warton Road to the southeast, Garden Street and Nicholson Road to the northeast, Roe Highway to the north and northwest, and Clifton and Acourt Roads to the southwest.

The suburb is split into three distinct regions. North of the rail line near Roe Highway is an industrial area that has a number of major warehousing operations including Market City, a wholesale fresh produce market. Also in the area are many distribution facilities such as the IGA distribution centre. Canning Vale's industrial precinct houses major warehouse production sites such as Swan Brewery and ACI Packaging, as well as manufacturing plants for the commercial building and mining maintenance industry, such as Complete Field Maintenance and BGC. South of the line is residential with the normal shopping areas.  The western edge of the suburb, contained within a nature reserve, is the Hakea Prison complex.
