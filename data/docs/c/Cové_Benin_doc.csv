The Gelede Masked Festival of the Yoruba people is prominent in Cové. It is a performance in honor of the dangerous and creative powers of women elders, attempting to ingratiate with Nla, the first female of the Yoruba Universe. It relays the virtues and responsibilities of society, advocating a particular respect for motherhood. The tradition dates back to the 15th century and only men initiated into a ‘secret society’ can perform the dances, but will represent both men and women.
People from many villages around come to witness the festival, including many children, kept under control by the ‘Masters of Ceremonies’ with a whistle and a whip. The Gelede Society actively condemns all kinds of social immorality by subjecting it to public ridicule during the festival. The festival continues all throughout the afternoon and evening.
