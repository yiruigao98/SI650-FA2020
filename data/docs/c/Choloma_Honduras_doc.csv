Choloma is a municipality in the Honduran department of Cortés. It is now the third-largest city in Honduras.

 
Many factories are stationed in Choloma due to its cheap labour which has boosted the municipality's economy. Choloma is just south of Puerto Cortes and north of San Pedro Sula, with transportation to other municipalities provided by private bus companies. Many transnational companies are stationed here for production as well as in various tax-free zones around the country.
