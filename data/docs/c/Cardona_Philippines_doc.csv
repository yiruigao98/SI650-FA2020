Cardona, officially the Municipality of Cardona (Tagalog: Bayan ng Cardona),  is a 3rd class municipality in the province of Rizal, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 49,034 people. Cardona is part of the 2nd Congressional District of Rizal.
Located about 42 Km east of Manila. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's conurbation which reaches Cardona in its easternmost part.
In 1855, Cardona became a town with boundaries set in 1857. Later in June 1901, Cardona formed part of the newly-created Province of Rizal through Act 137 promulgated by the Philippine Commission. In 1903, a suceeding Act annexed the town to the Municipality of Morong.  Eleven years then, the Executive Order 108 issued by Governor General Francis Burton Harrison has established the town as an independent municipality.


== Etymology ==
An oral folklore tells how the name “Cardona” was derived from the Spanish word “caldo” referring to a native rice broth. Supposedly, a stranger walking through the street of the town happened to ask the name of the town from a native, who at that time was enjoying a bowl of hot “caldo”. Thinking that the stranger was inquiring as to what he was eating, the native answered “Sapao! Caldo!”
Another story tells that the town of Cardona in Barcelona Province is believed to be the eponym of the town.  Settlements in the area during the Spanish-era were on the hills and the place surrounded by waters of the Laguna Lake.   Early missionary Franciscan friars have seen its resemblance to the Spanish town which is also located on a hill and is almost surrounded by the waters of the river Cardener.  Parts of the present-day Barangays Calahan, Patunhay, Del Remedio, Iglesia, San Roque, Dalig, and Looc are set on these hills.
