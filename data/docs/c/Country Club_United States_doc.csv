This is a list of soccer clubs in the United States. For clarity, teams based outside the United States that play in USSF-recognized leagues are also listed below, with their home country noted.


== Men's soccer clubs ==
Three professional leagues of soccer teams are sanctioned by the Professional Division of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF or U.S. Soccer). The top-level league is Major League Soccer (MLS), the second level is the  USL Championship, and the third level is USL League One. The USL Championship and USL League One are operated by the United Soccer League (previously "Leagues"), which also operates the semi-professional USL League Two (formerly the Premier Development League).


=== Major League Soccer (MLS) ===

MLS currently has 26 clubs. As early as 2013, the league had expressed a desire to expand to 24 teams by 2020. FC Cincinnati entered the league for the 2019 season as the 24th team, while Nashville SC and Inter Miami CF began play in the 2020 season, as the 25th and 26th teams. Austin FC is scheduled to start play in 2021, Charlotte FC in 2022, and Sacramento Republic FC and St. Louis City SC in 2023.

=== National Women's Soccer League ===

The National Women's Soccer League currently has nine clubs. Former commissioner Jeff Plush announced that the league planned to expand to 14 teams by 2020. At the time, Plush suggested that the league was in varying stages of talks with a dozen different potential expansion groups, including some from MLS organizations. In April 2016, MLS commissioner Don Garber stated that half of MLS teams could be running National Women's Soccer League teams in the near future. In May 2017, FC Barcelona announced that it had approved a plan to launch an expansion team in the league as soon as 2018, but those plans have yet to materialize.
The league's next confirmed expansion will be in 2021, when a new team in Louisville, Kentucky is scheduled to start play as Racing Louisville FC. The following year will see the debut of an as-yet-unnamed team in Los Angeles.
