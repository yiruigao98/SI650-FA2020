Castelfranco Emilia (Western Bolognese: Castèl; Modenese: Castèlfrànc) is a town and comune   in Modena, Emilia-Romagna, north-central Italy.  The town lies about 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Bologna. 
Castelfranco either occupies or lies near the site of the ancient Forum Gallorum, a place on the Via Aemilia between Modena and Bologna, where in 43 BC Octavian and Hirtius defeated Mark Antony. In 1861 it was joined with the former comune of Piumazzo.
This town is home of the tortellini, a typical Italian food. In this region lambrusco wine is also produced. The church of Santa Maria Assunta houses a picture of the Assumption of Mary by Guido Reni. Castelfranco has also a fortress built in 1628–34 by Urban VIII as a northern defensive bastion for the Papal States.
