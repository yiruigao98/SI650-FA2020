== The Carvalho and Carvallo families ==
Carvalho
The Portuguese branch of the lineage is traced back to Bartolomeo Domingues de Carvalho', whose son Fernao Gomez de Carvalho was a military officer under the son of King Dinis of Portugal. One of the sons of Fernao, Gil Fernandes de Carvalho, was made a nobleman in Spain as part of the Order of the Caballeros de Santiago.
The coat of arms of the Carvalho family is described as follows: "Three ostrich feathers on top of the navy blue shield. On the navy blue shield, there is one bright golden eight point star surrounded by eight white crescent moons."
Another important ancestor is Sebastião José de Carvalho e Mello, Marquês de Pombal (1699-1782), a Portuguese statesman, who was the virtual ruler of the country during the reign (1750–77) of Joseph Emanuel.  Sebastião was born in Lisbon on May 13, 1699, and educated at the University of Coimbra.
In 1738, he was appointed Ambassador to London and seven years later was sent to Vienna in a similar capacity. In 1750, Joseph I of Portugal appointed him minister of state and he soon proved his administrative talents. When the devastating 1755 Lisbon earthquake struck, he organized the relief efforts and planned its rebuilding.
He was made Chief Minister in 1756, and from then on his powers were practically absolute. Sebastião abolished slavery in Portugal, reorganized the educational system and published a new code of laws. He effected the reorganization of the army, the introduction of new colonists into the Portuguese settlements, and the establishment of an East India Company and other companies for trade with Brazil. Agriculture, commerce and finances were all improved. The king made him a marquis in 1770. Sebastião's power ended with the death of the king and he retired to Pombal, Paraíba, where he died on May 8, 1782.
Carvallo
The Carvallo name is the Lusitan form of the Galician name Carballo.Its origin is derived from the name of the place where one lived or the property owner was from and the founder of the lineage.
Carvallo was taken directly from "Carballo", which was a place in the province of Lugo in Galicia. Hence, someone from that province was someone from Carballo.  Carballo comes from the Portuguese word carvalho, which means oak. Therefore, this name means the place where the oaks come from.
In Portugal, Carvalho is also the name of a province in the district of Pe acova, within the Carvalho Mountains. In Spain, during the Reconquista, the name Carballo was extended from Galicia to the Iberian Peninsula and to the Canary Islands.
The spelling of the name Carvallo, with a "v", dates its origins back to Viscaya or the Biscay. During most recent findings, several members of this lineage sailed for the New World in the latter 19th century, arriving in countries like Chile, Argentina, Mexico, United States and Venezuela.
The lineage that established itself in Venezuela built roots in Caracas and Valencia. Most of the members of this lineage became businessmen, lawyers, politicians and economists.
On the branch that settled itself in Valencia, six members have been governors of the city and its state over the last 100 years
