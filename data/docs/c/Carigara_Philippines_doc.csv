== History ==

Carigara was originally called Kangara, meaning "that of Gara" or simply "Gara's". Gara was said to have come from Borneo, one of the unnamed companions of the ten datus who landed in Panay and purchased that island from the Ati (or Aeta) chief Marikudo. Later, for phonetic convenience, Kangara became Kalgara and when the Spaniards came, they called the place Carigara; hence its present name.
Carigara is the first town established in Eastern Visayas. Its town fiesta which is celebrated every 16 July, commemorates the day of the first coming of the Spaniards dated July 16, 1569. The fiesta that is celebrated almost the entire month of July was dubbed as the Fiesta of the Holy Cross. In the first quarter of 2018, Puregold Jr. was able to penetrate the town market and became operational to serve Carigaran-ons and the neighboring towns. And the first mall was opened as well, and followed by Goldilocks in the second quarter of 2019.
