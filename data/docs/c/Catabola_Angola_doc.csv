== History ==
Before 1975 the main town was known as "Nova Sintra". On 20 February 1996, the Forças Armadas de Angola (FAA) attacked a UNITA garrison in Lisusu, about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Catabola. It was captured along with towns such as Andulo, Bailundo, Camapuca and Chiguar during the FAA Christmas Offensive of December 1999. Numerous local government officials and sympathizers of the government were killed during the attack.
