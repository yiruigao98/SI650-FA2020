== History ==
During the 1st millennium, the region of the present Cà Mau province was part of the Kingdom of Funan (Vietnamese: Phù Nam), which included Laos, Cambodia, parts of eastern Thailand, and southern Vietnam (Vietnamese: Nam Bộ). This region was later conquered by the kingdom of Chenla (Vietnamese: Chân Lạp) and the Khmer Empire. In 1757, the land belonging to Cà Mau province (Khmer: ទឹកខ្មៅ, "the black land") was ceded by the Khmer king to the Nguyễn lord of Đàng Trong (central Vietnam) with an early settlement of Vietnamese people. During French rule, Cà Mau was only a small town. During the Republic of Vietnam, the area nearby Cà Mau was a stronghold (Vietnamese: Chiến khu cách mạng) for the Việt Cộng, a Hanoi-backed guerrilla group fighting the United States Army and the South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War. After 1975, Cà Mau was made the administrative seat and the governmental center of Minh Hải Province, which included Cà Mau and Bạc Liêu Province. In 1995, Cà Mau province broke off from Minh Hải Province with Cà Mau as its capital. In 1999, the prime minister by a decree recognized Cà Mau as a city (Vietnamese: Thị xã) – Cà Mau city (3rd class urban area as per Vietnamese law). In 2010, the Prime Minister further upgraded Cà Mau to a 2nd class urban area.
