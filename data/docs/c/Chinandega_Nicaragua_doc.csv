== History ==
The city of Chinandega has been nicknamed "the City of Oranges" (Ciudad de las Naranjas) and "the Hot City" (Ciudad Cálida). Its name is of Nahuatl origin; although its exact meaning is disputed, it may come from the words Chinamitl-tacalt, "place surrounded by reeds."Chinandega was a small city during the colonial era, but its location among fertile flatlands and its position as a commercial center led to its eventual rise in importance. The Spanish chronicler Friar Antonio Vázquez Espinoza in his compendium and description of the West Indies described his 1613 visit to Chinandega:
"The town of Chinandega is comprised of many Indians, plentiful corn, and all of the fruits of the earth, and appears to be a piece of paradise."
Officially a settlement (poblado) from 1796, the city was planned by engineer Antonio Rojas. On March 30, 1835, a law was instituted that established a fair on December 8 of every year.
On March 15, 1836, during the government of José Núñez, it received the title of town (villa), and on September 2, 1839, it received the title of city.
In 1842, it was named capital of the short-lived Federal Republic of Central America, and, in 1858, it became the center of a new administrative department.On November 1, 1998, Chinandega was hit by massive flooding caused by Hurricane Mitch. The flooding resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes, as well as damages to infrastructure which had not been repaired as of 2009.


== Churches ==


=== Our Lady Santa Ana Parish ===
In accordance with its colonial past and colonial-era urban planning, the city is centered around a central park with the Romanesque-style Our Lady Santa Ana Colonial Church. It has withstood over a century of violent storms, earthquakes, and wars. The church was severely affected by an earthquake in 1885, and was later rebuilt into its current state. This is not the location of the original building in the seventeenth century, however. According to documents from Bishop Morel of Santa Cruz dated June 1751, "This church owns three naves on the river, with its sacristy and choir close by, two small bells, limestone walls, and tiled floors". Two ancient doors in Antigueño style open on the north and south flanks of the church; these survived the earthquakes, including the 1925 earthquake that damaged the façade and towers.

The feast day of Saint Anne is celebrated on July 26 of every year.
The church has been restored to its former colonial splendor, and awaits the announcement that will make it the seat of a new diocese, with the church itself becoming elevated to the status of cathedral.


=== El Calvario Parish ===
El Calvario ("Calvary") Parish is located in the neighborhood of the same name, and was built in 1874 by Bishop Monsignor Manuel Ulloa y Calvo. The first structure here was of adobe, but on October 11, 1885, this was destroyed by an earthquake and later rebuilt. Its patron is the Holy Name of Jesus, celebrated on the last Sunday of January every year. On May 17, the feast day of Saint Pascal Baylon is also celebrated in the parish. The church was recently restored by the COEN Foundation.


=== Sanctuary of Our Lady of Guadalupe ===
Of recent construction, its origins lie in a structure built in 1855 but destroyed in an earthquake in 1885. It was originally built as an offering to Our Lady of Guadalupe during an outbreak of cholera.  After the outbreak, an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe was first displayed in the church on December 25, 1856, and Pope Pius IX elevated the church to the rank of sanctuary, the first church in Central America to earn this title. It was restored by the COEN Foundation and its principal feast day is celebrated on December 12, with processions during Holy Week being celebrated here as well.


=== Saint Anthony Church (Iglesia San Antonio) ===
This church also suffered from severe damage during the 1885 earthquake, after which it was enlarged. The church was unofficially associated with the city's aristocracy; elaborate weddings between members of the aristocracy were celebrated within its walls. In 1923, with the arrival of the Franciscans at the church, it was completely rebuilt. Its principal feast day falls on June 13 every year. There is also a procession that is held on January 1 of every year.


== Colonial buildings ==
Chinandega has many colonial-era buildings, though not to the extent of the Nicaraguan cities of León and Granada, since many of them were damaged during a 1928 bombardment by the Liberal forces, who had revolted against Conservative Adolfo Díaz. Most of the city was destroyed, and only the churches remained unharmed. The city does not have a code that protects colonial architecture as León and Granada do.


== Culture ==

Chinandega's cultural and historical riches date from before the Spanish conquest, when this region was inhabited by various indigenous tribes, who had perhaps originated from the north, possibly present-day Mexico.  There is a museum in the city, "Enrique Mantica Deshon", which contains 1200 archaeological artifacts of Pre-Columbian origin. There is also a municipal theater called "Rodrigo Callejas" which can seat 400 people.


== Climate ==
This area  typically has a pronounced dry season. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Chinandega has a tropical savanna climate, abbreviated "Aw" on climate maps.


== Sports ==
Chinandega is home to two football clubs who have both played in the country's top tier in recent years: Chinandega FC and VCP Chinandega. They share the Estadio Efraín Tijerino Mazariego in the northwest of town near the airport. Tigres de Chinandega also call the city home as a member of the Nicaragua Professional Baseball League. Several Major League Baseball players have been a member of Los Tigres, including Mark Minicozzi.
