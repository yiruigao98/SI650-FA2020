Cihuatlán is a coastal municipality in the Mexican state of Jalisco. Its main city is also named Cihuatlán. It existed when the Spanish first seized Mexico from the Aztecs and was fittingly allowed to retain its name, which in the Nahuatl language means place of women.


== Etymology ==
The word Cihuatlán is compounded of two words of nahuatl origin, a language spoken in Central Mexico since the seventh century AD and the language of the Aztecs: Zihua, woman, and Tlán place; therefore in Cihuatlán means place of women.


== History ==

The town was founded on the Marabasco River, and at the time of the Spanish conquest its population was about 500 women and only 20 men. The first Spanish expedition to the Jalisco coastal zone was led by Gonzalo de Sandoval and in a message from Hernán Cortés to the King of Spain, dated 1528, it is mentioned that the Province of Cihuatlán was, indeed, a "place of women". It also had valuables such as gold and pearls.
By decree of the President of the Republic of Mexico, on December 16, 1825, the harbour Barra de Navidad was rebuilt in order to accommodate local and foreign trade.
