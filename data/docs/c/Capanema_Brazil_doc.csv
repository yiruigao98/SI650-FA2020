This page contains a list of area codes in Brazil for telephone dialling. The area codes are distributed geographically, citing the main cities in each area.
Local phone numbers in Brazil observe an eight-digit pattern (nnnn-nnnn) for landlines and nine digits (nnnnn-nnnn) for mobile phones. Mobile numbers share the same geographic area codes as landlines, but the first digit differentiates them. Landline numbers start with digits 2 through 5. Initial digits 6 through 9 are reserved for mobile numbers, but as of 2017 all mobile numbers in Brazil start with the digit 9. (There is an exception for some iDEN mobile lines operated by Nextel, which are eight digits long and start with 7.)
Area codes have two digits, and are often notated between parentheses: (aa) nnnn-nnnn. For long-distance calls within Brazil, a zero (0) must be dialed first, then a carrier selection code (for example, 21 for Embratel and 41 for TIM Brasil), then the two-digit area code, then the local number. For example, to call the number 2222-2222 in Fortaleza (area code 85) using Oi (selection code 31) as the chosen carrier, one would dial 0 31 85 2222 2222.
For international calls to Brazil, the international access code used in the calling country must be dialed (for example, 011 from the United States and Canada, 00 from Europe and most other countries, or the actual "+" sign from some mobile networks), then Brazil's country code 55, then the two-digit area code, then the local eight- or nine-digit number. For example, to call the number 3333-3333 in Rio de Janeiro (area code 21) from Europe, one would dial 00 55 21 3333 3333.

== Exceptions ==
In a few exceptional cases, some area codes span state borders to cater for tightly integrated interstate communities:

Two villages straddle the Preto river on the Minas Gerais–Rio de Janeiro state border. So, the village of Maringá (not to be confused with the homonymous large city in the State of Paraná) lies partly in the Rio de Janeiro municipality of Itatiaia and partly in the Minas Gerais municipality of Bocaina de Minas, while the village of Porto das Flores is divided between the municipalities of Rio das Flores (Rio de Janeiro) and Belmiro Braga (Minas Gerais). Both sides of these villages use the Rio de Janeiro area code 24. Outside these villages, their respective Minas Gerais municipalities use the proper regional area code 32.
Two border cities in the State of Paraná are contiguous with larger cities in Santa Catarina and use area codes from the latter state: Rio Negro (contiguous with Mafra) uses area code 47, and Barracão (contiguous with Dionísio Cerqueira) uses area code 49.
Conversely, the border city of Porto União in the State of Santa Catarina is contiguous with the larger Paraná city of União da Vitória and uses the latter state's area code 42.
The cities of Barão de Grajaú and Alto Parnaíba, in the State of Maranhão, are respectively conurbated with Floriano and Santa Filomena, in the State of Piauí, and use the latter state's area code 89 for landlines. Most local mobile phones in Alto Parnaíba, though, use Southern Maranhão area code 99. Also in Maranhão, the city of Timon, which is next to the Piauí capital city of Teresina, formerly used northern Piauí area code 86, but now it uses the Maranhão area code 99.
Area code 61 primarily serves the Federal District (comprising the national capital city, Brasília), but it also serves some surrounding municipalities in the State of  Goiás, such as Formosa, Valparaíso de Goiás and Luziânia. Formerly, area code 61 was even larger and used to include northwestern Minas Gerais (Unaí, Paracatu), now in that state's area code 38.
