== History ==
Cibolo voted to become an independent township on October 9, 1965; the "City Fathers" were Mayor M.O. Grooms, Councilman Carl Biser, Councilman Ted Dykes, Councilman Alwin Lieck, Councilman Fred Niemietz and Councilman D.O. Trotti.Before the first European settlers arrived, the Comanche as well as several other Native American tribes lived in Cibolo. The name Cibolo means "buffalo". The community first established when the Southern Pacific Railroad cut through the area en route to major cities like Houston and San Antonio. Over time, Cibolo developed into the suburb it is today.

In 1867, George Schlather built a store on land purchased by his father Jacob. In 1882, the Schlathers sold the store to Charles Fromme, who renamed it Fromme's Store. The community also became known by this name. In 1877, the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway station serving the area was called Cibolo Valley. In 1883, the US Post Office opened a branch in the town and called it Cibolo. By 1890, the population was 100 people.Beginning in the 21st century, Cibolo has experienced high levels of growth, increasing 733 percent since 2000, when the population was 3,035 people.  Between 2000 and 2010, the population increased 545 percent to 19,580 people.  As Cibolo has grown, its share of the county population has also increased.  In 2000, Cibolo accounted for only 3.4 percent of Guadalupe County's population. However, between 2000 and 2010 Cibolo captured 38.9 percent of the county's growth, and its share of the population increased to 14.9 percent.  Between 2010 and 2013, Cibolo acquired 22.3 percent of the growth in Guadalupe County, and today Cibolo accounts for 17 percent of the county's population.

The proposed Cibolo Parkway as an extension of FM 1103.  The Parkway would create a direct route from I-35 to I-10.


==== Cibolo Parkway (Proposed) ====
In 2006, the City of Cibolo incorporated mobility needs into the Cibolo Future Land Use Map, Future Thoroughfare Plan, and Capital Improvement Plan.In 2007, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) completed a study for a possible FM 1103 extension in Cibolo south to I-10. However, TxDOT determined that right-of-way acquisition issues and funding precluded such an extension for the foreseeable future. The biggest hurdles included crossing floodplains and an overpass over both FM78 and the Union Pacific Railroad.
In 2015, with explosive development in the FM 1103 area continuing, the Cibolo City Council stated they wanted to investigate options to build the extension and it formed a blue-ribbon committee of citizens to study the matter. In 2016, the committee recommended a private-public partnership to develop the road as a tollway.
In 2017, the Cibolo City Council approved an agreement with the Texas Turnpike Corporation (TTC) to move forward with the project. As of early 2018, the TTC is still conducting its feasibility study for the road to see if it is a viable project for them.   
In the agreement, the City of Cibolo would own the road, while TTC would fiancé the design, construction, maintenance and operation of the estimated $125 million and roughly 11 mile roadway. In exchange, TTC would collect tolls from roadway users for 50 years.  At one point TTC projected the toll rate to be $0.20 a mile, with exemption for city owned vehicles.

Actual figures are disputed, however, due to such a huge explosion of population in such a short period of time. This has caused problems in the city, due to such unanticipated growth making developments difficult to keep up with the rapidly increasing population, and a limited amount of land.
