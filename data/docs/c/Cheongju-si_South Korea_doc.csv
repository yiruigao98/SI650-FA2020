Cheongju (Korean pronunciation: [tɕʰʌŋ.dʑu]) is the capital and largest city of North Chungcheong Province in South Korea.


== History ==
Cheongju has been an important provincial town since ancient times.
During Hideyoshi's Invasions of Korea, Cheongju was the site of the Battle of Cheongju, during which the Korean forces re-took the city from the Japanese forces in an important early victory.The government of the province relocated here from Chungju in 1908.
The opening of the Chungbuk-line in 1926 sparked regional development. In 1946, Cheongju and Cheongwon-gun were separated, and in 1949, Cheongju was upgraded to Cheongju City. Afterwards, it went through the separation of administrative dong and their transfer to Cheongwon-gun, with 2 branch offices (East and West) established in July 1989 that were upgraded to Sangdang-gu and Heungdeok-gu in January.

National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art – Cheongju (MMCA Cheongju) which is scheduled to open in December 2018, will be the first museum in Korea to open its conservation center to the general public.
