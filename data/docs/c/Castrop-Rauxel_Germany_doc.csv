First mentioned in 834 as "Villa Castorpe", the city of Castrop was founded in 1902 by merging the municipalities Castrop, Obercastrop and Behringhausen. On April 1, 1926 Castrop-Rauxel was formed when Castrop merged with 10 other municipalities.  During World War II, a plant at Castrop-Rauxel used the Bergius process to produce synthetic (German: Ersatz) oil products.
In 1975, the village of Henrichenburg was annexed and Castrop-Rauxel became part of the Recklinghausen (district).  In 1984 the last of 7 coal mines at Castrop-Rauxel ("Erin") closed.
