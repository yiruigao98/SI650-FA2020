The town's name, Curepipe, is said to be originated from the French curer sa pipe, which translates to "cleaning the pipe". There are several theories by historians as to the naming of the city. Some historians believe that the name was given as travelers and soldiers from the 19th century often traveled from Port Louis and Grand Port (now Mahébourg) to refill their pipes in Curepipe. Other historians believe that the name was given after a late landowner during the 18th century.
