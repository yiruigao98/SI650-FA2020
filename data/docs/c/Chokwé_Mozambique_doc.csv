Chokw√©, and earlier known as Vila Trigo de Morais, is a rural town and capital of Chokwe District in the province of Gaza in Mozambique. It is located about 230 kilometres (140 mi) north of the capital city of Maputo. This agricultural town is noted for its tomatoes.


== Floods of 2010 and 2013 ==
Despite the relative safety, in 2000 the town and its surroundings were particularly hard hit by rising flood waters from the Limpopo River.
In 2013, the city "was devastated by the flooding of the Limpopo River. Most of its 70,000 residents escaped with whatever they could grab." Many evacuated to the Chiaquelane accommodation center.
