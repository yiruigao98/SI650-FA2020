Chonburi (Thai: ชลบุรี, RTGS: Chon Buri, [tɕ͡ʰōn bū.rīː] (listen)) is a province of Thailand (changwat) located in eastern Thailand. Its capital is also named Chonburi. Neighbouring provinces are (clockwise from north) Chachoengsao, Chanthaburi, and Rayong, while the Gulf of Thailand is to the west. Pattaya, a major tourism destination in Thailand, is located in Chonburi, along with Laem Chabang, the country's primary seaport.

The registered population as of 31 December 2018 was 1.535 million.


== Toponymy ==
The word chon originates from the Sanskrit word जल; jala meaning 'water', and the word buri from Sanskrit पुरि; puri meaning 'town' or 'city', hence the name of the province means 'city of water'.


== History ==
Chonburi has been recognized since the Dvaravati Period and during the reigns of the Khmer Empire and the Sukhothai Kingdom. Chonburi was initially only a small agricultural town and fishing community, but during the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1350-1767), Chonburi was classified as a commodore class city. On the Triphum map, it appeared along with more major towns such as Bangsai (บางทราย; now a sub-district of Chonburi), Bangplasoi (บางปลาสร้อย; now a downtown area in Chonburi), Bangphrarua (บางพระเรือ; now a sub-district of Si Racha), and Banglamung (บางละมุง; now a district of Chonburi). Although it was a small town, it enriched the natural resources both on land and at sea. Moreover, those in Chonburi contacted the Chinese sailors, who came to trade with Siam. 


=== Prehistoric ===
Chonburi has been settled since the prehistoric period. An important Neolithic town, Khok Phanom Di (บริเวณที่ลุ่มริมฝั่งแม่น้ำพานทอง; now Phanthong and Phanat Nikhom) located in the Phanthong river lowlands, was found by archaeologists in 1979. Beads, bracelets, patterned pottery and polished stone axes to harvest and hunting were all found. It is supposed that the Chonburi area was the site of prosperous ancient towns such as Phra Rot, Sri Phalo and Phaya Rae.

The animals are dressed outrageously or creatively by owners. Assembled in the courtyard in front of the town hall, the buffaloes partake in racing or physical fitness and fashion contests. The Chonburi Buffalo Race festival started over 100 years ago. Usually, the races will be complemented with booths selling locally-made items, stage performances, games, and beauty contests. The annual Buffalo Race is held around the 11th lunar month, normally in October. It takes seven days and takes place on the field in front of the city and provincial government offices. The highlight of the festival is the buffalo race, which takes place on the last two days. This race is 100 metres (110 yd) long. The prize for the first nose past the finish line is a trophy and some money.Songkran day in Bangsaen (Ko Phra Sai Wan Lai Bangsaen) is a tradition that has been held continuously for over ten years at Bang Saen Beach and Laem Thaen. The event takes place between April 16–17 of each year. The highlight of this event is a contest in which the contestants build a sand Buddha at Bangsaen Beach. In each Buddha sand arch is a decoration. The combination of the sea atmosphere and Thai decorations has helped this become one of the most popular Songkran festivals in Thailand. Other activities also take place, such as meriting alms to monks, bathing Buddha images, pouring water on the elders, traditional sporting events, sea boxing competitions, and oyster sheep competitions. Seafood and local food are often sold, along with other local products as part of One Tambon One Product (OTOP). Well-known artists have also given concerts at the event.
