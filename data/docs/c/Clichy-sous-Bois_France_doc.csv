Clichy-sous-Bois (French pronunciation: ​[kliʃi su bwɑ]) is a commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. The majority of its population is made up of African heritage, making it one of the immigrant majority banlieues (urban suburbs) of Paris. The commune is not served by any motorway, major road, or railway and therefore remains one of the most isolated of Paris's inner suburbs.

The commune has an area of 3.95 km2 (1.53 sq mi) with 1.1 km2 (0.42 sq mi) of woods. The woods are remnants of the Bondy wood (Forêt Départementale de Bondy, Parc de la Fosse Maussoin, Parc de la Mairie).
The commune is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from central Paris.


== History ==
The name of Clichy-sous-Bois comes from Roman Cleppius,  seventh century Clippiacum superius, twelfth century Clichiacum.
Flint tools from the Neolithic have been found here.
Clichy en Aulnois belonged to the lords of Livry in the early Middle Ages.
Subject to the Knights Templar in the 13th century, Clichy subsequently passed into possession of the Knights Hospitaller order. Until the 16th century, it was a hunting resort of the French kings. In the 18th century, it belonged to the Duc d'Orléans. In 1820, the village had about 150 inhabitants.
On 20 May 1869, a part of the territory of Clichy-sous-Bois was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Livry-Gargan and a small part of the territory of Gagny to create the commune of Le Raincy.
In 1870, Clichy was affected by the Franco-Prussian war.
