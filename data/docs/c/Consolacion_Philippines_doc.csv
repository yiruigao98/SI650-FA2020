== History ==
Consolacion was a component barangay first founded in 1871 with a population of 14,248.  Before this, it was only a barrio of the municipality of Mandaue. The barrio, formerly named "Kampiig" named after a kind of crab living in mangroves, which was abundant in the area,  became a separate town in 1871. However, in 1902 and 1903, unable to maintain its status as an independent municipality, it reverted to Mandaue.
In 1920 Consolacion was again made an independent municipality after a petition was accepted by the governor. So grateful were the townspeople to the Cebuano governor that they named their new town after his daughter – Consolacion – and they also chose San Narciso as their patron saint, the namesake of the governor's wife, Narcisa.
A year after the construction of the Casa Real or municipal hall, the people built their first church. Because it was made of wood, nipa, and bamboo, it was totally destroyed by a typhoon in 1888. A second one was also destroyed by a typhoon in 1892. A third one was built just before World War II, on its current site.
The present municipal hall is already the third one. The first was destroyed by the typhoon of 1892. The second one was also destroyed, by the Japanese during World War II. Today, Consolacion is a robust residential urban municipality with a vigorous economy, providing a place to live for people employed in the neighboring cities of Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu and Cebu.

HistoryTo protect farmers and the folks from the sun and the rain, the sarok, a conical hat made from bamboo strips and dried banana leaves, becomes the needed fad for the people of Consolacion especially that the town is an agricultural land. The festival was traditionally celebrated every 14 February to coincide with its charter day celebrations but this now celebrated in October. However, the Sarok Festival evolved into a free interpretation dance, with the musical concept inspired from the Miligoy de Cebu, a published Filipino folk dance originating from the same place.

This dance is usually performed by pairs of dancers during social gatherings like baptism, weddings, and special programs in the poblacion. Dancers hold a pair of bamboo castanets in each hand.
