Castelfranco Veneto (Venetian: Casteło) is a town and comune of Veneto, northern Italy, in the province of Treviso, 30 kilometres (19 miles) by rail from the town of Treviso. It is approximately 40 km (25 mi) inland from Venice.


== History ==
The town originates from a castle built here by the commune of Treviso in the course of its strife against Padua (1195).   In 1246 it was captured by Ezzelino III da Romano, returning to Treviso after his death in 1259. In 1329 it was acquired by Cangrande I della Scala, lord of Verona. Ten years later, together with Treviso, it was handed over to the Republic of Venice, to which it belonged until 1797. Castelfranco then followed the history of Veneto.


== Main sights ==

The older part of the town is square, surrounded by medieval walls and towers constructed by the people of Treviso in 1211 (see Cittadella). The massive castle is noteworthy.

Castelfranco Veneto was the birthplace of the painter Giorgione, and the cathedral (1723) contains one of his finest works, the Madonna with St. Francis and Liberalis (1504), but more commonly called Pala del Giorgione. In the background, the towers of the old town may be seen.  The painting was being restored in Venice, Italy; however, ceremonies were held for the return of 'La Pala' near the end of 2005.
The cathedral itself was designed by Francesco Maria Preti, over an ancient Romanesque church.
Other artpieces include seven fragments of frescoes by Paolo Veronese.


== Transport ==
Castelfranco Veneto railway station, opened in 1877, is a junction of three railway lines, the Trento–Venice railway, the Vicenza–Treviso railway and the Calalzo–Padua railway, respectively.  As such, it is one of the busiest railway junctions in Veneto.
