== History ==
Crépy-en-Valois was founded in the tenth century by the count of Valois and served as the capital of the Valois county and duchy. During the Middle Ages, the city profited from the Champagne fairs, markets for leather, cloth, spices and other goods. Then, the Valois and the town of Crépy-en-Valois were annexed by the monarchy and administration was given to a member of the royal family. During the war against English in fourteenth century, the town was destroyed.
In 1828, Crépy-en-Valois annexed the commune of Bouillant. In 1861, a railway station was built and the town experienced economic growth.
On 1 September 1914, the 13th Infantry Brigade of 5th Division, part of the British Expeditionary Force, fought a rearguard action here against the advancing German Army, during the Retreat from Mons.
The population of the town increased after World War II because Crépy is located near Paris (64 km or 40 mi).
Crépy-en-Valois was deeply affected by the 1982 Beaune coach crash, in which 44 local children died. Every year since the tragedy, the town hall has held a commemoration on the anniversary date.
