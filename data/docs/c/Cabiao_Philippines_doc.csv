The desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in an uprising on 2 September  1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nuñez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. The Spanish Colonial Government ceded the Philippines to the United States on 10 December 1898 via the Treaty of Paris. Once again the Philippines was under colonial rule, this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on 23 January 1899. During the Philippine–American War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo’s Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton.
In 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. From 1907-09, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila.
After almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines. HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People’s Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on 29 March 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao. He was the chief executive of the town in 1945.  Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months. In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog, and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-47.
Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada. It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. Cabiao was governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year. At the height of the Huk uprising, when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, fifty thousand armed men were inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo, only to be captured en masse by General Ismael Lapus. The clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel was initiated to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels.
In 1950, when the first tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the town's public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures. During the first tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit-San Roque Road was made. Santiano was re-elected as mayor after a heavily contested election results. In 1960, Crespo was re-elected as Mayor of Cabiao, and Pedro T. Wycoco was appointed as the Chief of Police. The Gapan- Arayat Road, Cabiao Section were constructed by Golangco Construction and Development Corp. in 1963. In 1979, the town's Public Market was rehabilitated with the help of Angel Concepcion (Member of Parliament) for which main building was constructed contiguously from the previous two small one. Cabiao was governed by Crespo for almost three decades, bringing together the people of Cabiao to live in peace.
