== History ==
The Champlin area was first settled when Father Louis Hennepin, a Franciscan priest from whom Hennepin County gets its name, Michael Accult, and Peter Dulay were captured by Lakota Indians. An Indian trading post was later established in the area. Charles Miles created the first permanent settlement in what came to be named Marshall Township. In 1859, it was split into two towns, Champlin and Dayton.
Champlin's name came from U.S. Navy Commodore Stephen Champlin. He was active in the war against England and Canada in 1812, and in the establishment of the Canadian–United States boundary. He died in 1870 in Buffalo, New York.
On August 30, 1853, Stephen Champlin's daughter, Eliza Ellen Champlin, married John B. Cook, a partner of Minnesota's Alexander Ramsey. Although Cook was never a resident of Champlin, he was involved in real estate transactions there, and in its incorporation. In 1947, part of the former Champlin Township was incorporated to form the village of Champlin, and on January 2, 1971, as the result of a petitioned order from the Minnesota Municipal Commission, Champlin Township and the village of Champlin consolidated to form the city of Champlin.


== Education ==
The Champlin area is served by Anoka-Hennepin School District 11, with four primary schools, Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, Oxbow Creek Elementary, Jackson Middle School and Champlin Park High School. All the schools are clustered in a neighborhood near the intersection of 109th Avenue North and Douglas Avenue North. Oxbow Creek Elementary School is in Brooklyn Park.
Champlin Elementary School was built in 1938 to serve the primary educational needs of Champlin's schoolchildren. It served approximately 350 students in the 1st through 5th grades each year — about 1/3 as many as the newer Oxbow Creek Elementary, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) away. Champlin Elementary School received students directly from the Park View Early Childhood Center (converted to the Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science in 2011). It closed in summer 2010, due to financial cuts in the district, and has been put up for sale by the city. It merged with Riverview Elementary School to make the Champlin–Brooklyn Academy of Math and Environmental Science. Students began attending the new school during the 2010–11 school year.Champlin Park High School is one of the largest high schools in the state, with approximately 2,975 students in 9th through 12th grades. It is in the Northwest Suburban Conference with large athletic and music programs. Champlin Park High receives students directly from Jackson Middle School.
Jackson Middle School was expanded in 2001 to become one of the largest junior high schools in the state of Minnesota. This was accomplished by the building of a completely new campus for Oxbow Creek Elementary about two blocks southwest of the existing campus. Jackson Middle School then expanded into the former Oxbow Creek Elementary building. In 2006, Jackson Middle School built an observatory, which hosts public viewing nights and provides astronomy education to both its and other Anoka–Hennepin students. Jackson Middle School is home to approximately 2,356 students in 6th through 8th grades. It receives students directly from Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, Dayton Elementary School, Oxbow Creek Elementary, and Monroe Elementary.
Oxbow Creek Elementary's new facility opened in 2001. It is an exact match to Andover Elementary School, as the school district used the same blueprints to build the two at the same time. Oxbow Creek Elementary provides educational services to 1,090 students in kindergarten through 5th grades.
Champlin–Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, formerly Park View Kindergarten, provides kindergarten through 5th grade math and environmental science education.
