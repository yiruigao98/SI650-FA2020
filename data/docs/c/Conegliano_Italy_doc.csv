== Industry ==
Conegliano is noted for its wine, chiefly the dry white Prosecco (made from the glera grape) which comes in three varieties: tranquillo (still), frizzante (slightly sparkling) and spumante (sparkling). It is also home to Italy's oldest and most prestigious wine school called Scuola Enologica.
It is also home to the Istituto Sperimentale per la Viticoltura where several Italian grape varieties have been bred, including Albarossa, Vega and Valentino nero. Additionally, viticulturalists at the institute have helped save many native Italian grape varieties from extinction, such as the Valpolicella grape Bigolona.There is also a great industrial tradition, especially specialized in home appliances.
