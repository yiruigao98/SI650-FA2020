Chŏngju (Korean pronunciation: [tsʌŋ.dzu]; also Jŏngju) is a si, or city, in southern North P'yŏngan province, North Korea.  Prior to 1994, it was designated as a kun or county. The terrain is mostly level, but mountainous in the north. To the south lies the Chŏngju Plain, where the hills do not rise above 200 metres (660 ft). Chŏngju also includes approximately 10 islands in the Yellow Sea.

Some 40 percent of Chŏngju is covered by coniferous forestland.

Chŏngju is divided into 14 tong (neighbourhoods) and 18 ri (villages):

Local agriculture is dominated by orcharding and rice farming; the chestnuts of this region are especially famous.
