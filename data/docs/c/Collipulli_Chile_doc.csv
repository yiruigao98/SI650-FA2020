== History ==
On 22 November 1867, the city was founded as a military fort during the Occupation of Araucanía. No traces of the fort remain today. The fort was protected by defensive ditches and wooden stakes, and was supported by a series of bridges placed over the Malleco River and its tributaries. Other forts were established in the area, and settlers soon followed, developing the land for agriculture.

The Malleco Viaduct, today a National Monument, was officially opened on 26 October 1890, by President Manuel Balmaceda. The viaduct served as a rapid and effective transportation system for trade and commerce. It sustained some damage in the major earthquake of 27 February 2010.


=== Present day ===
Collipulli's economy relies on farming, forestry, and services. Although the majority of the land is suitable for agriculture, an increasing area has been given to forestry in recent years. Mario Garbarini helped to found the firefighters company and was well known in Collipulli.
