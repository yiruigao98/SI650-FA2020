The city of Chipata is the administrative centre of the Eastern Province of Zambia and Chipata District. It was declared the 5th city of the country, after Lusaka, Ndola, Kitwe and Livingstone, by President Edgar Lungu on 24 February 2017. The city has undergone rapid economic and infrastructure growth in the years, leading up to city status.


== Location ==
Chipata is located approximately 570 kilometres (354 mi), east of Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. This is about 150 kilometres (93 mi) west of Lilongwe, the capital city of Malawi. The geographical coordinates of Chipata are 13째38'43.0"S, 32째38'47.0"E (Latitude:13째38'43.0"S; Longitude:32째38'47.0"E). The average elevation of Chipata is 1,181 metres (3,875 ft), above sea level.


== Overview ==
Having a modern market, a central hospital, shopping malls, a university, some colleges and a number of schools, Chipata is the business and administrative hub of the region. The town boasts a four star hotel, a golf course, an airport, and a "welcome arch". Developed areas includes Kalongwezi, Moth, and Little Bombay.
Chipata is the regional head of the Ngoni of Zambia. The Ngoni adopted the languages of the tribes they conquered, so Chewa and Nsenga are the principal languages, although Tumbuka and English are widely spoken, plus some Indian languages, as a large number of Zambian Indians live in the town. It is located near the border with Malawi, and lies on the Great East Road which connects the capitals Lilongwe 150 kilometres (93 mi) to the east, and Lusaka 570 kilometres (354 mi) to the west. It is a popular access point for the South Luangwa National Park.


== History ==
Chipata's name comes from the Chewa word "Chimpata" meaning "large space," in reference to the town's situation in a shallow valley between hills. The name of the central neighbourhood of Kapata, the original centre of town, comes from the Chewa word meaning "small space."
Chipata was formerly known as Fort Jameson (and informally as "Fort Jimmy"), being named after Leander Starr Jameson, the 19th-century British  politician and adventurer. Even during the colonial period, few agreed that Jameson, who is mainly known for his part in the infamous Jameson Raid, fully deserved the honour of having any town named after him. Like 'Fort Manning' and 'Fort Rosebery', Fort Jameson was called a "fort" because the local government offices, the "boma", were once fortified.
Fort Jameson was the capital of the British protectorate of North-Eastern Rhodesia between 1900 and 1911.

== Transport ==

An extension of the Sena railway, connecting the city of Chipata to the territory of Malawi (via Mchinji) was opened in August 2011. Chipata will now act as the Zambian railhead and entry point from Malawi and beyond. In the pipeline since 1982, the short link, about 35 kilometres (22 mi), provides a through-route for rail traffic from Zambia via Malawi to the Indian Ocean deep-water port at Nacala in Mozambique. The route and alignment of the line has been laid out, including the site of Chipata station and the basic station building.The route will provide an alternative to two existing rail routes to the Indian Ocean, at Dar es Salaam and Beira. In 2015 it was proposed to build a rail link to Serenje, a small town on the TAZARA Railway line.


== Rivers ==
Chipata has four major streams pouring into the Luangwa river. The Luangwa river rises in the Lilonda and Mafinga Hills in north-east Zambia at an elevation of around 1500 meters near the border with Tanzania and Malawi, and flows in a southwesterly direction through a broad valley. The water from the streams and the Luangwa river is used for farming by the inhabitants around the district.


== Soil and Vegetation ==
There are three main soil types namely Acrisols, Fersiallitic soils, and Lithosols. There are four vegetation types, the main one being the Brachystegia (Miombo) woodland and Munga vegetation types.
