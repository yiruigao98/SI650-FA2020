Coslada (Spanish pronunciation: [kozˈlaða]) is a city and municipality in the autonomous community of Madrid in central Spain.
The Dry Port of the Community of Madrid is located in Coslada, which has become a major logistics hub in the country. Due to the area's close proximity to the Madrid–Barajas Airport and the Dry Port, the stretch of industrial cities from Madrid to Guadalajara along the A-2 freeway (known as the Corredor del Henares and more recently the "golden mile" of online sales) has, since the 1990s, grown into a logistics hub, similar to East Midlands in England, with the entire area now boasting 5.7 million m² of logistics space in total. With investment from foreign funds and socimis, the logistics sector has grown rapidly thanks to increases in internet shopping. As Coslada runs out of space, other logistics companies have started to move into nearby cities such as Marchamalo, San Fernando de Henares, and Torija.A large percentage of Coslada's population works at the airport. Most Spanish transportation and shipping companies have branch offices in Coslada; the city is host to 706 logistics companies, the most in the country. El Corte Inglés operates a distribution center in the city, and delivery company Nacex opened a new distribution center in November 2018.As of 2019, the mayor of Coslada is Ángel Viveros (PSOE).
