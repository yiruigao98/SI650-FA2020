== History ==

The area now known as Cherry Hill was originally settled by the Lenni-Lenape Native Americans before being displaced by the first settlers from England, namely Quaker followers of William Penn who arrived in the late 17th century. The first settlement was a small cluster of homes named Colestown, in the perimeters of what is now the Colestown Cemetery on the corner of Route 41 (King's Highway) and Church Road. The municipality was founded on February 25, 1844, in Gloucester County as Delaware Township from half of the area of Waterford Township, and became part of Camden County at its creation some two weeks later on March 13, 1844. Portions of the township were taken to form Stockton Township (February 23, 1859) and Merchantville (March 3, 1874). At its territorial peak, Delaware Township included all of modern-day Cherry Hill Township, as well as the neighborhood of North Camden and the municipalities of Merchantville and Pennsauken (including Petty's Island in the Delaware River).
The township's population grew rapidly after World War II, and continued to increase until the 1980s. Today, the municipality's population is stable with new development generally occurring in pockets of custom luxury houses or through the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of commercial and industrial areas.


=== Origin of the name ===
Cherry Hill was a 19th-century farm on Kaighn Avenue (Route 38), owned by Abraham Browning. The farm property later became the Cherry Hill Inn (now an AMC Theatres Cherry Hill 24 movie theater complex), as well as an office campus (now a shopping center with big-box retailers), and today's Cherry Hill Towers and Cherry Hill Estates housing developments.Adding to the prevalence of the Cherry Hill name, developer Eugene Mori branded several properties using the name, including the Cherry Hill Inn and Cherry Hill Lodge hotels, Cherry Hill Apartments, and Cherry Hill Estates. Cherry Hill Shopping Center (now known as Cherry Hill Mall) opened in 1961 opposite the old Cherry Hill Farm site, featuring 75 stores within a single enclosed space.When the township sought a new post office, another New Jersey municipality in Hunterdon County was using the name Delaware Township.  The United States Postal Service insisted on a name change, suggesting "Deltown". Delaware Township mayors Christian Weber and John Gilmour pursued public write-in campaigns to select possible titles, and chose Cherry Hill from suggestions that included Chapel Hill, Cherry Valley and Delaware City. The name "Cherry Hill" was chosen by the township's citizens in a non-binding referendum in 1961, and was officially adopted November 7, 1961.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
Created as Delaware Township in 1844, the community was first governed by a Township Committee. On May 19, 1951, the citizens adopted, in a special election, a Walsh Act Commission form of government, consisting of a three-member Board of Commissioners. In 1962, the Township's population passed the 30,000 mark and two additional Commissioners were elected. Following a study made by a Citizen's Advisory Committee, a special election was held in 1962. The township voted to change its form of government to the Council-Manager Plan A under the Faulkner Act. Five Council members were elected at-large in a May election to serve concurrent four-year terms. The Council members elected one of their own as Mayor, and a Township Manager served as the Chief Administrator of the Township.By 1975, after a Charter Study Commission report and the passage of a ballot referendum, the township adopted the Council-Manager Plan B form of government. Two features of the government were changed: council members were to be elected every two years for overlapping terms of four years and the number of Council members would increase from five to seven.After a 1981 referendum, the government changed yet again, this time to a Mayor-Council Plan B form of government. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 565) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of a full-time 'strong' mayor who is elected directly by the people and seven council members who are elected at-large for staggered four-year terms, with either three or four seats up for election in odd-numbered years. After the passage of a ballot referendum in November 1986, voting or the mayor and council was shifted from a non-partisan May election to a partisan November election.As of 2020, the Mayor of Cherry Hill is Democrat Susan Shin Angulo, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Township Council are Council President David Fleisher (D, 2021), Council Vice President Brian Bauerle (D, 2023), Jennifer Apell (D, 2023), Sangeeta Doshi (D, 2021), Michele Golkow (D, 2023), Carolyn Jacobs (D, 2021) and Carole Roskoph (D, 2021).In January 2016, the Township Council selected Carolyn Jacobs from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that became vacant when Susan Shin Angulo took office as a Camden County Freeholder.N. John Amato, whose 30 years of service made him the township's longest-serving council member, died in office in September 2014. At a special council meeting in October 2014, Brian Bauerle was selected to fill Amato's seat, which expired in December 2015.
