The name "Kurigram" is derived from two words "Kuri" and "Gram". "Gram" means village. The word "Kuri" is non-aryan language. It is a counting terminology which means twenty.

The counting system as Kuri has come from this Arab-Austric language.


== History ==
Civilization of this area was built by the combination of the Nigro-Austric and Dravid-Mongolian people which is unanimously recognised as the old Aryan civilization. Sometimes this area was included in Gaurabardhan, sometimes in Pragjotishpur. Gaurabardhan is today's Mahasthangarh, Pragjotishpur is the old name of Kamrup which is today's Assam. This two kingdom was inhabited by non-aryans. No Aryan was able to enter this area due to the defence of non-aryans. As a result, there is no sign of Aryan civilization here. The Kamrup kingdom was divided into many small kingdoms creating Cooch Behar, Uari, Ahom, Kooki, Tripura and Arakan kingdom. The northern side of this town (Nageshwari. Phulbari, Lalmonirhat and Bhurungamari) was included in Cooch Behar and the southern part (Ulipur, Chilmari and Raomari) was in Uari kingdom.
In the beginning of twelfth century, Khen dynasty was emerged in this area. Nildhwaj, Chakradhwaj and Nilambor were the kings of this dynasty. The capital of their kingdom was in Chatra which is situated in today's Bidyananda union of Ulipur upazila. In 1418, Sultan of Gouro, Hosen Shah attacked Nilambar. Nilambar was lost in the battle and then the area was controlled by the Muslims which was later controlled by the Mughal Empire.
During the British regime, broker of East India Company, Debi Singh and Hare Ram came to the area as dewan (controller). The torture and mistreatment of the East India Company caused the Great Bengal famine of 1770.  As a result, many rebellion were created which were led by Majnu Shah, Nuruddin Karek Jong, Bhabani Pathak, Debi Choudhurani, Musa Shah, Cherag Ali Shah and many more. In the regime of East India Company, Kurigram was divided into four divisions which were Borobari, Ulipur, Chimari and Nageshwari. At that time "Kuriganj" was a place of Borobari division, Balabari was the central point of Kuriganj. The British government first established Kurigram mahakuma in 22 April 1875. Sir william Hunter described Kurigram as "Kuriganj" in his "Gazetteer of Rangpur District". The Kurigram mahakuma was consisted of 8 thanas named Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Ulipur, Chilmari, Roumari, Nageshwar, Bhurungamari and Phulbari. It was established as a district on 1 February 1984 consisting of 9 current upazilas.
