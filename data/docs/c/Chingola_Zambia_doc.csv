Chingola is a city in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the country's copper-mining region, with a population of 216,626 (2010 census). It is the home of Nchanga Copper Mine, a deep-shaft high-grade content copper mining operation, which subsequently  (in the 1960s) led to the development of two open pit operations, Chingola Open Pit and then Nchanga Open Pit (the latter being the second largest open cast mine in the world).


== History ==
Chingola was founded in 1943, somewhat later than most other Copperbelt towns. Chingola was built to service the newly-opened Nchanga copper mine. Alongside Luanshya (the "Garden Town of the Copperbelt"), Chingola is perhaps one of the best laid-out and most picturesque towns in Zambia.


== Mines ==
Situated at the north-west end of the Copperbelt Province, the Nchanga Mines Open Pit workings lie in an arc 11 km long around the west and north of the town, covering nearly 30 kmÂ². The deepest part of the pit is 400 m lower than the surrounding plateau.


== Communications ==
A freight-only branch of Zambian Railways services the town from Kitwe. The branch includes the movement of copper ore to the smelters at Nkana in Kitwe.
In 2013, a direct link to the Benguela Railway in Angola was proposed.
In Chingola, the main road to Lubumbashi in DR Congo via Chililabombwe and Konkola branches off the main Copperbelt highway running south-east from Kitwe going north-west to Solwezi.
Chingola is served by Kasompe Airport, IATA code CGJ.
Chingola is rated 5th on the most developed cities in Zambia.
The most developed areas are Nchanga South & River Side. Chingola is known to be one of the best internet service provided cities in Zambia. It is also served by 2 shopping malls: The Park Mall and the Motherland Shopping Mall.


== Public facilities ==
The town has two hospitals: Nchanga North General Hospital (Government-owned, bed capacity 283) and Nchanga South Hospital (privately owned by the KCM (Konkola Copper Mines Plc), bed capacity about 100). The town also has sports amenities that were previously managed and maintained by the subsidiary of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited, Nchanga Division; These include Crickets Club, Swimming pool (non functional), Rugby Club, Golf Club, tennis and Cinema (now converted into a church). These clubs are all located along Fern Avenue, aside from the golf course. There are several lodges in Chingola and one notable Hotel, Protea by Marriott Chingola located along Kabundi road. Nchanga Rangers Football club is the towns largest soccer club and officiates games at the towns largest soccer stadium located near Nchanga North suburbs.
During the 60's, 70's and 80's, Chingola was hailed as the cleanest and well maintained town in Chingola. This was due, in part, to the mining company's policy to manage and maintain social services in the town, particularly in residential areas where employees of the mining company resided. The mining conglomerate ZCCM Limited and its subsidiaries, such as Nchanga Division, also had a strong CSR agenda that extended to residential areas and communities not directly linked to the mines.
