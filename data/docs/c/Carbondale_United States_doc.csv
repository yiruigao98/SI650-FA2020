Carbondale is a city in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, United States. Carbondale is located approximately 15 miles due northeast of the city of Scranton in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The population was 8,891 at the 2010 census.
The land area that became Carbondale was developed by William and Maurice Wurts, the founders of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, during the rise of the anthracite coal mining industry in the early 19th century. Carbondale was the site of the first deep vein anthracite coal mine in the United States. It was also a major terminal of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad.
Like many other cities and towns in the region, Carbondale has struggled with the demise of the once-prominent coal mining industry that had once made the region a haven for immigrants seeking work so many decades ago. Immigrants from Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy and from throughout continental Europe came to Carbondale in the course of the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries to work in the anthracite and railroading industries.

[1] The district has a low enrollment of 1,660 pupils in 2016, due to adding free preschool classes. The district encompasses a small area of 18.6 square miles (48 km2). The district operates two schools: Carbondale Area Elementary School (Preschool-6) and Carbondale Area Junior Senior High School (7th–12th).In 2016, the Pittsburgh Business Times ranked Carbondale Area School District declined to 417th out of 493 public school districts for academic achievement of its pupils. In 2012, Carbondale Area School District declined to Warning Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) status, due to lagging student academic achievement. In October 2015, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale reported that Carbondale Elementary School was among the 561 academically challenged schools that have been overlooked by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. He also reported the Pennsylvania Department of Education failed to take any action to remediate the poorly performing schools to raise student academic achievement or to provide them with targeted professional assistance.Carbondale Area School District's graduation rate in 2016 declined to 87%. In 2014 and 2015 it had been 89% High school aged students can attend the taxpayer funded Career Technology Center of Lackawanna County, for training in the building trades, auto mechanics, culinary arts, allied health careers and other areas.
Carbondale residents may also apply to attend any of the Commonwealth's 13 public cyber charter schools (in 2015) at no additional cost to the parents. The resident's public school district is required to pay the charter school and cyber charter school tuition for residents who attend these public schools. The tuition rate that Carbondale Area School District must pay was $8,999 in 2015. In 2014–15, Carbondale Area School District reported spending $13,401.58 per pupil.

Northeastern Educational Intermediate Unit IU#19 provides a wide variety of services to children living in its region, which includes  Carbondale. Early screening, special education services, speech and hearing therapy, autistic support, preschool classes and many other services like driver education are available. Services for children during the preschool years are provided without cost to their families when the child is determined to meet eligibility requirements. Intermediate units receive taxpayer funding: through subsidies paid by member school districts; through direct charges to users for some services; through the successful application for state and federal competitive grants and through private grants.
EnrollmentThe demographic and economic decline beginning in the 1950s with the end of the coal mining industry has left its mark on education. At one time, the City of Carbondale had one public high school, ten public elementary schools, one private Catholic high school, and two private Catholic elementary schools which served a city of just over 23,000 citizens. Over the decades, changes to education, the dramatic population decline down to 8,800 in the 2010 Census, and the disappearance of religious orders have reduced the number of schools to the two mentioned above. Sacred Heart Elementary, formed as a result of the merger between the parochial Mt. Carmel and St. Rose Elementary Schools for the 1998–1999 school year, closed at the end of the 2010–2011 school year and integrated into LaSalle Academy Catholic School in Dickson City. From a peak enrollment in the 1960s of nearly 650 in a K-12 system served in three schools, the school's enrollment has declined to 186.
