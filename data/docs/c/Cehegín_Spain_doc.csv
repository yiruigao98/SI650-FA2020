It has  a population of approximately 16,248 with 8227 males and 8021 females. It is crossed by the rivers Argos and Quipar.


== Agriculture & Business ==
The area has traditionally been an important source of marble, particularly red marble, which is exported as far afield as Japan and Argentina. Agriculture has also been important, with apricot and peach grown on irrigated soils, and olive, almond and vines grown on the drier land. Recent years have seen an increase in the cultivation of flowers under plastic poly-tunnels.  Much of the local produce is pulped into fruit juices in canning facilities in the town. Local  businesses include lawyers' offices, bakeries and construction.


== History ==
The name Cehegín is sometimes connected by Spanish historians with that of the Zenaga, Senhaja or Senajeli, a North African tribe, which invaded Spain in the 11th century. The whole of this territory is layer upon layer of all the various cultures that established themselves here, the first settlers going back to 2400 BC. Reconquered by Alphonse VI with 1,000 horsemen and 11,000 infantrymen, Cehegín is one vast hilltop monument.
Cave paintings at Peña Rubia, a few kilometers outside the town, attest to the area being settled during pre-historic times. The town of Begastri, now abandoned, was settled during the later Bronze Age and was an important town during the time that the region was occupied by the Romans and the Visigoths. With the arrival of the Moors, the town center shifted to its present location at Cehegin. Remains of the Moorish city walls can still be seen, for example at the "Puerta de Caravaca."  The Archaeological Museum can also be found in the Old Town, where the exhibition include also small fragment of Attic red-figured pottery dated to the 4th century BC.Many conquistadores returned from South America with their riches and built large manorial houses in the Old Town.  The Old Town has been revitalised recently by an influx of foreign (mainly British) buyers, who have renovated many of the older properties that were falling into disrepair.
Before it was given the name Cehegín, the town was called Bigastro (not to be confused with the district of Bigastro in the Valencian Community) and began to be an episcopal see when the bishop of Cartagena fled there after the Visigothic king Suintila (c. 588 – 633/635) destroyed that city. It remained a bishopric until Bigastro in its turn was destroyed by Arabs at the end of the 7th century. No longer a residential diocese, Bigastro is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.The pilgrimage town of Caravaca de la Cruz is located about 5 minutes west of Cehegín.  Access to the town from Murcia was much improved by the construction of the C415 motorway in the late 1990s.

== Demographics ==

Like most towns in the region, Cehegín experienced a big demographic increase until 1940. Right after that there was a notable decline in the 1940s and 1960s, followed by a phase of stability. The current trend is clear growth, but the number of cehegineros who emigrate to other countries is still high.
In the district of Valentín (546 inhabitants) an important socio-economic change has taken place with the strong boom experienced by the semi-handicraft industry of clay pottery, destined mainly for export.


== Economy ==
In the 1950s, still in postwar period, one of the most important activities of the town consisted in the cultivation and work of hemp to make handmade footwear, known as "alpargatas" in local slang.
In agriculture, the olive, almond and vineyard have predominated in the dry land, and apricot and peach in irrigation; what allowed from the decade of the 1970s to consolidate a strong industrial fabric manufacturing canner. Some of the most important factories of the time were: Los Isidros, Los Hernández, La Verja or Cofrutos (the latter is still in full operation). This sector gave way in later years to the boom of the marble industry since the town had marble quarries (mainly red marble limestone). This made it possible to strategically place different treatment plants for the mineral, which has been an important engine of development for the local economy for years, although in recent years the economic crisis of 2007 has forced to reduce and drastically modify the templates of these plants.
Cehegín also has a large area of mountains, with the Aleppo pine as the main tree.
In the hamlet of Canara, right next to Cehegín, there has been a great increase in the cultivation of flowers under greenhouse, mainly carnation, gladiolus and chrysanthemum.

The idea of making this feature comes from a group of university friends. It tells the story of Martin de Ambel and Bernad, whom, for killing the Alférez Mayor de la Villa, Don Alonso de Góngora in a duel, is imprisoned. After spending two years locked up in Granada, Martín is granted to return to Cehegín, with the condition that Martín de Ambel can not leave the Ermita de la Concepción. During the 38 years he spends there, not a single day will go by without the suffering and nightmares that his act will entail. "Ambel is a story of honor and blood.''
This film was budgeted for 400,000 euros, however, it has managed to shoot for 28,000 euros budget thanks to the help and selfless work of many people, as well as financial support through crowdfunding, merchandising, and contributions from the town hall.
