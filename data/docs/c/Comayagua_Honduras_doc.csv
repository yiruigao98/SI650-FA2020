Comayagua was founded with the name Santa María de la Nueva Valladolid by Conquistador Alonso de Cáceres under orders from Francisco de Montejo, Governor of Yucatán on 8 December 1537. The complementary names "Valladolid" or "Pais de las Higueras" were those given to it by the Spaniards but it kept the primitivity of the place that is purely indigenous. Some differ in their etymology but most agree that it is composed of "Coma" (which in Lenca dialect means paramo) and "water" being its true meaning "páramo abundant with water".
