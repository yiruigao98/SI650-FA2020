Chakan is a census town in India, in Pune district of the Indian state of Maharashtra.  While agriculture remains an important factor, the town's industrial development is quickly urbanizing the area. 


== History ==
Chakan has a long history. The fort at Chakan played an important role in the history of the Bahmani sultanate (1347-1527) ,later of  its successor states, the Deccan sultanates. In 1595 or 1599, Maloji Bhosle, the grandfather of Shivaji, was given the title of "Raja" by Bahadur Nizam Shah II, the ruler of the Ahmednagar Sultanate.On the recommendation of Nizam's Vazir, Malik Ambar, Maloji was granted the jagir (fiefdom) of Pune and Supe parganas, along with the control over Shivneri and Chakan forts. Later the fort was captured by the Adilshahi but young Shivaji took control of the fort in 1647, and named it Sangramdurg. In 1660,the fort was the site of an epic 54 days of stiff resistance by the Maratha general Firangoji Narsala against Mughal general  Shaista Khan. The fort withstood heavy Mughal attacks until the Mughals breached the walls using high explosives. The  attack on the fort was repulsed by the Maratha forces but short on supplies, Firangoji counterattacked and cut his way deep into the Mughal encampment where he was finally subdued and captured.

Chakan boasts the Sangram Durga or Bhueekot Killa, which was once the domain of Chhatrapati Shivaji. The fort is built on level ground and surrounded by the fortified walls and turrets. It differs from most Indian forts which were traditionally built on hilly, elevated land. 
The Chakreshwar temple is another site of importance. Legend has it that it is the site where King Dasharatha was battling a Rakshasa (Demon King), when the wheel of his ratha (chariot) was stuck in mud near the pond of Chakreshwar. When his wife Kaikeyi helped get the wheel unstuck, Dasharatha granted her three wishes, which eventually led to the exile of Rama and the subsequent events of the epic Ramayana.
In May, Chakan celebrates a major festival called Khandobacha Urus (Yatra)
