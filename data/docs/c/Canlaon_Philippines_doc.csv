== History ==
Canlaon was formerly a part of Vallehermoso as Sitio Mabigo of Barrio Panubigan. In 1941, Isidro Bautista Sr., an geomatic engineer, along with its residents petitioned the Philippine government to convert Mabigo into a separate municipality.


=== World War II ===
During the Second World War, the Japanese Imperial Army captured Canlaon City in April 1942, right after the Battle of Bataan. The Japanese occupation of the City ended in early 1945 when soldiers from the Eighth United States Army under Lieutenant General Robert Eichelberger including the 40th Infantry Division (United States) and the 23rd Infantry Division (United States), landed in Negros Island to drive out the Japanese. In liberating Negros Island, they were assisted by newly formed Philippine Commonwealth military forces & local Negrosanon guerillas who helped in clearing out Japanese pockets of resistance throughout the island. In fact, the honor of liberating Canlaon City from the Japanese went to Philippine Commonwealth soldiers belonging to the 7th, 71st, 73rd and 75th Infantry Regiments of the Philippine Army, the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and Negrosanon Guerillas.
