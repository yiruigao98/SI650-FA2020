== History ==
Appian and Plutarch describe a decisive battle in the Civil War against Gaius Marius the Younger, which took place in 82 BC at Colleferro,   concluded in favor of Sulla. At the end of the siege Marius committed suicide.
At Colleferro Italian patriot Enrico Toti, on 27 March 1908, had his left leg crushed. The train was stopped at the station to be joined with the Colleferro train. Toti was lubricating the engine of the locomotive and, when the locomotives moved, he slipped causing left leg being trapped and crushed by the gears.
The development of the town began as early as 1912 with the conversion of a long disused sugar factory (the Valsacco factory) to an explosive factory. Initially, the town developed away from where the center is today; the first few buildings (including the Church of St. Joachim) were built within the territory of the nearby town of Valmontone, near the train station that was then called "Segni-Paliano", and was renamed "Segni-Station Colleferro" after the birth of the town.
The engineer Leopoldo Parodi Delfino (former senator and son of the founder of the National Bank, then Bank of Italy) and Senator Giovanni Bombrini founded the 'Bombrini Parodi Delfino  explosives factory. Nearby, a new the "BPD Village" was created, and factory workers and their families from throughout Italy moved into them. Later, a cement factory opened (the "Lime & Cement Segni", subsequently acquired by Italcementi), using materials quarried from the nearby town of Segni.
Colleferro continued growing throughout the 1920s and 1930s with still within the municipality of Valmontone. In 1935 Colleferro was incorporated as a new city. Later, Colleferro incorporated portions of the neighboring municipalities of Segni and Paliano.
On 1 February 1938 there was the worst ever explosion at the Bombrini Parodi Delfino (BPD).  The number of dead and wounded and the damage was so severe that the news was reported even in the British Times. Within about three hours with of the explosion, the king, Victor Emmanuel III, Benito Mussolini, along with government and military officials, were in Colleferro to see what happened, visiting the wounded, and planning what to do for the wounded and the town.
During World War II, the Allies repeatedly bombarded Colleferro to destroy the explosives factory. During the attacks, citizens found shelter in a series of caves and tunnels built under the "BPD Village".
In the early 1950s, BPD manufactured Lauryl, the first soap powder in Italy.
On 9 October 2007 one person was killed and eight were injured in an explosion at a weapons factory belonging to Italian company Simmel Difesa.
