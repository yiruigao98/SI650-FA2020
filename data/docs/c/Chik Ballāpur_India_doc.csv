== History ==
The ruler of Avathi Mallabiregowda's son Marigowda was hunting one day in Kodimanchanahalli forest. A rabbit stood in front of the fierce hunting dogs without fear. Seeing this, ruler was elated and told his son that the strength of the rabbit is due to the valour of the region's citizenry. As such the ruler took permission from King of Vijaynagar and built an elaborate fort and formed a city which is now known as Chickballapur. Baichegowda, King of Mysore later attacked the fort but had to withdraw due to the valiant efforts of the Chikkaballapura citizens and aid from the Marathas. Sri Dodda Byregowda who came to power after Baichegowda acquired the land, which was taken by Mysore king. In 1762 during the ruling of Chikkappanayaka, Hyder Ali captured the town for a period of 3 months. Then Chikkappanayaka agreed to pay 5-lakhs pagodas, and then the army was taken back.
After this, Chikkappa Nayaka with the help of Murariraya of Guthy tried to restore his powers. He was hiding at Nandi Hills along with Chikkappa Nayaka. Immediately, Hyder Ali acquired Chikkaballapur and other places and arrested Chikkappa Nayaka. Then with interfere of Lord Corn Wallis, Chikkaballapur was handed over to Narayanagowda. After knowing this, Tippu Sultan again acquired Chikkaballapur . In 1791 British occupied Nandi & left Narayanagowda to rule the town. Due to this treachery, a fight broke out between the Britishers and Tippu Sultan. Narayanagowda lost his administration. Later, the British defeated Tippu in a bitter battle which led to tremendous loss of life on both sides. The citizens of Chikkaballapur, however, refused to be subjugated and maintained their warrior pride.
