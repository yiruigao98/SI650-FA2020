Charkhi Dadri is a city and headquarters of Charkhi Dadri district in the state of Haryana, India, about 90 km from Delhi.  The town was made by joining the villages of Charkhi and Dadri after urban development. Charkhi Dadri, located in southern Haryana 110 kilometres (68 mi) from the national capital of New Delhi, is on NH 148B between Narnaul to Bathinda and NH 348B between Meerut to Pilani segment passing through the city.


== Etymology ==
"Dadri" is derived from a lake called Dadar which was full of dadur (Sanskrit: frog) from which it took its current name. To distinguish Dadri from other similarly named places in the area, sometimes Dadri's name was appended to the nearby village of Charkhi. After India became independent, in recognition of the contribution of people of Charki village during the first war of independence in 1857 against the British colonial rule and Praja Mandala movement against the oppressive rule of the Jind State, the government officially named the town as Charkhi-Dadri.When Ramkrishna Dalmia, the founder of Dalmia Group, established a cement factory at Dadri during the rule of Jind State, the town was renamed as "Dalmia Dadri" on request of Sir Ganga Ram Kaul who was then Chief Minister of Jind State, which was renamed to "Charkhi Dadri" when Jind State was merged with Patiala and the East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) in 1948.

He was removed to Lahore. Dadri was awarded to Raja Sarup Singh of Jind for his services to EIC in the 1857 war. In May 1864, some fifty villages revolted against his descendant Raja Raghbir Singh but the rebellion was crushed.
