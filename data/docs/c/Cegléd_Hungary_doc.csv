Cegléd (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈt͡sɛɡleːd]; German: Zieglet) is a city in Pest county, Hungary, approximately 70 km (43 mi) southeast of the Hungarian capital, Budapest.


== Name ==
The name of the town is of disputed origin. The name may be derived from the word "szeglet" (meaning "corner") due to its being a junction point of several important routes, while it may also have been derived from a proper name, i. e. from the name of a man called "Cegléd".
The most likely explanation derives the name from the noun "cigle" or "cegle", the old Hungarian name of a rivercoast willow.


== History ==
Its area has been inhabited since the Copper Age. It was first mentioned in 1290 in a decree by Ladislaus IV of Hungary. The town prospered under the Árpád dynasty until the 13th century Mongol invasion of Hungary left it in ruins.
It was reinhabitated later, and on May 8, 1364 Louis I of Hungary relieved the town from paying customs. The king gave the town to his queen, Elisabeth, who ceded it to the Clarissa sisters.
During the 1514 György Dózsa peasant uprising, Cegléd was a very important hive for rebellions, and one of the biggest supporters of them. After the catastrophe of the Battle of Mohács (1526) Cegléd came under the power of Bálint Török of Enying.
The Reformation rapidly spread through the town, and the Calvinists owned the old church of the Clarissa-sisters till 1687, when the Turks were forced out.
At the beginning of the 18th century, Cegléd supported the fight for freedom led by Ferenc Rákóczi, although inhabitants were several times forced by Habsburg troops to flee.
After the Treaty of Tolerance, they were allowed to construct a church for themselves and the reformed community. This church was doomed by the Great 1834 Fire. By the next year a new construction was started under the plans of József Hild. The church was finished in 1870, and became the symbol of the town.
The other symbol of Cegléd is Lajos Kossuth. During his 1848 conscription tour, he told his famous speech in the Market Place of Cegléd. By his words more than 5000 men joined his army for the victory. Later his son, Ferenc Kossuth became the deputy of Cegléd in the Hungarian parliament. During the 1848-1849 war of independence, one battle passed next to Cegléd, in Bede (today one of the outskirts of the town), when the revolutionary troops of Mór Perczel defeated the Habsburgs, led by Ottinger. In July 1849, due to the political situation, Cegléd was the seat of the Hungarian revolutionary government for a week.
The golden age of the town were the last years of the 19th and the first ones of the 20th century. The town went through a quick urbanisation, got a secondary school and many important public facilities were built. Cegléd also saw the organisation of the first-ever Hungarian collective farm in 1902 (based on free will back then).
In the Second World War the Cegléd train station was bombed by Allied forces, which caused severe damage to the town. However, parks and streets were fairly quickly rebuilt, thanks to the inhabitants.
Jews settled in Cegléd in the first half of the 19th Century, forming a Neologist congregation in 1869 and reaching a peak in 1910. A Jewish school was in operation until the Holocaust and a Synagogue was built in 1905. In 1941 all men in the community were sent to forced labor labor in Ukraine where most died. 659 Jews remained. They were deported to Auschwitz after being expelled to Kecskemet in June 1944. In 1946 150 survivors reestablished the community.
During the 1956 revolution, for a couple of days Cegléd was governed by revolutionary forces, organised mainly by pupils of the local Kossuth Lajos Secondary School.
During the Communist regime, agriculture and light industry were made priorities, and after the fall of the regime, these features started to decline, and many of the inhabitants moved to bigger towns. Today, however, the town seems to have refound itself on the base of tourism and its thermal water.

The city hall is constructed in an eclectic style, reflecting the taste of the early 20th century.
