Erigavo (Somali: Ceerigaabo), also spelled as Erigabo, is the capital and largest city of the Sanaag region of Somaliland.


== History ==

The Erigavo settlement is several centuries old. The surrounding area was supposedly built by the Madigan Dir. Modern Erigavo was founded by the Musa Ismail sub-clan of the Habr Yunis as a Home Well for passing nomads and caravans. The general area is noted for its numerous historical tombs, where various Somali clan patriarchs are buried. As of 2013, Erigavo is the administrative capital of the northern Sanaag region. It is also the center of the Erigavo District.

=== Environment ===

10 km (6 m) to the north of the town are the remains of a juniper forest, running along the edge of the escarpment overlooking the Gulf of Aden. The escarpment is approximately 2,000 m (6,562 ft) above sea level, where the road from Erigavo drops down to the coast. 2 km (1.2 mi) to the west, it rises to the highest point in Somaliland, Shimbiris. A popular local attraction, the summit sits at an elevation of about 2670 m above sea level. A road also leads up from Erigavo to Daallo mountain. At the mountain's peak, the sea can be observed in addition to the ancient town of Hiis situated nearby.
Erigavo is also home to many animal and plant species. Wildlife native to the area include dorcas gazelle, gerenuk, Salt's dik-dik, hamadryas baboon, desert warthog, spotted hyena, striped hyena, black-backed jackal, African golden wolf, honey badger and Somali ostrich.

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Erigavo features a mild version of the semi-arid climate. The city generally sees equable temperatures year round, with some of the mildest weather in all of Somaliland. Despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude, temperatures rarely exceed 30 degrees Celsius. Nights are frequently chilly, even during the summer season. This is a trait shared with very few places in the world; notable locations with similar climate are Sana'a in Yemen or Arequipa in Peru. The city receives on average under 400 mm of precipitation annually. Average monthly temperatures range from 14.3 C in the month of December to 19.7 C in the month of July. Absolute minimum temperatures sometimes touch or cross zero degrees Celsius isotherm.
