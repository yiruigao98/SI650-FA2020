== History ==
The town of Clifton turned 100 years-old in 2017 but documented settlements in the area date back to 1679 when indigenous leader, Captahem, gifted a deed for 11,000 acres along the shores of the Passaic river to Hans Frederick. The modern name of "Clifton" was derived from the cliffs of Garrett Mountain which borders the Montclair Heights neighborhood in the western part of the city. Clifton was an agricultural hub and home to the U.S. Animal Quarantine Station was operated in Clifton by the United States Department of Agriculture starting in 1903. It was served by the Newark Branch of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad. It was the primary location on the East Coast where animals from poultry, horses and cattle to zoo animals were held in quarantine after being brought into the United States to ensure that the animals were not infected with diseases that could be spread in the U.S. The station operated in Clifton until the late 1970s, when the facility was relocated to Stewart International Airport.Although Clifton and surrounding towns have long converted from farmlands to suburban communities, given their close proximity to Manhattan (Clifton is less than 15 miles directly west from Midtown), the town still boasts two small working farms that sell fresh organic vegetables in-season:

Ploch's Farm: A family-run 15-acre farm since 1867.
City Green Farm Eco Center: An organic farm and 501(c)3 non-profit focused on promoting urban farming and education since 2004.

== Government ==


=== Local government ===
The city of Clifton is governed under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law. The city is one of seven municipalities (of the 565) statewide governed under this form. The governing body is the City Council, which is comprised of seven council members, with all positions elected at-large on a non-partisan basis to concurrent four-terms of office as part of the November general election. The mayor is chosen by the City Council, with the position traditionally given to the top vote getter in the previous election. Clifton's municipal elections had been held in May as required for municipalities conducting non-partisan elections. Following the passage of a state law in 2010 allowing non-partisan elections to be shifted to November, Clifton voters were overwhelmingly in favor of the move in a non-binding referendum held in November 2013. On December 13, 2013, the Clifton City Council voted 6–0, with one abstention, to make the move to a November election binding, which had the effect of extending the terms of all sitting council members by six months, from June 30 to December 31. Officials cited increased voter participation and reduced costs as the justifications behind supporting the shift.As of 2020, Clifton's mayor is James Anzaldi, whose term of office ends December 31, 2022. Anzaldi has been a member of the City Council since 1978 and was first selected to be mayor in 1990, succeeding two-term Mayor Gloria Kolodziej. Anzaldi is the first mayor in Clifton's history to be elected to six terms. The other members of the City Council are Peter C. Eagler, William "Bill" Gibson, Raymond Grabowski, Lauren E. Murphy, Rosemary Pino and Mary Sadrakula, all of whom are serving concurrent terms of office that end on December 31, 2022.


=== Vacancies ===
If at any time a seat becomes vacant on the council, it is filled by special election unless the vacancy occurs during a council election year. In the interim, the council is allowed to appoint an interim councilperson to fill the seat until the election can take place (again, except when the entire council is up for election); common practice is to nominate the eighth-place candidate from the previous election.
The city has done this four times since 1990:

In 1992, Councilman George Bayeux died in office. That fall, Richard Stockinger was elected to take his place.
Stockinger became the next council member to die in office, succumbing to lung cancer in March 1996. The special election to fill his seat was won by Ed Welsh.
In 2006, after the new council was elected, Antonio Latona was disqualified from taking his newly elected office as it was determined he was involved in a conflict of interest due to his employment by the city fire department. City policy dictates that the next highest vote getter in the election be appointed to a vacancy, and thus the seat was filled by Matthew Ward as the candidate with the eighth highest total. The special election to fill the vacancy was held in November 2007, with Ward retaining his seat.
In February 2015, just after he was sworn into office for a second term, Councilman Matt Grabowski died from cancer. The council appointed Joseph Cupoli, the highest vote-getter among the losing candidates, to fill the seat until the November election. Raymond Grabowski, the councilman's brother, won the special election to serve out the remainder of the term.
