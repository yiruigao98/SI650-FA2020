Ciudad Obregón is the second largest city in the northern Mexican state of Sonora and named for Sonoran revolutionary general and president of Mexico, Álvaro Obregón. It is 525 km (326 mi) south of the state's northern border with the US state of Arizona. It is also the municipal seat of Cajeme municipality, located in the Yaqui Valley.


== History ==
The city, previously named Cajeme, takes its name from Mexican Revolutionary Álvaro Obregón, a native of nearby Huatabampo, Sonora. Álvaro Obregón became president of Mexico after the Revolution and initiated an "agricultural revolution" in the Yaqui Valley, introducing modern agricultural techniques and making this valley one of the most prosperous agricultural regions in the country. Renowned US agronomist Dr. Norman Borlaug, the architect of the "Green Revolution" worked here after successful developments in increasing the resistance of wheat. For his efforts he was later awarded the Nobel Prize.
The origins of this city date back to the year 1906 when the company's rail track South Pacific Railway reached this area of the Yaqui Valley; this route, made it possible to incorporate with the Mayo Valley to the domestic and external market, attracting a wave of investors and settlers who brought out populations.
In 1907, a flag station was established for the locomotive crossing the state to supply water, this station was called Cajeme. Cajemé was a Yaqui leader (whose population lives in this area) who fought against them as part of the Porphyrian army; and then led the Yaqui rebellion against it Porfirio Díaz.
"The Cajeme station was run by the American Bert Cameron, superintendent, and Emilio Estrella, station manager. They and their families were the first settlers. Soon after, the cowboys arrived to guard the corrals of cattle that from here was sent to other regions. Soon came neighbors of Hope, near the fields cultivated in the Valley." The Yaquis offered resistance to the arrival of the first settlers on their lands.
The first neighborhood was called Plan Oriente. In 1923, 'Cajeme Motors' was installed, owned by American James Huffaker, it was the first auto agency; fact that contributed significantly to the development of Cajeme. At the end of his term as president of the country (1920–1924), the General Alvaro Obregón returned to Sonora and carried out business projects in Navojoa and Cajeme, creating in 1925, the company 'Obregón y Cía.', which provided more work and economic development in the Region.
29 November 1927 was declared the head of the municipality (until then it had been part of Cocorit) by the governor Fausto Topete, and in 1928 year in which the first town hall was installed, it was decreed on 28 July of the same year on 28 July of the same year change of name to Ciudad Obregón in recognition of Alvaro Obregón, while the name of the municipality was preserved. That same year the first printing press was installed and it was where the first news weekly called 'The Pacific Gazette', owned by Lithuanian immigrant Leo Rosenfeld and his wife Virginia Gámez, was printed.
The first colonies were Plano Oriente, Ladrillera, Cumuripa, Hidalgo, Constitución, El Castillo, Quinta Díaz, Bella Vista and Colonia del Valle.
Rice was the most important crop in the Yaqui Valley in the early [twentieth century]; other crops also include wheat, beans, chickpeas, various vegetables and alfalfa. Over the course of the century, wheat became the most important crop. Due to Cajeme's agricultural vocation, the first industry of great importance was rice mills.
In the 1950s the agronomist Norman E. Borlaug (called the Father of the Green Revolution) collaborated with the creation of the Northwest Agricultural Research Center (CIANO) and in 1970 received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in research developing better varieties of wheat and maize.
At the end of the twentieth century the railway disappeared as a means of transport for passengers and the station was abandoned.
For the development of productive activities, local commerce offers everything from re-shareholders, agricultural implement stores, agribusiness machinery, safety equipment and all kinds of inputs for production. There are two markets for supplies.
For the realization of economic activities and service to the general public, Ciudad Obregón has offices of the main financial institutions of the country.

Cajeme Municipality has as its head Ciudad Obregón. Its first settlers established themselves in the neighborhood called Plano Oriente, as irrigation canals made by the Richardson company around 1910 and two years later, the South Pacific railroad established a station called Cajeme. The town of Cajeme was initially a part of Cocorit Municipality until its elevation to Municipal Seat on 28 September 1927. The first city government was established on 1 January 1928.

== Roots and traditions ==
The Yaqui people are settled in eight towns, Potam, Huirivis, Torim, Cocorit, Bacum, Vicam, Rahum and Belem. seven kilometres (4.3 miles) from the city is the first of the eight Yaqui towns that make the autonomous territory of these people known for their independent character, because it is one of the few American ethnic groups not dominated militarily by Spanish colonialists.
Yaqui history is covered with acts of heroic resistance for the defense of their territory and culture, an ancestral culture enriched by rites and traditions of which the Deer Dance stands out, a symbolic representation of the hunt for this animal whose aesthetic richness has awakened interest the world over.
In the rites of Passover and Easter, or in the Day of the Dead celebration, Yaqui culture reaches its highest splendor and shows us the survival of mystery, the unity of man with the universe and the intimate relationship between people and the nature that surrounds them.
One day the wind of Passover takes the Pharisees to roam the nearby cities hidden behind leather masks; another day rivalries and mundane ambitions are forgotten so that the whole tribe may join in the commemoration of its faithfully departed. Men and women that practice traditional medicine apply ancient knowledge passed on by their ancestors and with herbs and ointments cure the sickness of their relatives.
Dance, music, traditional medicine and Yaqui festivities are the expression of a magical world of religion that coexists in harmony with western culture. Obregon City is also Birthplace to one of its most notorious past inhabitants: El huilito Rojas from the very first settlement in obregon city: plano oriente of Cardenas Ave. and Guerrero.
