Ciudad Guayana (Spanish pronunciation: [sjuˈðað ɣwaˈʝana]) is a city in Bolívar State, Venezuela. It stretches 40 kilometers along the south bank of the Orinoco river, at the point where it is joined by its main tributary, the Caroní river. The Caroni crosses the city south-north and divides it on its two main halves: the old town of San Félix in the east, and the new town of Puerto Ordaz (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpweɾto oɾˈðas]) in the west. The city was officially founded in 1961 by the unification of this two former settlements, but the history of San Félix goes back to its foundation in 1724. Within the city limits are located the site of Cachamay Falls and Llovizna Falls. There are three bridges across the Caroni and the second crossing over the Orinoco, the Orinoquia Bridge, was inaugurated in the city in 2006. With approximately one million people, it is Venezuela's fastest-growing city due to its important iron, steel, aluminium and hydroelectric industries. Ciudad Guayana is one of Venezuela's five most important ports, since most goods produced in the industry-rich Bolívar state are shipped through it, as ocean-going vessels can sail to it from the Atlantic Ocean up the Orinoco river.
Due to its planned nature, the city has a drastically different feel from many other South American cities. The towers of the Alta Vista district recall Barranquilla, and many of the residential neighborhoods have architecture and landscaping that are similar to suburbs in the United States in the 1950s, including 'cookie cutter' homes, sidewalks, and patterned lawns. This is an artifact due to the presence in the 1960s and early 1970s of US Steel, an American company with iron mining operations in the region. US Steel built housing for hundreds of its American expatriate workers and families, who lived in Puerto Ordaz and other communities until the nationalization of the Venezuelan steel industry forced the company and its workers to leave.
Guayana City is served by Manuel Carlos Piar Guayana Airport.


== History ==
The first explorations of Diego de Ordaz were organized in 1531. An expedition
led by Juan González Sosa discovered previously unknown jungles and plains on 
the banks of the Orinoco River. In 1535, another expedition into the region was led by Lieutenant Alfonso Herrera. It
was after the movements of conquest and colonization, when in 1591 Antonio de Berrio founded Santo Tome de Guayana at the confluence of the Caroni and Orinoco, in the country of Carapana near the Indian village of Cachamay.
The city was founded multiple times in different places, due to the continuous attacks of pirates and conquerors which destroyed it as they went down the Orinoco River in search of El Dorado.
In 1618, when he was near the old Guiana, an English expedition sent by Walter Raleigh sacked and destroyed the city entirely. In 1764, the residents were relocated to Angostura, now Ciudad Bolivar, due to the continuous attacks of English and Dutch pirates. The last foundation took place at its original site on July 2, 1961 and was called Ciudad Guayana. West of the city is the Matanzas Industrial Zone, the urban area of Puerto Ordaz in the middle east and San Felix.
For the design and city planning Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana 
requested the participation of the then Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies (USA). The
large and extensive program of building highways and avenues, 
residential areas, schools, hospitals and recreational facilities, 
continues with the same intensity since its inception, ready to house 2.5
million people in 2020. Since 1961, the city has been known as one of the fastest growing in the world.
Ciudad Guayana and the surrounding site have special interest to visitors. Within
the city, the Caroni park consisting of parks Drizzle, Cachamay and 
Loefling, which are a representative sample of the majesty and beauty of
the Rio Caroni. Other amusement park attractions include the Foundation
and Paseo Malecon San Felix. For
those interested in the basic industries of Venezuela some of these 
have a visitation schedule that could be found through their respective 
managements of Public Relations. Nearby,
less than 100 kilometers away it is Ciudad Bolívar, the historic site of Bolivar state. On the other side of the river is the 
Mission of Caroni (Caroni ruins), the Castillos de Guayana and forest 
plantations.
