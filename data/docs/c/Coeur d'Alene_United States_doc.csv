Coeur d'Alene ( (listen) KOR də-LAYN, French: Cœur d'Alène, lit. 'Heart of an Awl', pronounced [kœʁ dalɛn]) is the largest city and county seat of Kootenai County, Idaho, United States. It is the principal city of the Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 2019, the United States Census Bureau estimated the city's population at 52,414. The city is a satellite city of Spokane, which is located about thirty miles (50 km) to the west in the state of Washington. The two cities are the key components of the Spokane–Coeur d'Alene combined statistical area, of which Coeur d'Alene is the third-largest city (after Spokane and its largest suburb, Spokane Valley). Coeur d'Alene is the largest city in North Idaho and the city is situated on the north shore of the 25-mile (40 km) long Lake Coeur d'Alene and to the west of the Coeur d'Alene Mountains. Locally, Coeur d'Alene is known as the "Lake City," or simply called by its initials: "CDA."
The city is named after the Coeur d'Alene people, a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans who lived along the rivers and lakes of the region, in a territory of 4,000,000 acres (16,000 km2) from eastern Washington to Montana.
The native peoples were hunter-gatherers who located their villages and camps near food gathering or processing sites and followed the seasonal cycles, practicing subsistence hunting, fishing, and foraging.
The origins of the city began with being a fort town; General William Tecumseh Sherman sited what became known as Fort Sherman on the north shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene in 1878. Peopling of the town came when miners and prospectors came to the region after gold and silver deposits were found in what would become the Silver Valley and after the Northern Pacific Railroad reached the town in 1883. In the 1890s, two significant miners' uprisings over wages took place in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District, one which became motivation for the bombing assassination of former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg in 1905. The late 19th century discovery of highly prized white pine in the forests of northern Idaho resulted in a timber boom that peaked in the late 1920s and was accompanied by the rapid population growth which led to the incorporation of the city on September 4, 1906. After the Great Depression, tourism started to become a major source of development in the area and by the 1980s it became the major driver in the local economy after decades of heavy reliance on logging, the city featured a more balanced economy with manufacturing, retail and service sectors.
The city of Coeur d'Alene has grown significantly since the 1990s, in part because of a substantial increase in tourism, encouraged by several resorts and recreational activities in the area and outmigration predominantly from other western states. The Coeur d'Alene Resort and its 0.75-mile (1.21 km) floating boardwalk and a 165-acre (0.67 km2) natural area called Tubbs Hill take up a prominent portion of the city's downtown. Popular parks such as City Park and Beach and McEuen Park are also are fixtures of the downtown waterfront. The city has become somewhat of a destination for golfers, having five courses in the city which includes the Coeur d'Alene Resort Golf Course and its unique 14th hole floating green; there are also several ski resorts and other recreation areas nearby, including Silver Mountain Resort to the east in Kellogg, Lookout Pass Ski and Recreation Area also to the east on Lookout Pass at the Montana border, and Schweitzer Mountain Ski Resort to the north in Sandpoint. The largest theme park in the Pacific Northwest, Silverwood Theme Park, is located approximately twenty miles (30 km) north and the Coeur d'Alene Casino and its Circling Raven Golf Club is located approximately 27 miles (43 km) south. The city has become known for having one of the largest Holiday Light Shows in the United States and hosting a popular Ironman Triathlon event and is home to the Museum of North Idaho and North Idaho College. 
Coeur d'Alene is located on the route of Interstate 90 where it is 34 miles (55 km) east of Spokane by road and is served by the Coeur d'Alene Airport as well as the Brooks Seaplane Base by air. In print media, local issues are covered by the Coeur d'Alene Press daily newspaper which has a circulation of about 17,000.


== History ==

The Coeur d'Alene people called themselves by the autonym Schitsu'umsh in Coeur d'Alene, one of the Salishan languages, meaning "those who are found here" or "the found ones". These Native Americans lived along the rivers and lakes of the region, in a territory of 4,000,000 acres (16,000 km2) extending from eastern Washington to Montana; these tribes primarily located their villages and camps near food gathering or processing sites. The built environment of the camps featured conical lodges constructed from poles and mats sewn from tule or animal hides. The Coeur d'Alene people were hunter-gatherers following the seasonal cycles who practiced subsistence hunting of wild game and fishing during the salmon runs, and then foraging for berries and other edibles along the shores of the regions numerous lakes and rivers. The introduction of the horse made hunting and transportation more efficient.
The area was extensively explored by fur trader David Thompson of the North West Company starting in 1809 when he established the Kullyspell House trading post on Lake Pend Orielle.[a] Thompson, who usually used native names to describe the places and people he came across for unexplained reasons ascribed the name of "Pointed Hearts" to one the tribes he traded with and "Pointed Heart Lake" for the lake they lived near. Since Thompson traveled with French-speaking Iroquois guides and scouts, it has been speculated that they may have been the first to refer to the tribe as the Coeur d'Alene. As French was the spoken language of the Canadian fur traders, it is likely that “pointed heart” has its origins in the French transliteration of Cœur or "heart", d’ or "in the middle of" and Alêne or "awl" meaning the tribal traders had hearts as sharp as the tip of an awl or sharp hearted and were shrewd, tough businessmen.The Oregon boundary dispute (or Oregon question) arose as a result of competing British and American claims to the Pacific Northwest of North America in the first half of the 19th century. The British had trading ties extending from Canada and had started settlements in present-day British Columbia and at Fort Astoria on the Pacific coast near the mouth of the Columbia River. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended the disputed joint occupation of the area in present-day Idaho when Britain ceded all rights to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States. In another territorial dispute, the U.S. government through Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens began to negotiate treaties that would begin to move the various tribes of the region onto reservation lands. These talks sparked armed hostilities between the native Coeur d'Alene, Spokane and Palouse and the settler populations that resulted in an initial victory for the tribes at the Battle of Steptoe Butte but was followed up with George Wright's campaign that subdued the natives. The Coeur d'Alene Reservation is located in Benewah and Kootenai counties south of Coeur d'Alene in communities focused around Worley and Plummer.With the discovery of gold out west and the establishment of Idaho Territory in 1863, there was an increase in settlers to the region. When General William Tecumseh Sherman was commander of the U.S. Army during the Indian Wars and following the defeat of General George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn, he erected several forts in the west. During a tour of the Inland Northwest on his way to Fort Walla Walla on the Mullan Road, he was impressed by the scenery of the area and ordered a fort constructed on the lake in 1877 and gave it the name Fort Coeur d'Alene. The fort which gave the city its name was established in 1878 and the name of the fort was later changed to Fort Sherman to honor the general.

Miners and prospectors came to the region after gold and silver deposits were found in the Coeur d'Alene mountains and the Northern Pacific Railroad came to the village in 1883. The village became the location where ore from the mining district was ferried and transferred to the rail lines from steamboats that traveled down from the Coeur d'Alene River from the Cataldo Mission. The township was officially incorporated by petition on August 22, 1887. In the 1890s, two significant miners' uprisings took place in the Coeur d'Alene Mining District, where the workers struggled with high risk and low pay. In 1892, the union's discovery of a labor spy in their midst, in the person of Charlie Siringo, a sometime cowboy and Pinkerton agent, resulted in a strike that developed into a shooting war between miners and the company in Burke Canyon. When the mine owners planned to reduce wages depending on job duties to mitigate increased costs, the miners declared a strike against the reduction of wages and the increase in work hours and demanded a "living wage" be paid to every man working underground–the common laborer as well as the skilled; in an era when many unions were AFL craft unions, in which skilled workers frequently looked after their own kind, this was an unusual circumstance—approximately three thousand higher-paid miners standing up for five hundred lower-paid "common" laborers. This principle of industrial unionism would animate Western hardrock miners for the next several decades. To restore order to the state of rebellion in Shoshone County, Governor N. B. Willey declared martial law and sent federal troops to arrest and detain the union miners, but not before dozens of casualties including six deaths and the destruction of the Frisco Mill. Years later Harry Orchard, who owned a share of the Hercules Mine in the nearby mountains before it began producing, confessed to a secret, brutal and little understood role in the Colorado Labor Wars. He later confessed to dynamiting a $250,000 mill belonging to the Bunker Hill Mining Company near Wardner during another similar miners' uprising in 1899. He later returned to Idaho to assassinate former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg in 1905. In the 1899 riot, Steunenberg declared martial law and asked President William McKinley to send federal troops to quell the unrest.
After a U.S. Geological Survey done in the 1890s, it became widely known that there were large quantities of white pine, a highly prized softwood, in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains. The lumber industry from the eastern US began to inventory the timberlands, acquire land, and invest in facilities across much of northern Idaho. This was welcome relief to the town of Coeur d'Alene, which had been losing population and reeling from the Panic of 1893, a flood, and the closure of Fort Sherman.[b] Coeur d'Alene incorporated as a city on September 4, 1906, and by 1908 it had become the county seat. The city experienced significant growth from the timber boom, the development of the railroads and steamboats, and tourism. From 1900 to 1915, there were seventy additions platted and hundreds of homes built. With the advent of the automobile and the internal combustion engine, trucks and chainsaws, the felling and transporting of trees became more productive and efficient and lumber production reached its height in the late 1910s and 1920s; in 1925 there were seven lumber mills operating in the area and was producing 500 million board feet of lumber.After the 1929 stock market crash and during the Great Depression, the lumber industry demand began to wane and by the mid 1930s about half the woodworkers in northern Idaho were laid off and the surviving mills were producing only 160 million board feet of lumber per year. Although a tough time, the depression years saw the creation of Coeur d'Alene Junior College (North Idaho College) in 1933, Northwest Boulevard through the Works Progress Administration program in 1937 and the building of the popular Playfair Pier amusement park on the lake in the early 1940s. The Playfair Pier opened on July 4, 1942 (and existed until 1974) in City Park and included a variety of rides and attractions such as a miniature roller coaster, a Ferris wheel, a carousel, in addition to some of the usual carnival games. Coeur d'Alene benefited from its proximity to the Farragut Naval Training Station established in 1942 on the south end of Lake Pend Oreille, which employed 22,000 people and needed 98 million board feet of lumber to build 650 buildings.

Due to the scenic lake, tourism has always been a factor in the local economy, where it had become popular in Spokane to travel and picnic in the City Park, shop downtown, and take steamboat cruises on the lake and Saint Joe River, it had also received national publicity in magazines where it had been called a “wonderland” and “The Lucerne of America”. However, tourism began to become a mainstay of the economy with the completion of highway infrastructure projects in the 1950s and 60s and the Coeur d'alene Chamber of Commerce began to promote the city as a tourist destination as well. 
As tourism increased, lodging facilities and demand for other amenities catering to them such as motels, convention space, restaurants, and cultural activities began to increase. By 1976, the city had over 30 motels with about 1,500 rooms. On June 14, 1958 the city hosted the first Diamond Cup Hydroplane race which was one of the largest events in its history and the event garnered national publicity and media coverage. The event attendance was 30,000 people and was considered a success by the Diamond Cup organizers and the race was held at Lake Coeur d'alene for the next eight years until it was eventually discontinued due to persistent difficulties in raising funds for the event.After decades of heavy reliance on logging, in the 1980s, the city featured a more balanced economy with manufacturing, retail and service sectors. Tourism has taken on even more prominence and became one of the main drivers of the local economy since the start of the 1980s, which saw new investment into recreational tourism in the area. In 1982, the city saw the opening of a $2 million Wild Waters aquatic theme park, and spring of 1986 saw the opening of the $60 million and 18 story Coeur d'alene Resort. The waterfront resort featured a well manicured frontage and a publicly accessible floating boardwalk that gave visitors the impression of a park-like environment and made Coeur d'alene a major tourist destination in the eyes of many as it attracted the attention of publications nationwide. Also attracting attention in the media during this time were the actions of the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group founded by Richard Butler in 1974 after he retired and moved north of the city from out of state. Butler's acolytes, many of whom were also transplants were linked to several robberies, murders, and three bombings which included a Spokesman-Review office. In 1986, Coeur d'Alene was presented the Raoul Wallenberg Award for its stand in countering the message of the white supremacists that moved into the area in a nonconfrontational and peaceful manner. These efforts by the city and community against racism and its economic development efforts also helped the city garner the All-America City Award in 1990.In the 1990s, the Coeur d'Alene area starting experiencing a substantial amount of population growth; many of these initial transplants came from California citing earthquakes, crime, and overcrowding as reasons for their move. This northward migration coincided with watershed events such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The state of Idaho has received much in-migration and is the fastest-growing state in the country. According to Census Bureau data in 2018, the city and county were among the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the nation with a net migration of about 3,200 residents from 2015 to 2016. The sources of the newest transplants are still mainly from other western states and are moving for economic as well as political reasons, seeking a lower cost of living, more affordable housing, an outdoor lifestyle and a place that is more conservative.


== Geography ==

Coeur d'Alene is located at 47°41′34″N 116°46′48″W (47.692845, −116.779910), at an elevation of 2,180 ft (660 m) above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.08 square miles (41.65 km2), of which, 15.57 square miles (40.33 km2) is land and 0.51 square miles (1.32 km2) is water.Coeur d'Alene is 30 miles (48 km) east of downtown Spokane, Washington, and 259 miles (415 km) east of Seattle. The city is part of the Spokane–Coeur d'Alene metropolitan area and Inland Northwest region, consisting of eastern Washington, north Idaho, northwestern Montana, and northeastern Oregon.The city located on the north shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene near the outlet of the Spokane River and is in the Northern Rockies ecoregion. Lake Coeur d'Alene is a natural dam-controlled lake that is 25 miles (40 km) long and 1 mile (1.6 km) to 3 miles (4.8 km) wide and fed by the Coeur d'Alene and Saint Joe Rivers. Although the Post Falls Dam on the Spokane River near Post Falls controls the lake levels, the lake is usually kept at natural levels from January to June. To the immediate southeast is  Fernan Lake and to the northeast of the city is Hayden Lake and even further northeast in northern Kootenai County is Lake Pend Orielle which is among the largest and deepest natural lakes in the western United States with a surface area of 85,960 acres (347.9 km2) and maximum depth of 1,152 feet (351 m). The Coeur d'Alene Mountains of the Bitterroot Range rise to the east of the city to a maximum elevation of 7,352 feet (2,241 m) at Cherry Peak.The wooded lands east of the city have been designated for protection and management as the Coeur d'Alene National Forest. The city is surrounded by lakes and forests that support a variety of wildlife. The large lakes in the Idaho panhandle attract birds on the Pacific Flyway and bird watching is popular on Lake Coeur d'Alene, especially from November to February when bald eagles come annually to feed on the spawning kokanee. The Cougar Bay Nature Preserve on the northeast portion of Lake Coeur d'Alene is the closest and most accessible nature preserve for wildlife viewing, as it is only minutes from downtown Coeur d'Alene.


=== Climate ===

Coeur d'Alene has, depending on the definition, a dry-summer continental climate (Köppen Dsb), or a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb), characterized by a cold, moist climate in winter, and very warm, dry conditions in summer. The monthly daily mean temperature ranges from 29.8 °F (−1.2 °C) in December to 69.0 °F (20.6 °C) in July and August. Temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on 13 days per year, only occasionally reaching 100 °F (38 °C), while conversely, there may be several nights below 10 °F (−12 °C). Snowfall averages 32.4 inches (82 cm) per year and precipitation averages 25.68 inches (65.2 cm) per year and is generally lowest in summer. The average first and last freeze of the season are October 12 and May 3, respectively. The city straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 6B and 7A. The Spokane–Coeur d'Alene area has many microclimates that can have different weather patterns and observations than the nearby official reporting stations used by the National Weather Service due to the diversity of the topography and other factors. For instance, northern Idaho experiences more precipitation than eastern Washington from weather systems originating from the Pacific Ocean because it is on the windward side of the Rocky Mountains and also Coeur d'Alene can have noticeably milder nights and cooler days due to the moderating effect on the climate of large bodies of water such as Lake Coeur d'Alene.


=== Cityscape ===


==== Neighborhoods ====

As Coeur d'Alene has grown from a fort town, different neighborhoods and suburbs have grown around it. The historic downtown city center of Coeur d'Alene in the southeast of the urban area as the presence of Hayden Lake and Lake Fernan and the Coeur d'Alene mountains inhibit development to the east and Lake Coeur d'Alene and the Spokane River limit development to the south and southwest. Historic additions from the early 1900s were added close to the city center a few blocks from downtown, such as on East Sherman Avenue, East Lakeshore Drive near Sanders Beach, and near present-day City Park. Today, the city has many neighborhoods, the largest being Coeur d'Alene city center, Post Falls and Hayden. The Coeur d'Alene city center has several parks and attractions and as a community gathering place, it has heavy foot traffic on fair weather summer weekends. The largest building in the city, the 216 feet (66 m) Coeur d'Alene Resort Lake Tower is in the city center and the downtown area is of increasing interest to more higher density multi-family apartment and condominium type developments to cope with the growth in housing demand and due to a lack of space and concerns about urban sprawl. Investment in residential and retail development has been intensive along the Interstate 90 corridor and has made Post Falls near the Washington state line become Kootenai County's second largest city. Due to its central location between Spokane and Coeur d'Alene, the city is host to a growing list of retail stores, including a Cabela's and is considered a bedroom community of Spokane. The historic Post Falls Dam surrounding Falls Park on the Spokane River is a local landmark. Hayden is the third largest city in the Coeur d'Alene metro area, and it is known for the eponymous Hayden Lake it almost entirely surrounds. The shores of the lake are filled with summer cabins and large mansions, the most notable being the historic Clark House built in 1912 by F. Lewis Clark; the historic Hayden Lake Country Club lies at the center of the community.


== Government and politics ==

The community operates on a mayor–council government, where the mayor and the six councilors are each elected to four-year terms and the mayor leads the city council meetings that happen on the first and third Tuesday of each month at Coeur d'Alene City Hall. The current mayor is Steve Widmyer. The city is also the county seat of Kootenai County, Idaho.At the state level, The City of Coeur d'Alene is within Idaho Legislative District 2 and Idaho Legislative District 4 for the Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate. At the federal level, Idaho is in Idaho's 1st congressional district and represented by Russ Fulcher in the United States House of Representatives and Mike Crapo and James Risch in the United States Senate.
Coeur d'Alene like the state of Idaho as a whole is known for its conservative politics. In local, state, and federal elections, the city and Kootenai County vote reliably conservative and are sometimes noncompetitive or uncontested. This wasn't always the case and some believe that this increasingly rightward trend is among other things a result of demographic shifts in the county that have altered the political landscape of the community and is a part of a general nationwide ideological polarization trend. North Idaho had once been a largely progressive district that was populated by a significant proportion of union laborers that worked the mines in the Silver Valley that had moderated particularly in the 1980s after mine and mill closures and union busting to then have more competitive elections until the late 20th century. Coeur d'Alene is among a small group of cities in the United States that has elected a socialist mayor, electing John T. Wood, a Socialist Party of America member to office in 1911 on a campaign platform of clean water, better health and sanitation standards, and anti-corruption. Since the high growth period beginning in the 1990s, continuing outmigration of conservatives from the west coast states has made elections in the two-party system less competitive over time as the ever newer residents see the city as a place that represents their social and political values, which are sometimes more conservative than the city as a whole. Many of the new migrants to the state of Idaho came from California, which accounted for over half the net in-migration between 1992 and 2000 and three of the top four counties that had out-migration to Kootenai County were from the birthplace of modern American conservatism in southern California–San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange.


=== Public safety ===
According to the  National Incident Based Reporting System, the Coeur d'Alene metro area (Kootenai County) crime rate per 100,000 population was 4,864 in 2018, which was lower than the Idaho state average of 5,032. The county has a property crime rate of 12.88 and a violent crime rate of 1.59 per 1,000 people in the 2018 Uniform Crime Reports summary, which is lower than the Idaho state average of 14.61 and 2.27 respectively. According to NeighborhoodScout's methodology, the city has a crime index of 24, meaning it is safer than 24 percent of US cities, and has a property and violent crime rate slightly above the Idaho state average but still below the national median in both categories.The Coeur d'Alene Police Department was established in 1887, shortly after Coeur d'Alene was incorporated as a town; one of the first official acts the Board of Trustees took was to appoint a Town Marshal. The police department has 103 police officers (as of September 2020). In addition to the officers on staff, the department has a unique program called Officers Without Legal Standing (OWLS), which consists of retired law enforcement officers of various backgrounds from California who render assistance and aid as unpaid volunteers. Coeur d'Alene and north Idaho has been a favored retirement destination for former California law enforcement for decades, the trend being reported on as early as 1986 by the Los Angeles Times. By the end of the 1990s, the number of retired California police officers in north Idaho numbered over 500, and notably includes former LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman.


== Demographics ==
In 2019, the United States Census Bureau estimated the city's population at 52,414. Coeur d'Alene and its metropolitan area has been combined by the Census Bureau into the Spokane–Coeur d'Alene Combined Statistical Area (CSA) where it is a key component and third largest polity after Spokane and its largest suburb, Spokane Valley. The population of the CSA was 721,928 in 2017. The principal cities in the CSA are separated by suburbs that largely follow the path of Spokane Valley and Rathdrum Prairie. The City of Coeur d'Alene has opted not to voluntarily merge with the Spokane MSA and to remain a distinct metropolitan area. According to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards, cities with employment interchanges between 15 and 25 percent must gain support to combine through local opinion from both communities, otherwise the two MSAs will automatically be combined by the OMB when the employment interchange exceeds 25 percent. Those commuting between Spokane and Kootenai counties for work was 18 percent in 2011.

According to the Association of Religion Data Archives' 2010 Metro Area Membership Report, the denominational affiliations of the Coeur d'Alene MSA (Kootenai County) are 60,657 Evangelical Protestant, 3,064 Mainline Protestant, 7,597 Catholic, 162 Orthodox, 8,492 Other, and 58,522 Unclaimed. Idaho is part of a region called the Unchurched Belt, a region in the Northwestern United States that has historically low rates of religious participation. The evangelical Christian community has been growing with the overall population and there have been instances of whole congregations moving en masse to the area from out of state, especially from California. The evangelical Christian Real Life Ministries church located in Post Falls was the 13th fastest growing church in the nation in 2007.A great deal of the influx of new residents are retirees seeking lower cost of living and traffic; the number of residents aged 65 years and older doubled from 2001 to 2019 according to the Idaho Department of Labor. An Idaho transplant, Richard Butler, a retired engineer from California came to the Coeur d'Alene area due to its low diversity in 1974 to establish a white supremacist church called the Aryan Nations and began preaching. The group went bankrupt and ceased operations in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit after an incident involving the assault of a Native American woman which ended in a $6.3 million judgement and the closure of their Hayden compound. Due to the association with the far right group, Coeur d'Alene and north Idaho has been stereotyped as unwelcoming to minorities, however according to some such as anthropologist and author of Searching for Whitopia, Rich Benjamin, this notion may be oversimplified and misplaced as it may also be an import from California, a state with more fraught and complex race relations. In an interview with the Inlander, Benjamin said "The stereotype is that Idaho is racist. That’s not at all what I found. I was finding that the Californians are importing the racism. Richard Butler was not an Idahoan. Richard Butler was a Californian. And I have no way to prove this, [but] in some ways, the Californians brought their own anxiety and racial tension with them to Idaho."


=== 2010 census ===
As of the 2010 census of 2010, there were 44,137 people, 18,395 households, and 10,813 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,834.7 inhabitants per square mile (1,094.5/km2).

== Economy ==

Historically, the economy of Coeur d'Alene was built and based on mining and logging and the Coeur d'Alene Mining District has been one of the world's most productive mining distrcts. However, after mining and logging diminished in importance in the 1940s, tourism came to be the main influence in the local economy ever since. In 2009, Coeur d'Alene ranked No. 12 on Newsmax magazine's list of the "Top 25 Most Uniquely American Cities and Towns," a piece written by CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg. In determining his ranking, Greenberg commended the city for "embracing its natural beauty and creating a small-business-friendly environment that has helped develop its thriving tourism industry." Giant statues of bird feathers line Northwest Boulevard, celebrating the rich heritage associated with the Coeur d'Alene Tribe. Art galleries and cafes are along Sherman Avenue, Coeur d'Alene's main street. During summer, artists and musicians frequent Sherman Square. Coeur d'Alene's retail has expanded greatly in recent years with the opening of new stores and entertainment venues; the Silver Lake Mall was opened in 1989. Coeur d'Alene's Village at Riverstone development along Northwest Boulevard houses a park, amphitheater, 14-theater Regal Cinemas, a Hampton Inn, condominiums, restaurants, and local retailers.

Coeur d'Alene is the healthcare, educational, media, manufacturing, retail and recreation center for north Idaho. The city has become a major tourist attraction, being at the heart of north Idaho's scenic Lake Country where water sports and activities like wake boarding,  paddleboarding, sailing, parasailing, kayaking, jet skiing, fishing and other lake recreation is popular. In addition to the natural attractions like the Coeur d'Alene City Park and Beach, McEuen Park, and Tubbs Hill, the Coeur d'alene area has two major resorts on the lake, the Coeur d'Alene Resort and the WorldMark Arrow Point resort directly across the lake in Harrison, as well as the Coeur d'Alene Casino in Worley, and the Pacific Northwest's  largest theme park in the Silverwood Theme Park in Athol. There are three major ski resorts within a short driving distance, Silver Mountain Resort in Kellogg, Lookout Pass Ski and Recreation Area at Lookout Pass near Mullan, and Schweitzer Mountain Ski Resort in Sandpoint. Tourism is the main driver of growth in the community and tourism and hospitality related jobs employed over 10,000 people in north Idaho in 2010.Companies that have their head offices in Coeur d'Alene include mining company and owner of the Lucky Friday mine in Mullan, Hecla Mining and the U.S. operations of Canada-based restaurant, Pita Pit.

Commuting across the state line into Washington is not uncommon. A concern for the city however is that the rising minimum wage and salary differential between Washington and Idaho will cause local personnel shortages.

== Infrastructure ==


=== Transportation ===


==== Roads and highways ====

In Coeur d'Alene, the city roads are oriented in the four cardinal directions, with roads going north–south being designated as "streets" and roads going east–west as "avenues". Sherman Avenue divides the streets into north and south and Government Way divides the avenues into east and west. Major east-west thoroughfares include Sherman Avenue and Harrison Avenue and major north–south thoroughfares include U.S. Route 95, Government Way, 15th Street, and Ramsey Street. Coeur d'Alene is accessed from Interstate 90 at Exits 11 through 15. Not too far to the east on I-90 is the Fourth of July Pass and further east near the Montana border is Lookout Pass that traverse the Rocky Mountains near Mullan. Before the construction of I-90, the city was served by U.S. Route 10, which ran through downtown; this route is now Northwest Boulevard and Sherman Avenue. The former US 10, between I-90 exits 11 and 15, is now designated as Interstate 90 Business. Interstate 90 was completed on October 14, 1960 and dedicated by Governor Robert E. Smylie ten days later as the states first major interstate highway project to be completed. Major state highways in the area include Idaho State Highway 41 and U.S. 95. Idaho State Highway 41 has its southern terminus in Post Falls and is routed from I-90 northward to the Newport, Washington area, where it is in the vicinity of U.S. Route 2 and Washington State Route 20 and U.S. 95 runs north to south across the whole of western Idaho, connecting the city with Sandpoint to the north and Moscow and Lewiston and eventually Boise to the south. Originally an exclusively in-state highway when it was proposed by the United States Numbered Highway System in 1925, spanning from the Canadian border to Payette, it is significant for connecting the long disconnected northern panhandle to the rest of the state; prior to the construction of U.S. 95, one would have to travel through Washington and Oregon for passage to avoid the mountainous topography. Lincoln Way is designated U.S. 95 through the Coeur d'Alene area where it is an arterial street serving the suburbs to the north.
The greater Coeur d'Alene area is almost entirely dependent upon private automobiles for transportation, the city has a Walk Score of 36, indicating most errands require a car. Combined with the city's rapid growth since 1990, relative congestion now occurs on a significant portion of the area highways, notably U.S. 95 between Northwest Blvd. north to Hayden. The average commute to work is 18.5 minutes.


==== Public transportation ====

Public transportation played a significant role in Coeur d'Alenes' early growth as a tourist destination. When an interurban electric railroad line was completed in 1903 from Spokane to the city, Inland Northwest residents often flocked to Lake Coeur d'Alene to enjoy being on the lake and going on steamboat cruises and other activities. The interurban electric line would later become the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad. The steamboats on Lake Coeur d'Alene were not only used to transport goods such as ore and timber, but also people. More steamboats operated on Lake Coeur d'Alene than on any other lake west of the Great Lakes and there were intense rivalries between the steamboat lines. The electric railroad and steam navigation on Lake Coeur d'Alene lasted until the late 1930s.[c]Today, free public bus service is available to area residents, provided by Citylink. Citylink buses operate in the urbanized area of Kootenai County, leaving the Riverstone Transfer Station main hub every sixty minutes, seven days a week, including holidays. Buses are wheelchair-accessible and can transport up to two bicycles. The bus system comprises four separate routes:
Urban Route B which serves Post Falls, Hayden and West Coeur d'Alene, Urban Route C which serves Downtown Coeur d'Alene, Fernan and Hayden, Rural Route, which serves the towns of Worley, Plummer, Tensed, and De Smet; and the Link Route, which connects the two transfer stations at Riverstone and Worley. Extension of Spokane Transit Authority service into Idaho, mainly an hourly express bus to and from Coeur d'Alene, was originally proposed as part of the 2015 "STA Moving Forward" ballot measure, the ballot measure eventually passed and service is expected to commence in 2025.


==== Airports ====

The closest major airport serving Coeur d'Alene and North Idaho is Spokane International Airport, which is served by six airlines and is 40 miles (64 km) to the west in Spokane, Washington. The Coeur d'Alene Airport – Pappy Boyington Field (KCOE) serves as a general aviation airport in Hayden, north of the city near U.S. 95. In 1941, the Coeur d'Alene Chamber of Commerce promoted the purchase of 720 acres (290 ha) of land on the Rathdrum Prairie for the runway. The facility was built in 1942 by the Army Corps of Engineers at a cost of over $400,000. The Coeur d'Alene airport was designated as an alternate airport to Weeks Field (now the site of the Kootenai County Fairgrounds) in the event of an Axis invasion; the Weeks Field airport was used to train pilots during World War II.Near the marina on Lake Coeur d'Alene is the Brooks Seaplane Base, which is a city-owned, public-use seaplane base that is used for general aviation, mostly air taxi purposes to conduct tours of Lake Coeur d'Alene and Lake Pend Orielle.

== Notes ==
^[a] Lewis and Clark noted the likely first contact between the Coeur d'Alene people and European Americans in a trade encounter at a Nez Perce camp on their expedition in 1805; along with trade goods, the trappers unwittingly brought diseases that decimated the native population by about 80 percent.^[b] The U.S. government decided to close Fort Sherman and build Fort George Wright in Spokane in part due to the persistent flooding of the banks on Lake Coeur d'Alene.^[c] The popularity and convenience of the automobile and better road infrastructure led to the decline in other modes of transportation. Some steamboats were deliberately set ablaze for 4th of July celebrations in the late 1930s.
