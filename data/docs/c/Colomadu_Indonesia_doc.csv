== History ==
Administratively, Soker Toll Road with a total length of 177.12 km comprise two segments, segment Solo–Mantingan–Ngawi and segment Ngawi–Kertosono. The length of Solo–Mantingan–Ngawi toll road is 90.1 kilometer, while the length of Ngawi–Kertosono is 87.02 kilometer. Hence, in the beginning, Soker Toll Road was designed as two separate toll roads. However, during its tender process, no investors showed interest in bidding these two toll roads except one bidder, which is PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia. On June 28, 2011, Toll Road Concession Agreement (PPJT) amendment has been signed in Jakarta. With this concession agreement, segment Solo-Mantingan-Ngawi will be under PT Solo–Ngawi Jaya, while segment Ngawi-Kertosono will be under PT Ngawi–Kertosono Jaya. Both of this companies are subsidiaries of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia. Since both of toll road concessions have been awarded to the same company, these two toll roads usually are referred as Solo–Kertosono Toll Road, or Soker Toll Road. Construction started in 2012 and the company aimed to finish the project in 2014, but the company was only able to acquire 80 percent of the needed land. The construction has been left idle due to financing and land clearing difficulties. Then State-run toll road operator Jasa Marga and state-owned construction company Waskita Karya taken over from Thiess Contractors in 2015, with about Rp 439 billion (US$34.15 million). Jasa Marga now owns 60 percent of the shares in the project, while Waskita Karya owns the remaining 40 percent.
