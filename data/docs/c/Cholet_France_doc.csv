The town owes the rise of its prosperity to the settlement of weavers there by Édouard Charles Victurnien Colbert, count of Maulévrier, a brother of the great Jean-Baptiste Colbert. It then became an estate of Gabriel-François de Rougé and marquess of Cholet, who developed the town and its economy. The main commercial mall being built this year is named after him: The "Arcades Rougé".
During the early years of the French revolutionary wars, the town found itself at the heart of the counter-revolutionary struggle in the Vendée, culminating in October 1793 with the Battle of Cholet which was won by the republicans and followed by a period of brutal government repression.
