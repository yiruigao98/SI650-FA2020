Castel Maggiore (Bolognese: Castèl Mażåur) is an Italian comune  in the Metropolitan City of Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, central Italy, located 9 kilometres (6 mi) north of the centre of Bologna. Literally, its name means Great Castle, but the name is derived from the earlier name Castaniolo Maggiore.


== History ==
The first documents conveying the existence of the Comune, in ancient times called Castaniolo (meaning "Little chestnut") date back to the 10th century. The legend narrates that the name comes from a big chestnut trunk that should have floated into the territory of the comune through the Canale Navile (a navigable drain canal).
Afterwards Castaniolo was marked by the nickname of Maggiore (Major) in order to distinguish it from a homonymous hamlet (now Castaniolo Minore) of the comune of Bentivoglio.
The name was changed into the one it still carries nowadays during Napoleon's era, in 1818, in which jurisdiction on today's hamlets has been recognised.
The town underwent heavy bomb attacks during World War II because of the passage of the railroad linking Bologna and Padua.
