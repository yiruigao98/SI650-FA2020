== History ==
The name crève cœur (French pronunciation: ​[krɛv kœʁ], heartbreak) is said to derive from Creve Coeur Lake.  According to the city's website the tale goes that the lake "formed itself into a broken heart" after an Indian princess's unrequited love for a French fur trapper led her to jump "from a ledge overlooking" the lake.Written accounts and archaeological finds show that Native Americans inhabited the Creve Coeur area from 9500 B.C. to 1800 A.D. French explorers began farming and fishing in the area in the early 18th century, and fur trappers settled there in the early 19th century.  When the area was acquired by the United States through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Lewis and Clark Expedition came through Creve Coeur. During the American Civil War, men from the area served on both sides of the conflict, but most residents were southern sympathizers.Creve Coeur was incorporated in 1949.  Although there are cabins that are more than 200 years old (including two still in Conway Park) in the community, it grew primarily as a stopping point along Olive Boulevard (now Route 340) between University City and Creve Coeur Lake.  It expanded faster following construction of Interstate 270 and U.S. Route 40.The lake and its associated park of the same name, which was the first county park in St. Louis County, is now part of Maryland Heights to the north of Creve Coeur.
