Câmpia Turzii (Romanian pronunciation: [kɨmˌpi.a ˈturzij]; German: Jerischmarkt; Hungarian: Aranyosgyéres) is a municipality in Cluj County, Transylvania, Romania, which was formed in 1925 by the union of two villages, Ghiriș (Aranyosgyéres) and Sâncrai (Szentkirály). It was declared a town in 1950 and a city in 1998.
The village of Sâncrai was mentioned in a 1219 document as "villa Sancti Regis" ("village of Holy King"), while Ghiriș was first documented in 1292 as "Terra Gerusteleke" ("Gerusteleke", literally meaning "plot of Gerus" in Hungarian).
Michael the Brave was murdered by agents of Giorgio Basta at the current location of Câmpia Turzii on August 9, 1601.
Câmpia Turzii is the "city of adoption" of Toulouse and a sister city of Siemianowice Śląskie.
