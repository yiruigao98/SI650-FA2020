Chachapoyas (Spanish pronunciation: [tʃa.tʃaˈpo.ʝas]) is a city in northern Peru at an elevation of 2,335 meters (7,661 ft). The city has a population of 32,026 people (2017). Situated in the mountains far from the Peruvian coast, Chachapoyas remains fairly isolated from other regions of Peru. It is served by buses to Chiclayo and Cajamarca, and flights to domestic locations from Chachapoyas Airport.
The city of Chachapoyas is the capital of the Amazonas Region. It was founded on September 5, 1538 by the Spanish conquistador Alonso de Alvarado "and his twenty". Local agriculture includes sugar cane, orchid and coffee growing. Chachapoyas' transitional location between the arid Cordillera Occidental and Cordillera Central and the rainy, rainforested Cordillera Oriental, allow it to receive generally moderate annual precipitation without experiencing the copiously excessive, tropical-rainforest-like precipitation amounts in towns farther east such as Moyobamba.


== History ==
Named San Juan de la Frontera de los Chachapoyas, the city was first established near La Jalca, and then near Levanto.  The city's original locations were abandoned due to climate, disease and a lack of defenses against rebelling local groups. The location of the city changed several times, until it was settled in the place that it now occupies at 2334 m. At first the date of settlement had not been specified. It is believed that the Spanish colonials moved the city to its present location in 1545.
The city still preserves its wide colonial casonas of big courts and lounges, with roofs made of tiles. Its Plaza de Armas is located to the west of the city and it is a perfect quadrilateral of 100 m. per side. Located on the south side of the plaza is a monument to the "Hero of Arica", colonel Francisco Bolognesi.
From the viceroyalty period dates the legend that the Indian chief Pantoja asked the viceroy for permission to put a gold roof in his house. This and other treasures would be hidden in one of the 40 caves that surround the city.At one time there was a lagoon surrounded with totoras (a type of bulrush) and palm trees. From these plants, wood was extracted to build the temples of the city. The Kuélap stadium now stands this location.


== Geography ==
From the route of Bagua towards the Mayo River and Huallaga Central, a branch detaches itself, following the course of the Utcubamba River and leading to Chachapoyas.
The city's geographical location has determined its isolation until recently, when better roads were constructed between Chachapoyas and the cities of the northern Peruvian coast. Chachapoyas is surrounded by extensive and matted wooded formations. During the rainy season, these formations are covered with a thick haze, from which the city's name may be derived (from the Quechua word: sachapuyos, meaning "mount of haze"). Another interpretation of the name Chachapoyas is the one that alludes its meaning of "strong male"..
