It is located in the grasslands and lowest marsh, moist and fertile in the Ecuadorian coast, the third most populous canton of Manabi Province and one of the most extensive in the coastal region and the country. The history of this village is also planned in the revolutionary and rebellious sentiment of its inhabitants, having been one of the first cities in Ecuador that led to one of the symbolic-armed conflict highlights. Among these conflicts are the Battle of The Yellows on 1 May 1895, with Chone Liberal Proclamation which was conducted May 5, 1895, motivated and due to the political maneuvering of the then Governor of the province of Guayas, former President Jose Maria Placido Caamano with the sale of the National Flag which caused the Liberal Revolution in Ecuador immediately ignoring government of President Dr.Luis Cordero Crespo and publicly proclaimed leader of the highest office of State Gen. Don Eloy Alfaro Delgado as President of the Republic. 
One month after the events in Chone, with much overlap in Guayaquil, 5 June that same year proclaimed himself President at General Alfaro. Maneuver that historians attribute the first fruits of the liberal revolution and the beginning of an uprising in Manabi to the courage of local peasants and warriors montoneros of Chone. This story is also cited in some stanzas of the Ode to Chone, a tireless struggle to endure then by the following Governments with social unrest and economic disaster for the sector. Chone is also known as La Ciudad de los Naranjos in Florida due to the abundance of crops of Orange and the exquisite taste of its fruits, as well as the production of their crops mentioned. It can appoint as Cocoa Supernova, since the product originates in the area is characterized by excellent quality, authentic flavor and a pleasant aroma and palate of choice for the world, which turned into a modern Chone welcoming place for trade and commodities businesses deriving at a domestic production engine.
Chone City is also known as the Garden of beautiful women and brave men, alluding to the character of the Indians who inhabited this area and the purity of the mixed race (when the Spanish arrived and Europeans on the site) that gave beautiful attractive features to its inhabitants, especially women. Other symbolic allegories have emerged, such as Athens or Florentina Manabi Ecuador, as it was one of the cities with the highest cultural life since the late nineteenth century, as happened Fever by Pepa de Oro in the world. The first indication of the existence of Chone fifteenth century when they settled the tribes of the nausea and Chonanas in places scattered around sites in the tributaries of the Rio Chone called today and its estuary. He comes to understand that the words in the Central American Indians were imported by the first inhabitants due to the commercial relationship they maintained and characterized the repeated use of the CH in their dialects and languages.
When the Spanish in the mid sixteenth century came to know of the existence of nomadic tribes in those parts of the river that came to the Bay of faces, proceeded to call it as a hamlet or Lordship of Indo-Hispanic Pechance, because the area had live acts spread of homes and because they so called themselves Indians and other residents who lived in the present territory of Chone. Spanish chroniclers of mid-sixteenth century spoke of the great river that was to lead a league in a splendid bay, where they could fit quietly and establish marine craft and boats. The year 2008 is the third city of Manabi in population and economy. Canton purely agricultural and livestock production, has the largest number of cattle in Ecuador. The City is surrounded by hills and slopes are small systems of coastal elevations with heights in excess of 100 meters above sea level. The village is located in a valley crossed by the Rio Chone being the largest watershed in the province.
This canton is dynamic, hospitable and is home to beautiful women and men responsible aspiration being deployed in academic instruction. According to unofficial data set for the public, as a parish church, was founded on 7 August 1735, by the religious portovejense Fray José Antonio Cedeño and Macias, and named as Villa de San Cayetano de Chone or officially named Hispanic La Villa Rica Real Holy Order of the Blessed San Cayetano de Chone desta Our New Castile, because the city was founded not only on behalf of the saint but also inherits the titration manifesto The Royal Viceroy knew characterize the protection small towns to take with them before their official name always precedes a prefix that connects with the City of Los Reyes, which was the seat of the Viceroyalty of Peru. On 7 August, this date is understood not as Spanish foundation parroquialización, because this political-religious maneuvering was one step from the famous Bourbon Reforms headed by the reign of Philip V of Spain.
The aim of the Bourbon Reforms was to define the accuracy of vast unexplored territories of the Spanish crown in the American colonies overseas, in the limited areas of each estate, mainly in the sparsely appointed interior of Atacama, where Chone part of its jurisdiction administrative policy in the Royal Audience of Quito. The latter was dependent on the government with serious demographic problems of supply and public administration, i.e., that these territories depended chonenses Atacames legally and geographically, but politically Quito. Spanish Foundation of Canton Chone came at a time when the supremacy of western European culture was thriving social entertainment, being the highest authority of this land was then the Viceroy of Peru XXVIII Don Jose de Armendariz and Perurena, Prime Castelfuerte Marquis. 
The foundation date on the Catholic calendar coincides with the anniversary of the death of San Cayetano de Thiene, the saint of workers. It is very important to add that the territory which contains the principal city of Chone, rises in the terrain that is surrounded by rugged mountains and swampy jungle that eventually ascends along the infrastructure of buildings and houses built on small city. In other words, urban design is intertwined in the middle and along a small semicircle of mountains with lush vegetation and exotic ancient, possibly on the moon. This vegetation covers only the cardinal directions from the northeast to the southeast in relation to the situation of demographic expansion in Canton, then forming the legitimate Chone semicircle Lunar mountain which rises in these characteristics and definitions. Today is a real virtue of the city geographically, suggesting the famous and notable antihipótesis and Spanish custom of founding cities near mountain ranges and adjacent shores or limiting the placement of the nomadic tribes in the area.
Chone is definitely a move over the Spanish conquest in the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito and planned since the existence of tribes and civilizations that inhabited the area by the fifteenth century, but states that the current location of the city is due to decisions that chose to promote the indigenous, but not Spanish delegations that were by small indigenous settlements. But it is clear that the current city was established here because of the presence of the river that served as a channel and market penetration, showing signs of economic improvement in Cocoa Boom of the late nineteenth century, where Chone became a city recognized for the quality of this popular fruit of exotic origin. Physically, the lunar crescent Chone mountain is a natural phenomenon that is understood by the elevation of a group of mountains that form a single circular chain around the city at the cardinal points already mentioned. It can be clearly seen from the bridge that extends in a diagonal road towards the monument to the Liberal Proclaims June 5, 1895 in the site which is known today as the banners on the road just leads to the parishes of San Antonio and the cantons of San Vicente, Sucre, Tosagua, Rocafuerte and Portoviejo. Perhaps the Spanish only be undertaken on track layout and request that the Indians showed them to found the city is located today, citing Guayas Hill is part of the semicircular or lunar chain surrounding the city in full point cardinal East, where the main urban area is defined. To the urban and rural development Chone rightful economic organization of the City from Cocoa Boom in the late nineteenth century and its Cantonización on 24 July 1894, apart from the events that were undertaken subsequently.
Scientific studies and anonymous certain educational institutions like the now-defunct Canton Reforestation Program The Educational Center Bejucal (Parish of St. Rita) argue that the northern Manabi territory includes some of the lowest in the Andean atmosphere, but that characterize the strong presence of fertile and productive contributors oxygen and forest resources for the planet. This area has a wealth of endemic and exotic flora of Ecuador, which would consider that the contribution of Chone forest remains at a significant level by the abundance of land and vegetation contributors to the improvement and cleaning of the ecosystems of the Province Manabi and country. Chone is complemented by its eastern neighbors: Flavio Alfaro and Carmen, which also promote business and agriculture and livestock generating the wealth of the territory where their cities were settled, as these cantons in the past were part of the jurisdiction of Chone until the decade of 60 and 80 respectively.
Around town chonense mountains and hills rise to 500 meters swamp forming a single high mountains around the city where most of the limitations of the compass. The Pacific Ocean Cedeño Mendoza writer says: "All the Canton Chone, far and wide, tinged with gentle hills that give origin to endless streams or creeks that flow into marshes or barricades or in one of five major rivers that born in their land: Chone Quininde, Jama, Canuto Grande and the Rio de Oro Daule tributary. The mountain resembles a small stream or micro extraction of the Western Cordillera of the Andes. On the west side and northwest of the city is surrounded by three terraqua elevations which are defined as three hills, and the greatest of these is located in the middle forming the popular tourist lookout Cerro Guayas, where is built the statue of Christ the Redeemer of Chone.
