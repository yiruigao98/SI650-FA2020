Batang is said to be the root word of Batangan, the former name of the capital city and the province.Another legend states that a statue of the Holy Infant Jesus on board a Spanish ship en route from Manila to Cebu sought shelter on the coast of city after its voyage was interrupted by a bad weather. The crewmen took the Holy Infant to a small church near the river and sang the Te Deum hymn. The storm miraculously stopped and the ship resumed its trip to Cebu. Soon, the statue was reported missing. At the same time, a deaf-mute boy who was playing along the river found the statue atop a floating log.
