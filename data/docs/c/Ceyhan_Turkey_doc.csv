Ceyhan (pronounced [ˈdʒejhan]) is a city and a district in the Adana Province, in southern Turkey, 43 km (27 mi) east of Adana. With a population of over 157,000, it is the largest district of the province, outside the city of Adana. Ceyhan is the transportation hub for Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Russian oil and natural gas. The city is situated on the Ceyhan River that flows through Çukurova plain. The Ceyhan River is dammed at Aslantas to provide flood control and irrigation for the lower river basin around Ceyhan.


== Economy ==
Ceyhan's marine transport terminal is the Mediterranean terminus of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (the "BTC") which brings crude oil from the landlocked Caspian Sea across Azerbaijan and Georgia, and entering Turkey in the northeast. The pipeline was completed in May 2005.  The terminal contains seven storage tanks, a jetty capable of loading two tankers of up to 300,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT) simultaneously, metering facilities, a waste water treatment plant and vapor incineration  ("burn-off") facilities.
Ceyhan Terminal is also the destination of Kirkuk-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline and planned Samsun-Ceyhan by-pass pipeline. In future Ceyhan will be also a natural gas hub for a planned pipeline constructed parallel to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and for a planned extension of the Blue Stream Gas Pipeline from Samsun to Ceyhan.
Set to become a crossroad in the near future, Ceyhan's significance in political terms is also expected to rise considerably, as stressed during an early 2006 symposium organized by the municipality.
