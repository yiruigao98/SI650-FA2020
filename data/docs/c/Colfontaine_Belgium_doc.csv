This is a list of hospitals and hospital networks in Belgium as of August 2019, sorted per region and per province. For each hospital or hospital network, the list includes if applicable their specialisation, the municipalities where they are located, any international hospital accreditation they have obtained as well as their number of hospital beds (an indicator of the overall size and importance of the hospital or network). Note that in Dutch a hospital is called ziekenhuis, kliniek or hospitaal, whilst in French a hospital is called hôpital, centre hospitalier or clinique. Some common abbreviations in this list are:

'AZ' indicates a general hospital (Dutch: Algemeen Ziekenhuis).
'UZ' indicates a university hospital (Dutch: Universitair Ziekenhuis), as does 'CHU' (French: Centre Hospitalier Universitaire).
'CHR' indicates a regional hospital, mostly found in larger towns and cities and their metropolitan area (French: Centre Hospitalier Régional), as does 'RZ' (Dutch: Regionaal Ziekenhuis).
'PZ' or 'PC' indicates a psychiatric hospital (Dutch: Psychiatrisch Ziekenhuis or Psychiatrisch Centrum), as does 'HP', 'CP' or 'CHP' (French: Hôpital Psychiatrique, Centre Psychiatrique or Centre Hospitalier Psychiatrique).
'UPC' indicates a psychiatric hospital associated with a university or a psychiatric division of a university hospital (Dutch: Universitair Psychiatrisch Centrum).

== Brussels-Capital Region ==
Due to the its bilingual nature, hospitals in the Brussels-Capital Region can be either monolingual Dutch, monolingual French or bilingual depending on their nature. University hospitals belong to one of the two linguistic communities and are therefore monolingual Dutch or French by law. Other public hospitals managed by a public authority have to be bilingual by law. Private hospitals not managed by a public authority are legally not bound to either language, but most cater to both. However, all hospital emergency services in the Brussels-Capital Region (no matter if they're part of a public or private hospital) are required to be bilingual, since patients transported by emergency ambulance do not have a free choice to which hospital they will be brought. Mind that this is only the de iure situation, de facto are some hospitals that are legally required to be bilingual seriously lacking in personnel that's proficient in the other language. This list indicates whether hospitals or hospital networks are officially monolingual or bilingual. The name of the bilingual hospitals is also given in the two languages.Additionally, hospitals where younger members of the Belgian royal family were born are indicated with an asterisk (*).
