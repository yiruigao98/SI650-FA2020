== History ==


=== Ancient Age ===
Prehistorical settlements discovered by archaeologists show us that people used to live in Civitanova since Palaeolithic. Civitanova was founded probably around the 8th century BC as Cluana by the Piceni Italic tribe, at the mouth of the Chienti river. The Romans captured it in 268 BC, and, in 50 AD, founded a new settlement, Cluentis Vicus (the current frazione of Civitanova Alta) on a hill near the sea. During the Migration Period, old Cluana was destroyed by the Visigoths and much of the population took refuge in the Vicus.


=== Middle Ages ===
Cluentis Vicus is mentioned in 1009 as Civitate Nova, Civitas Nova, Civitatem Novam e Nova Civitas. People go live near the coast, on the San Marone hill, where there is a memorial dedicated to the martyr San Marone protector of Civitanova.
With the arrival of the Franks, Cluentis Vicus became a feudal town. In 1075, the Aldonesi family (or Aldonensi), together with the bishop of Fermo Pietro I, guaranteed the defense of the city. The it was under the da Varano, Malatesta, Sforza and Visconti.


=== Modern Age ===
In 1440, under Francesco Sforza, a new line of walls was built (called "Scarpata", or "Escarpment"), while a fortress was built to protect the port (the current communal palace "Cesarini-Sforza" was built on its remains). The city, attacked by Turk pirates, riven by internal feuds and by the plague, started to decay from the 16th century.
In 1551 pope Julius III (born in Grottammare, not far from Civitanova) named Cesarini a Duke. In 1674 the family took the name Cesarini–Sforza,  following the marriage between Livia Cesarini and Federico Sforza of Santa Fiora. This event began a period of renewal: a new wall for the "Città Alta" was built, as well as new roads and palaces.
During the 17th and the 18th centuries, the "Città Alta" was renovated, the main square was expanded and the church of San Paolo was built, while the civic tower was substituted by the clock tower.
The port was expanded, giving rise to another small town. In 1782 Civitanova had 6057 inhabitants, of whom 5717 lived in  Città Alta,  65 in San Marone and 275 at the port.


=== Contemporary Age ===
On 12 December 1828, pope Leo XII conceded the title of City to the two towns, Civitanova Alta and Civitanova Porto. In 1833 the city had 8,400 inhabitants.
In 1841 construction began on the port's first church, Saint Paul, which was completed in 1853.
In 1913 the Civitanova Porto district was established as an independent municipality and in 1938 Civitanova Porto e Civitanova Alta were united under the name of Civitanova Marche.
Following nearby industrial development, Civitanova Porto became a popular location for summer resorts lived by the noble families of the hinterland. Count Pieralberto Conti (1923) built a racecourse and, in 1910, a house in Liberty style. The city developed into a popular vacation centre.
