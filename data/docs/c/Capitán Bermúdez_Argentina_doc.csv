The town was founded in 1889, and officially became a city in 1971. Its name is an homage to Justo Bermúdez, a captain of the rebel forces of General José de San Martín during the Battle of San Lorenzo.
The city hosts important industries that make use of environmentally harmful chemicals, including a petrochemical plant and a paper mill. According to studies conducted in the 1990s by Greenpeace, the paper plant (property of Celulosa S. A.) is responsible for contaminating the Paraná River with chlorine-derived chemicals and others (methoxyphenols such as chloro-guaiacol, di- and tri-chloro-phenols, alkylbenzenes, sulfur compounds, long-chain hydrocarbons, and chloroform). Similar charges have been made about the petrochemical plant Electroclor, owned by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), which manufactures chlorine.In 1991, fragments of the Soviet Union's Salyut 7 space station showered the town after burning up on re-entry. It had overshot its intended entry point, which would have placed its debris in uninhabited portions of the southern Pacific Ocean.
