== History ==

Pyotr Beketov's Cossacks founded Chita in 1653.After 1825, several of the Decembrists suffered exile to Chita.According to George Kennan, "Among the exiles in Chita were some of the brightest, most cultivated, most sympathetic men and women that we had met in Eastern Siberia."When Richard Maack visited the city in 1855, he saw a wooden town, with one, also wooden, church. He estimated Chita's population at under 1,000, but predicted that the city would soon experience fast growth, due to the upcoming annexation of the Amur valley by Russia.By 1885, Chita's population had reached 5,728, and by 1897 it increased to 11,500.During the Russian revolution of 1905, the Chita Republic was declared. Government forces took control again in January 1906.
In 1945, Puyi, the last Emperor of China, and some of his associates were held prisoner in the city, in a former sanatorium for officers.
