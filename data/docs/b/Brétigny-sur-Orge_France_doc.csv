Brétigny-sur-Orge (pronounced [bʁe.ti.ɲi.syʁ.ɔʁʒ]) is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France, 26.7 km (16.6 mi) from the city center.


== Origin of the city name ==
Britiniacum in 1146, Bretigniacum en 1548, Breteigny.
Origins of Brétigny starts at the Gaul Roman era. The etymology comes from the Latin « britiniacum » which means «property of the breton ». The name certifies that this territory was during that period dedicated to a Breton, coming from the Brittany island (the Great Britain of today), during the Brittany migration period  (6th century). Brétigny belongs to the royal estate of the Merovingian kings (from the 5th century until the 8th century).
During the commune creation, the city name was spelled without any accent. This accent was added in 1801 and the name of the river ("on Orge") was added in 1898.
