The origin of the suburb name is from the Kabi Aboriginal dialect meaning frilled lizard.The first large-scale cotton crops in Queensland were grown at Booval in the 1860s.In December 1895 the Anglican Diocese's architect John Buckeridge called for tenders to erect the Church of All Saints in Bundanba (as Bundamba was then known) on land donated by Miss Ferrett and Mr Harry Ferrett. Bishop William Webber laid the foundation stone on Friday 24 January 1896. Bishop Webber opened and dedicated the new church on Saturday 16 May 1896. In April 1897 Harry Ferrett was married in the church. In 1913 the church building was moved by rolling it on beer barrels to Silkstone.
