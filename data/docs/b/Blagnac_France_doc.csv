Toulouse–Blagnac Airport (French: Aéroport de Toulouse–Blagnac) (IATA: TLS, ICAO: LFBO) is an international airport located 3.6 nautical miles (6.7 km; 4.1 mi) west northwest of Toulouse, partially in Blagnac, both communes of the Haute-Garonne department in the Occitanie region of France. In 2017, the airport served 9,264,611 passengers. As of April 2017, the airport features flights to 74 destinations mostly in Europe and Northern Africa with a few additional seasonal long-haul connections.


== Facilities ==

The airport resides at an elevation of 499 feet (152 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt-paved runways: 14R/32L is 3,500 by 45 metres (11,483 ft × 148 ft) and 14L/32R is 3,000 by 45 metres (9,843 ft × 148 ft). Both Airbus and ATR manufacture aircraft at nearby facilities and test them from the airport. A Concorde formerly operated by Air France with the registration F-BVFC is preserved at the Aeroscopia Museum near the airport. Airbus and ATR utilize runway 32L/14R for flight testing and delivery flights, while runway 32R/14L is used by commercial flights coming in to Toulouse (Airbus also uses this runway for formation flights). Also, the Airbus Delivery Center is on the runway 32L/14R side.

Toulouse–Blagnac Airport SA is a limited liability company; the share capital is €148,000, and its shareholders are the French government (60%), the Toulouse Chamber of Commerce and Industry (25%), the Regional Council (5%), the Departmental Council (5%), and the Urban Area (5%). Toulouse–Blagnac Airport SA has authority to operate the airport until 2046 under a franchise agreement awarded by the French government. The current CEO is Philippe Crébassa.

== Access ==


=== Tram ===
Since April 2015, the tram line T2 connects Toulouse with the airport every 15 minutes. The tram connects with metro ligne A at Arènes and metro ligne B at Palais de Justice. It takes about 35 minutes with a change to go to the town center by tram.


=== Bus and coach ===
Shuttle buses to Toulouse city centre stop outside Hall B every 20 minutes. Faster than the tram, they take approximately 20 minutes to reach the city centre, stopping at Compans-Caffarelli and Jeanne d'Arc (both on Metro Line B), Jean Jaurès (Metro Line A and B) and at Toulouse-Matabiau railway station. Three daily coach services connect Toulouse–Blagnac Airport to Andorra, which does not have its own commercial airport.


== Accidents and incidents ==
On 29 January 1988, Inter Cargo Service Flight 1004, operated by Vickers Vanguard F-GEJF, crashed when take-off was attempted with only three fully operable engines.
On 30 June 1994, an Airbus A330-300 performing a test flight crashed shortly after takeoff, due to a series of mistakes while conducting a flight test simulating an engine failure. All seven people on board died in the accident.
On 15 November 2007, a brand-new Airbus A340-600 due to be delivered to Etihad Airways ran up and over the top of a concrete sloped blast-deflection wall during an engine test at the Airbus factory at the airport. This was due to the crew not following proper test procedures, raising all four engines to maximum thrust while the wheels were un-chocked. The attempt to steer away from the wall resulted in decreased braking power. Five people were injured and the aircraft was written off.
