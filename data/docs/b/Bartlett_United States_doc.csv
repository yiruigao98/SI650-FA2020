Bartlett, originally called "Union Depot", first served as the last major Tennesseean depot along the westward stagecoach route from Nashville. It later shifted to serve as a rail station after the stagecoach route was replaced by the Memphis & Ohio Railroad. An agricultural community gradually emerged around the depot and subsequent station that saw little growth until after the American Civil War.The community saw quick growth during Reconstruction, and by 1886 was home to a school, two gristmills, three churches, several general stores, and about 300 inhabitants. It had been officially incorporated on November 1, 1866, with a population of less than 100 under the inaugural mayorship of Bryan Wither. The city derived its name from Major Gabriel M. Bartlett, a planter and pioneer settler of the area, whose homeplace was located on the old Raleigh-Somerville Road (Stage Road) at the present location of Bartlett Station Plaza.
