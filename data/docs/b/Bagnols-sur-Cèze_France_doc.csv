A small regional center, Bagnols-sur-Cèze was quite certainly a Roman town (the name of the town comes from the Latin balnearius meaning baths) before the main part was built in the 13th century around a central arcaded square that is still preserved today. At the same period, the regional market was installed here, undoubtedly contributing to its expansion.

Bagnols-sur-Ceze expanded steadily after the Marcoule nuclear center was created in 1956.
