== History ==
Baildon is known to have been inhabited for many centuries; several cup-and-ring stones on Baildon Moor has shown evidence of Bronze Age inhabitation.
Baildon Moor has a number of gritstone outcrops with numerous prehistoric cup and ring marks.
A denuded and mutilated bank represents the remains of an Iron Age settlement known as Soldier's Trench, sometimes mistaken for a Bronze Age stone circle.
A Bronze Age cup-marked rock is incorporated in the bank.Baildon is recorded as Beldone and Beldune in the Domesday Book.
In 1066 it belonged to a Gospatric, son of Arnketil, and had passed to Erneis of Buron by 1086.Baildon had two manor houses: one on Hall Cliffe, the other in lower Baildon.
In the 1960s, the Hall Cliffe house was demolished and replaced with the Ian Clough Hall.
During the Industrial Revolution, Baildon developed a woollen industry; Westgate House was built in 1814 by the Ambler family who were prominent in the wool trade and the warehouse part of the building was Feathers Bakery now Nine Café adjacent to the mill which is now the Westgate Bar.During the 19th and early 20th centuries, conditions in Bradford deteriorated and poverty and ill health became widespread; Baildon began developing as a commuter town along with neighbouring Shipley.
In the latter years of the 20th century, the West Riding suffered from economic decline through the gradual closure of its textile and engineering industries.
Bradford was particularly affected by this; however, Leeds grew as a major administrative and financial centre and Baildon with its railway links to Leeds has become a strategic commuter town.


=== Gypsy parties ===
Baildon was an important location for the British Gypsy community.
A report of 1929 stated that annual Gypsy Parties had started two to three hundred years before – records were said to go back to 1770 when it was reported to be an ancient custom.
In 1881, up to 5,000 people are said to have paid for admission.
Gradually the event was taken over by local residents, who dressed up as Gypsies and formed 'tribes'.
Proceeds went to the local Horticultural Society.
After 1897 the tradition died out, apparently because the 'real Gypsies' had disappeared.
However, in 1929 it was revived to raise funds for Baildon Hospital.
A local resident, John Keen, then contacted the so-called King of the Gypsies, Xavier Petulengro, and they re-established large Gypsy gatherings at Baildon, recorded on Pathe News films and shown nationally in cinemas.
The Gypsy Parties ended with the start of the Second World War and were never revived.
However, in the early 1990s travellers used the Bank Holiday loophole to occupy Shipley Glen in Baildon for a weekend festival.


=== Pleasure Grounds ===

In northern Shipley off Prod Lane there was a small fairground with dodgem cars, booths and a historic "Aerial Glide" suspended roller coaster that for a short period had listed building status.
In earlier years the fairground attractions at Shipley Glen were much more extensive.
The fairground closed and is now dismantled and newly built (2015/6) private housing now covers the site.
The only working remnant of the Pleasure Grounds is the Shipley Glen Cable Tramway a funicular railway carrying passengers from just north of Roberts Park, Saltaire up the hill side through Walker Wood to the location of the Pleasure Grounds at the top of Prod Lane.

HistoryBoards of Guardians were formed as a result of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 though the Baildon Local Board of Guardians was formed in 1852.
Elections were held on 16 September 1852, and their first quorate meeting was on 9 October 1852. The last meeting took place on 18 December 1894.
As a result of the Local Government Act 1894 Baildon became an Urban District on 1 January 1895 and was then administered by Baildon Urban District Council.
Baildon Urban District Council was established in 1895 and was disbanded when Bradford Metropolitan District Council was established in 1974.

Present dayA group of local residents held an open meeting on 7 May 1997 and as a result the Baildon Community Council came into being on 26 June 1997 as a means of communicating local interest to appropriate authorities.
Residents of Baildon went through the appropriate legal process and as a result Baildon Parish Council was formed which held its first full meeting 14 May 2007.
The civil parish does not cover nearby Esholt, part of the Baildon Ward at District level, but includes the area North of the River Aire along Coach Road and Higher Coach Road (Baildon South West) which is within the Shipley Ward at District level.
On Monday 10 June 2013 Baildon officially became a town when Baildon Parish Council resolved that, in accordance with the Local Government Act 1972 s245, the Parish of Baildon shall have the status of a town.
Consequently, the Parish Council was renamed Baildon Town Council.

== Landmarks ==
One of the main monuments in Baildon is the Frances Ferrand memorial fountain, known locally as the 'potted meat stick'.
This was built by Baron Amphlett of Somerset as a memorial to his mother-in-law, Frances Ferrand.
It still stands today to the eastern side of Browgate.
In 1925 the monument was put at threat when plans were produced to replace in with a bus terminus.
In the 1960s the monument was removed and dismantled; however, in 1986 the Mechanics Institute raised funds to take it out of storage and restore it.
To the north of Towngate roundabout in front of Glendale House is a concrete paved open area created in the 1960s containing what remains of the stocks and a sandstone pillar thought to be the remains of a mediaeval cross, both Grade II listed.
On Glen Road on the edge of Baildon Moor, close to Shipley Glen, is Bracken Hall Countryside Centre and Museum, a free-to-visit children's museum, natural history education centre and nature centre.Baildon's War Memorials are situated on Browgate
and in Tong Park.

=== Churches ===
The Church of St. James in Charlestown is a painted tongue and groove timber building, now a grade II listed building.
It was moved to Baildon from Great Warley, Essex in 1905.
The Reverend N. R. Bailey, rector of Great Warley, had property in Baildon and hoped to retire there.
However his obituary was published in November 1900 before he retired.
In 2007/2008 the church was moved again, but only by a few yards.
This allowed the surrounding land to be sold by the Diocese for development.
Rotten timbers were replaced and underground heat pump system installed to make the building more eco-friendly.
The Church of St. John the Evangelist designed by Mallinson & Healey, was built in 1848 though the south tower was not added until 1928.
The east window designed by Powell & Sons was added in 1870.


== Transport ==
The village is served by Baildon railway station on the electrified Wharfedale Line with connections to Bradford Forster Square and Ilkley.
There is however, no service to Leeds owing to its position on the curve between the two lines.
Passengers must instead change at Shipley or the nearby Guiseley (Shipley having more services).
Baildon is served by the West Yorkshire Metro 626, 649, and 656–659 First and Yorkshire Tiger bus services.
The main road through Baildon is the A6038 Otley Road while the B6151 Baildon Road / Brow Gate goes the short distance from Otley Road up to Browgate roundabout.

There were a large number of First and Middle schools in the area, including Fernihurst First School, Tong Park First School, Belmont Middle School & Ladderbanks Middle School, before the 1998 Bradford Education reform which returned the area to a two-tier school system.
Currently, there are four local primary schools: Sandal Primary School to the North on West Lane, Baildon Church of England School to the east off Langley Lane, Hoyle Court Primary school in Charlestown and Glenaire Primary School to the south on Thompson Lane.
The nearest secondary school for the area is Titus Salt School on Higher Coach Road, overlooking Roberts Park, Saltaire. There is dispute as to which town the school actually is in, some classing it as Baildon and some as Saltaire
