Boca Del Mar was a census-designated place (CDP) in an unincorporated area near Boca Raton in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The population was 21,832 at the 2000 census. While it is not officially in the City of Boca Raton, the community is often classified under its umbrella term.
The subdivision was first planned in 1971 as Boca Granada by the Behring Corporation, who previously developed Tamarac Lakes. Ultimately, the name was changed to its current state to avoid confusion of a condo complex in the area, and Leadership Housing, Inc. assumed control after a merger deal. Construction began a year later, and progressed significantly in the 1980s.
