== History ==

A few years after the expulsion of the French, the governor of Rio de Janeiro, Christopher de Barros, gave the captain Belchior Azeredo one sesmaria on the river Sarapuí, in the old village of Jacutingas Indians. There, he founded the Santo Antônio mill Jacutinga, which in the future would be the current municipality of Belford Roxo. A shrine to St. Anthony was built on a hillside 750 meters from the river bank Sarapuí, near the site established for port activities.
At the dawn of the seventeenth century, the Holy mill Antonio Jacutinga was dismembered, appearing then the maxambomba mill (Nova Iguaçu) and the ingenuity of Poce (Tenure). In the eighteenth century, a new break (this time in maxambomba the mill lands) has raised the Caxoeira mill (Mosque), on land that belonged to the governor of Rio de Janeiro Salvador de Sá. For over two hundred years, the land remained, by hereditary succession, under the control of the heirs of Salvador de Sá, the Vasques Correia family.
In the middle of that eighteenth century, the lands of the San Antonio sugar mill again be dismembered for the formation of new devices: the Brejo and Sarapuí. In the same period, the lands of maxambomba ingenuity were dismembered for the formation of Madureira ingenuity.
In 1767, in a topographic map of the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, made by Manuel Vieira Lion, appears clearly in this region the ingenuity of Brejo. Its first occupant was Christopher Mendes Leitão, in 1739.
The Baixada Fluminense is cut by Sarapuí River and was surrounded by marshes and swamps. Had in his bank, a port for flow of production: sugar, rice, beans, corn and brandy.
After a succession of owners in 1815, Father Miguel Arcanjo Leitão, who owned the land and sold them to the first Viscount of Barbacena, Felisberto Caldeira Brant, future Marquis of Barbacena.
In 1843, Peter Brant, the Comte de Iguaçu - son of the first Viscount and Marquis of Barbacena - took over the farm after his father's death, which occurred in the city of Rio de Janeiro on July 13, 1842.
In 1851, Brant Boiler family sold their farm to the Commander Manuel José Coelho da Rocha.
In the second half of the nineteenth century, the estate fell into decay due to the occurrence of epidemics. The laying of tracks for crossing the Rio d'Ouro railway, cutting the farm Heath in 1872 on land donated by the Rock Rabbit descendants, began a movement claiming to turn it on railway line passengers, as previously, this railway was built to capture water in Tinguá saws, Rio d'Ouro and San Pedro, with placement of aqueducts along its margin.
