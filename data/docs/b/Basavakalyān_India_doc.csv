== History ==
Before India's independence, Basavakalyan was called Kalyani. After independence and division of states on linguistic basis in 1956, Kalyana was renamed as BasavaKalyan in memory of Vishwaguru Basavanna, a revolutionary who established Anubhava Mantapa (spiritual democracy) in 12th-century India.

=== Western Chalukyas ===

It was the royal capital of the Western Chalukya (Kalyani Chalukyas) dynasty from 1050 to 1195. Someshvara I (1041–1068) made Kalyana as his capital, recognised as Kalyani Chalukyas to differentiate with Badami Chalukyas. Later ruled by Someshvara II, Vikramaditya VI, Someshvara III, Jagadhekamalla III and Tailapa III. King Someshwara I (1042–1068 CE) moved the capital from Manyakheta (present Malkhed in Kalaburagi district) to Kalyani. During the 10th to 12th centuries he ruled nearly half of India, most of the western Deccan and South India.
King Vikramaditya VI had scholars in his court such as Someshwara, Bilhana (poet of Kashmir) and Vigyaneshwara (legal expert). On 26 February 1077 Coronation of Vikramaditya VI started Chalukya Vikrama Varsha Jalsangi Temple.


==== Kalyani Chalukya architecture ====
The earliest examples of the Kalyani Chalukya style are found at Kuknur. The Kalleshvara and Navalinga temples here bear resemblances to early Chalukya group of Aihole and Pattadkal. The Jaina temple at Lakkundi near Gadag forms the next step in the improvement of this style introducing a greater ornamental effect in the treatment of the surface.
The Kalyani style of architecture reached its maturity and culmination in the 12th century. Kasi Vishveshvara at Lakkundi, Mallikarjuna at Kuruvatti and Mahadeva Temple (Itagi) are the finest examples produced by the later Chalukya architects. The Saraswathi and Someshwara temples at Gadag are in a mutilated condition. There are nearly one hundred monuments of the period, scattered all over the Deccan, giving us information about the artistic excellence attained by the later Chalukyas of Kalyani.
