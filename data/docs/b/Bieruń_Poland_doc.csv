== History ==
The settlement of Berouna was first mentioned in a 1376 deed, when Silesia belonged to the Bohemian Crown. The name is most probably related to the, similarly spelled, Slavic deity Perun, remains of its cultic place still present at nearby Lędziny. John II of Opava, the Přemyslid duke of Racibórz granted it town privileges in 1387. A part of the united Duchy of Opole and Racibórz Bieruń was incorporated by the Habsburg Monarchy in 1532.
With most of Silesia, it was conquered by Prussia in the First Silesian War of 1740–42 and afterwards incorporated into the Silesia Province. On 18 June 1845, a fire destroyed large areas of the village; King Frederick William IV of Prussia personally donated 9000 talers for its reconstruction. It became part of the German Empire in 1871. A cigarette and munitions factory was set up in the village in the mid-19th century. Located near the border with Lesser Poland and Austrian Silesia, Berun until 1919 was the most southeasterly town of Germany.
After the third Silesian Uprising of 1921 and the subsequent Upper Silesia plebiscite (in which 1427 or 82.1% of residents in Alt Berun and 292 or 58.4% of residents in Neuberun voted for Poland), Berun was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic and soon thereafter was officially renamed Bieruń. From 1975 until 1991 it was a district of the neighbouring Tychy municipality.
