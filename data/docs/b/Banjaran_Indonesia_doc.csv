Usually the book the Koran used by clerics and students of the book 'vacancies' in the sense not been given a translation book. The students, especially students beginners, prefer the book the Qur'an which sheets the pages have a wide space that allows them to fill it with meaning taught by the clerics on the sidelines in between existing rows.
Teaching materials is subject to two books of hadith or sunna. This book is a book compiled by the hadith collector that contains all the thoughts, words, actions and models of the Prophet Muhammad. Testimony from people who still had time to sit with the founder of Pondok Pesantren Walibarokah Burengan Banjaran Kediri namely KH Nur Hasan Al Ubaidah said that clerics were mastering Hadith (gives meaning and description) as much as 49 types of Hadith that the set consists of 6 hadith which are usually categorized as kutubussitah (the level of validity is recognized all except the Shiite sect of Islam and some sects that deny the legitimacy of the hadith of the Prophet) and the rest are various hadith complement. The books of hadith kutubussitah consists of a set of hadith compiled by Buchori, Muslim, Ibn Majjah, Abi Daud, Sunan Tirmidhi, and Nasa'i.
In addition to big book of hadiths, also found materials that form the set of books. Book of the set is footage laws or arguments from the Qur'an and Hadith compiled based on the field or specific topic such as Kitabussholah (Book of Prayer), Kitabudda'wat (book collection of prayers), Ilmi Kitaab (book concerning the obligation to learn the science of religion), Imaroh Kitaab (book about the priesthood), and so on.

Text this advice contains advice in the context of actual problems overcome by using the basics of Islamic law is the Qur'an and Hadith. In Islamic law scholar's advice is one of the basic form of Islamic law called consensus or ijtihad.


=== Learning Method ===
In Islam, learning is essentially the process of moving messages from one person to another. Learning methods are used both in boarding school or teaching in the mosques followed by the pilgrims as usual is the method used by the Prophet. So there is a movement of purification in the method of learning. In Islam, since the prophet Muhammad and the caliphs and the companions, the process of moving the messages contained in the Qur'an and Hadith through the method of reading, writing, and listening in science communication is referred to as verbal communication. This is in accordance with the sayings of Prophet Muhammad: 'You hear (the science from me), then you heard by your students and your disciples heard ole pupils' (Hadith Abu Dawud). So the knowledge transfer methods in PPB includes two aspects as well as the verbal communication (oral communication) and written communication (written communication).
Therefore, this method is not applied only in Pondok Pesantren Walibarokah Burengan Banjaran Kediri but also throughout the cabin LDII the ordinary worshipers are familiar with teaching methods in schools. This method is a method of learning in which teachers convey the meaning and description as well as the historical decline in the verses or hadith in question. The material diampaikan by preachers came from his teacher and so connect to a dial-up to the Companions and the Prophet. Likewise, the students will deliver the materials to others to be proxies. So the methods of learning are mutually binding in scientific or teachers and students have a relationship that never broken like a chain-breaking teputus.
In this context, the implementation of pure Islamic teaching methods will mengokondisikan purity and consistent teachings of Islam itself. These methods keep the thoughts in the direction reinterpret as against Islamic laws which would lead to divisions of religion. Indeed, ijtihad is recognized as one of the basic law but ijtihad is geared to provide solutions to actual problems with the legal basis of the Qur'an and Hadith.
Instead of Islamic learning can also be done by students, because students may have intelligent, read the book, meaning, and description. While the teacher listened, justify or blame. If students have read the book before the teacher and if the teacher can accept the science of the students are legitimate. This way is called a munawalah.
