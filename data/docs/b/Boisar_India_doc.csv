== History ==
Boisar was part of the Rashtrakuta dynasty which had ruled the Deccan plateau between the 8th and 10th centuries. It was ruled by Ahmadnagar (1521–1594), the Portuguese Empire (1594), the Maratha Empire (1739–1818), the East India Company (1818–1857) and the British Raj (1857–1947). There are some forts near the city, such as Asava Fort (11km), Tarapur Fort (11 km), Kaldurg Fort(17km), Shirgaon Fort (18km), Mahim Fort (20km), and Asheri Fort (25km).

Boisar was initially inhabited by the Kolis and Konkanis who were fishermen and used to live near the Arabian Sea coast. The Kolis are traditional fishermen who speak different dialects of Marathi.
The present Vanjari community of Boisar was part of the Indus Valley Civilization and originate from Chittorgarh, Rajasthan. In the 15th century they served as a main grain trader, supplier and salesman in the Mughal army of Alauddin Khalji. They migrated to "Moradi" port (today "Murbe") to trade in Boisar because the British started the railway in 1853 which halted the grain trade. Their language is distinct from standard Marathi as it influenced by Rajasthani and Gujarati.
The Vadval community is located in Boisar, Tarapur. They are said to be the descendants of Yadava dynasty of Devagiri who escaped from the Muslims. They form one of the few Marathi-speaking communities which belong to Kshatriya varna but not the traditional 96-clan Maratha caste.
Boisar was town in Bombay state between 18th to 19th century. It was also city in the Thane district after the independence of India. Palghar district is the current district of Boisar from 1 August 2014.
