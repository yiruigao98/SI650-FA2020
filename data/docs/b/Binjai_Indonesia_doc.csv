== History ==
The origin of Binjai when it established itself as a city is unknown. Historically the Binjai area was situated between two Malay kingdoms, Deli and Langkat. Binjai grew from a small village on the edge of the Bingai River.
According to both oral and written accounts of the history of the area, the city of Binjai grew from a small village located on the edge of the Bingai river, approximately where the Pekan Binjai village is located today. Traditional ceremonies were held to lay the foundations of the small village in the shade of a large Binjai Tree at the edge of the Bingai river, which flows into the Wampu River, which is navigable for a large portion of its length.
Around the tree were built several houses, which were gradually enlarged, until finally a village hall was built. A lively port also developed, visited by barges from Stabat, Tanjung Pura and Strait of Malacca. Over time, the Binjai tree gave its name to the growing city.


== Geography ==
Binjai is located between the Mencirim, Bangkatan and Bingai rivers. On average, it is 28 m above sea level.  As the crow flies, Binjai is only 8 km from Medan, although Kabupaten Deli Serdang separates the two.  However, the route of the Sumatara Highway increases the effective distance between the two cities to 22 km.
The two nearby rivers, the Bingai and Mencirim Rivers satisfy the needs of the city for clean water, which is distributed by the local water company. However, there are many citizens on the outskirts of the city who rely on wells for their water supply.


== Government ==
Binjai city is divided into 5 districts  (kecamatan): Binjai Timur, Binjai Kota, Binjai Selatan, Binjai Barat and Binjai Utara, which are further divided into 37 villages (kelurahan).
The mayoral office is located in the Town Hall, at Jenderal Sudirman Road No. 6. In 2009, Muhammad Idhaham, Msi was elected to this position for the period 2009–2014. 
Formerly, Binjai was the location for the headquarters of the Langkat Police Force, which had responsibility for policing both the city of Binjai and Kabupaten Langkat. However, in 2001 the police force was split, with the creation of a Binjai police force, while the headquarters for the Langkat Police Force moved to Stabat.
Directly in front of the town hall is the Lapangan merdeka (Freedom Square), a civic open space, as well as the Pendopo Umar Baki, a building used for a variety of official and unofficial functions.
