This article relates to the Belgian coastal town of Blankenberge. For German towns with the near-homophonous names, see Blankenberg or BlankenburgBlankenberge ([ˈblɑŋkə(m)bɛrɣə]; West Flemish: Blanknberge) is a town and a municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the town of Blankenberge proper and the settlement of Uitkerke.
On 1 December 2014, Blankenberge had a total population of 19,897. The total area of the municipality is 17.41 km², giving a population density of 1,142 inhabitants per km².
Like most other Flemish coastal towns, a main characteristic of this one is that it is a national and to a certain extent international seaside resort, as even Germans have found their way to the place.
Apart from the sandy beach, there's a structure unique along the Belgian coast: a 350-m long art-deco pier, the Belgium Pier, constructed in 1933.
