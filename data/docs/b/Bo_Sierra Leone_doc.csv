People from the surrounding villages came to receive their share. Because the amount of meat was so large, the hunter spent days distributing it and the words "Bo-lor" (which in Mende language means "this is yours," with reference to the meat) was said so much that the elders and visitors decided to name the place Bo. "Bo-lor" in Mende also translates to "this is Bo."
