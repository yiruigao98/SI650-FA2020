== History ==

Blackwood, originally known as Blackwoodtown, was settled about 1750 by John Blackwood in an area then known as "head of Timber Creek." Blackwood was a fuller who immigrated from Scotland and established mills in Blackwoodtown. The area was a crossroads village along the Black Horse Pike well into the nineteenth century, that served as a local government and transportation center by the 1830s, when Uriah Norcross established a stage coach line between Camden and Woodbury with a stop at a tavern in Blackwoodtown. The arrival of the Camden County Railroad in 1891 led to further development.
Blackwood Lake operated as a summer resort from 1891 until 1932.The Blackwood Historic District (roughly covering the area along Church Street from East Railroad Avenue to Indiana Avenue, Black Horse Pike, and Central Avenue) and Solomon Wesley United Methodist Church are listed in the properties and districts on the National Register of Historic Places.
