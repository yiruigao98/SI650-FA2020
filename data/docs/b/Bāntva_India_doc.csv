Bantva-Manavadar or Manavadar State was a princely state during the era of the British Raj in India. It was located on the Kathiawar peninsula in Gujarat. The state had an area of approximately 574 km² and contained 26 villages with a primarily Hindu population of 26,209 in 1941.


== History ==


=== Mughal era ===
Bantva is described as Bantva Choryashi is Ain-i-Akabari. Bantva was bestowed by Nawab Bahadur Khan (Sher Khan Babi) of Junagadh State, on his brothers Diler Khan Salabat Muhammed Khan Babi and Sher Zaman Khan in 1733 after their expulsion from Ghogha by Sohrab Khan, But some say that Sohrab Khan himself bestowed on them the pargana when he was foujdur of Sorath. Bantva had remained, in the hands of the descendants of Diler Khan and Sher Zaman Khan, and was one of the richest parganas in the province.


=== As vassals of Junagadh ===
The Bantva chieftains in after-times frequently caballed against the Nawab of Junagad but were invariably forced to sue for peace though Mukhtar Khan and Edal Khan on one occasion captured Vanthali but they were driven by the Diwan Amarji of Junagadh. The Nawab of Junagadh, in 1794-95, bestowed his share of the Visavadar parganas on the Bantva chieftains on the occasion of his marriage with a lady of their house. They however so oppressed the Kathis that they went out in outlawry, and drove out the Bantva thana of Visavadar. Afterwards, however, this share of Bantva in Visavadar again fell into the hands of Junagadh.There was three principal branches of the Bantva family:
the Hanavadar branch represented by Ghazanfar Khan
the Gidar branch represented by Samat Khan and Anvar Khan
the branch of Bantva represented by Sher Khan and others.


=== Annexation to India ===

In 1818, the state became a British protectorate. On 14 September 1947, following the independence of the new Dominions of India and Pakistan, the Khan Sahib Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji unilaterally acceded the state of Manavadar to Pakistan, even though, being a de facto vassal state of Junagadh State, the state had no such right to do so. This act was done at the same time as his master, the Nawab of Junagadh. On 22 October 1947 India took over the administration and Indian police forces were sent into Manavadar, where the Khan Sahib was placed under house arrest at Songadh.
An interim administrator was appointed to carry on the governance of the state, during which time the Government of India held a plebiscite in his domain. Participants voted in favour of union with India and on 15 February 1948                the accession to Pakistan was rescinded. After the state acceded to India, it was merged with the federated state of Saurashtra on 20 February 1949.


=== Rulers ===

Bantva Manavadar rulers belonged to the Babi Dynasty. It was a non-salute state. They held the title of Khan Sahib.
