Although Saturday March 13-year 1971 is commonly given as her birth date she celebrates her birthday on March 6, and this is the date of birth on her ID card. On her Facebook page the year she was born is given as 1969. Her mother could not remember the exact date she was born, not uncommon in rural Thailand in previous decades.

She began performing in her early teens. She made 20 audio-only recordings for GMM Grammy and later a further five for the Master Tape record label. She has since made a further series of recordings for Master Tape, variously entitled Luk tung sa on and Mor lam sa on, each on VCD, CD and audio tape formats ("sa on" in the Isan language meaning roughly "enjoyable").A number of greatest hits collections have also been issued, some of which contain videos of songs from the first audio-only series. Her first five albums included only luk thung, but since then most have combined luk thung, mor lam and sometimes string (Thai pop). Her most famous string songs are "Mah Tummai" [Thai: มาทำไม] and "Faen Ja," both in collaboration with Thongchai McIntyre. She tours with a live show from September to May each year and has made several appearances in Europe and North America.Among her best-known songs is "Sǎo Isǎan plát tìn" [Thai: สาวอีสานพลัดถิ่น] ("Isan girl separated from her home," album 9), which incorporates the typical Thai country themes of poverty, homesickness and an unfaithful lover. "Arlai World Trade" ("Mourning the World Trade Center," album Luk tung sa on 6) aroused comment in Thailand's English-language press for the way it addressed the September 11, 2001 attacks: "the reigning Morlam superstar of Thailand laments the attacks of September 11 while young, bare-midriffed Thai girls gyrate in front of a surging American flag".In 2003, the Thai Ministry of Culture proposed banning one of her songs, "Tears of a Lieutenant's Wife" ("Namta mia nairoi") on state-run media.By February 2006, she had released 38 original albums plus numerous compilations.
