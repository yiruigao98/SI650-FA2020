Busko-Zdrój [ˈbuskɔ ˈzdrui̯] ( listen) is a spa town in Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, Poland. It is the capital of Busko County. In 2010, its population was 32,274.


== History ==
The origin of Busko goes back to the 12th century, when a group of shepherds settled around St. Leonard's church. In 1185, Knight Dersław, the owner of Busko and its surroundings, brought Norbertine nuns, whom in his will he inscribed i.a. the village of Busko. Dersław was probably killed in the Battle of Chmielnik in 1241 (see: Mongol invasion of Poland). In 1251, it received a revenue privilege from King Bolesław V the Chaste (Bolesław Wstydliwy) allowing the convent to use the salt water. This is the first record of the use of Busko's mineral waters.
In 1287, Busko was granted civic rights by King Leszek II the Black. The advantageous location of the town on trade routes led King Władysław Jagiełło to grant local burghers the right to have a weekly market and two fairs a year beginning in 1412. The 15th and 16th centuries were considered the "heyday" of the town. It was famous for its trade and cloth production.

== Health Spa ==


=== History ===
The first document mentioning brines in Busko is the revenue privilege of Bolesław Wstydliwy from 1252. Jan Winterfeld conducted research on using health waters to treat illness in 1808. When Feliks Rzewuski leased Busko in 1820, he built the spa Amenities, which was designed by Henryk Marconi.
The opening ceremony of the health spa took place in 1836. Ferdynand Werner, Warsaw's pharmacist, published a full analysis of the water from Rotunda in 1832.
The city lost its city rights in 1869. This had a negative impact on the development of the city.
Aleksander Dobrzański, a doctor, became a new tenant in the 1880s.
Since then, the health resort has become one of the most important health resorts in the country. Aleksander Michalski, an engineering geologist, drilled four new wells. Busko then had three times more water for medicinal purposes.
Franciszek Gervais showed the exact characterisation of the dynamics, physical features and chemical composition of waters from the new water intake in 1897.
After the First World War, bathers began to arrive at the health resorts. Very intensive expansion of the health resort occurred in the interwar years, which was started by Dr. Szymon Starkiewicz, who founded a children's sanatorium under the name 'Górka'. Busko won first place at the competition for the prettiest health resort in Poland, in 1966.
'Włókniarz' - the biggest sanatorium was handed over in 1972. On 30 December 2008, there was the opening of Uzdrowiskowy Zakład Górniczy "Las Winiarski". It gives Busko's sanatorium the waters of sulphide from a new borehole, located in the town of Las Winiarski.
