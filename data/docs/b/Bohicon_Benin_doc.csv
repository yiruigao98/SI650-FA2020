== Cityscape and economy ==

The city has a mosque and the Jehovah's Witnesses also have a church in Bohicon. A congregation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was established in the city in October 2019.
Bohicon Railway Station is located in the city centre and the main hotel worth mentioning is the Jardin de l'Hotel de Ville De Bohicon which is set in a garden park with a restaurant.
Given the excellent road and rail networks that connect to Bohicon, it is an important trade centre that is the third largest in the country after Cotonou and Parakou. Trade is the primary activity of the city and its real name "Gboxicon" derives from the extensive sheep marketing that takes places in the city, literally meaning  "market sheep". The market is of considerable size and there is a notable drum shop located in Bohicon.
The Maquis Malodie market is also known for its cuisine with a number of stalls serving omelette and coffee in the mornings and stacks of pepper and attracts thousands of traders from all over Benin. A speciality sold in the market is afitin (soy dawa-dawa/soy iru), which is traditionally and somewhat famously in Benin made by women in the region. It is a protein-rich fermented food widely used in West Africa as a seasoning.
After sheep marketing and the processing of food, industrial handcraft is also important in the local economy including textiles. Thousands of craftsmen and craftswomen produce in the privacy of their workshop products for export. In the surrounding area in Bohicon commune, a number of agricultural crops are produced in subsistence farming including maize, cotton, peanuts and oil, yams, sorghum and cassava many of which are cultivated in plantations. There are also small livestock farms with cattle and goats. In short, trade and transportation alone occupy more than 40% of the population. As an economic effect though, Bohicon faces serious problems with the environment and sanitation due to industrial waste.
