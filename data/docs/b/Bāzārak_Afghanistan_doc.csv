== History ==

The territory was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara between the early 16th century and the mid-18th century. As Ahmad Shah Durrani's northern Afghanistan conquest began Pavan area which contained today's Panjshir  was conquered by Ahmad Shah Durrani and officially accepted as a part of  Durranis by Murad Beg of Bukhara after a treaty of friendship was signed in or about 1750p, and became part of the Durrani Empire. It was fully ruled by the Durranis followed by the Barakzai dynasty, and was untouched by the British during the 19th century Anglo-Afghan wars. Panjshir was attacked multiple times during the Soviet-Afghan War, against Ahmad Shah Massoud and his forces.

In 1973, Mohammed Daoud Khan took over power in Afghanistan and began threatening to take back Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which was splited from Afghanistan by Durand line
. This was supported by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) but caused great anxiety in Pakistan. By 1975, the young Ahmad Shah Massoud and his followers initiated an uprising in Panjshir but were forced to flee to Peshawar in Pakistan where they received support from Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto
. Bhutto is said to have paved the way for the April 1978 Saur Revolution in Kabul by making Daoud spread the Afghan Armed Forces to the countryside. The Panjshir region was in rebel control from August 17, 1979 after an uprising, and the region was well defended by Mujahedeen commaders during the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War against the PDPA government and the Soviet Union.
After the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in 1992 the area became part of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. By late 1990s, Panjshir and neighboring Badakhshan province, served as a staging ground for the Northern Alliance against the Taliban government. On September 9, 2001, Defense Minister Massoud was assassinated by two al-Qaeda operatives. Two days later the September 2001 attacks occurred in the United States and this led to the start of a major U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
Containing the Panjshir Valley, in April 2004 Panjshir District of Parwan Province was turned into a province under the Karzai administration
. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) established several bases in the province. In the meantime, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) also established bases, a US-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) began operating in Panjshir in the late 2000s. As of 2012, security in the province is maintained by the Afghan National Police and the Afghan National Army.
