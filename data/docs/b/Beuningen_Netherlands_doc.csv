== History ==
The area in and around Beuningen was inhabited by the Romans. There are regularly excavations done in which Roman rests are found. 
In the 15th century there stood a small castle: Blanckenburgh. It was probably destroyed during the Eighty Years' War by Maurice of Orange.
Until about 1900 Beuningen was a poor farmers village, often struck by floods. Nevertheless, there were a few rich families, mostly farmers with a lot of land, who paid the highest tax in the area.
On januari 1st 1818 the municipality annexed town Weurt in the East and juli 1st 1980 the town Ewijk on the West.
Nowadays Beuningen has grown to a suburb of Nijmegen, with a lot of new neighbourhoods.
