== Typonym ==
According to local traditions, the name Buxar is derived from a lake in the town named Aghsar (effacer of Sin), which in course of time became Baghsar and took the present form that is Buxar. An another vedic legend states that, a sage or rishi named Besira transformed himself to take the look of a Tiger to frighten Durvasa rishi, and doomed by him to retain the form of Tiger forever. In order to restore his Hyman's form, Bedsira  bathed in the holy pond of Aghsar and worshipped Garushankar. To commemorate this event the spot was called Vyaghrasar and later became Baghsar (The Tiger's pond).


== History ==


=== Ancient ===
Buxar is considered as the home of many sages and authors of vedic hymns. It is also said that that it was originally called Vedagarbh (the womb of origin of Vedas).A detailed description of Buxar can be found in numerous Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas, the Puranas, the YogVashishtha (a treatise by Sage Vashishtha), the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and countless other sources. It was a place which was the abode of celestial sages and rishis, it was a forest full of beautiful flowers, fruit-laden trees, priceless medicinal herbs, ponds, lakes, hermitages & monasteries besides a huge variety of animals in its forests. It is said that approximately 80000 sages lived here, in their ashrams where they regularly performed vedic rituals, yagnas and scientific experiments. This place known as Siddhashram in former times was blessed by those sages. The great celestial sage Vishvamitra had also resided in this pious land to perform his rituals to complete his spiritual practice; that's why Buxar was a centre of India's sage culture, spirituality, occult practices as well as profound ancient sciences as well as being famous as the "tapobhumi"(site of ritual) of sage Vishvamitra.
Long time back Lord Vaman, who was the 5th and first human incarnation of the supreme Lord Vishnu took birth on the pious banks of the of River Ganga in Siddhashram (present day Buxar) and later went on to vanquish the asura king Mahabali as the asuras had started terrorizing the world and crimes & sins were being committed by them on a mass scale.
In the Ramayan period, Siddhashram was the site of rituals for Sage Vishvamitra who along with many other sages use to perform vedic yagnas and scientific research. Their experiments were regularly disturbed by asuras and demons living in the jungle. So Sage Vishvamitra decided to take the help of Prince Ram (who was yet another incarnation of Vishnu) and his brother Lakshman, the Princes of Kosal, the sage gave the princes his knowledge of divine and celestial weapons besides giving them much important knowledge. These weapons were later on used by Ram to defeat the asura Ravan and achieve the purpose of his life (Lord Vishnu had incarnated as Prince Ram to kill that demon king) Thus it was Buxar, where an enlightened Ram's magnificent personality erupted, the sage's grace awakened their immeasurable power and the world came to know that he was indeed an incarnation of god. Ram also used this knowledge to fight and kill the dreaded asuras viz Tadaka and her sons Mareech and Subahu who used to disturb the rishis in their rituals.
The Buxar Fort situated in Charitravan, Buxar is a medieval fortress on the banks of river Ganga, built by King Rudradev of the Parmar Dynasty in A.D. 1054 on the same spot where Sage Vishvamitra's ashram was located and the place where Ram slayed Tadaka. The Fort was abandoned but later on it was repaired by King Bhojdev and was used by subsequent rulers of the Parmar Dynasty.
The historic Battle of Chausa fought on the battlefield of Chausa, situated 10 miles southwest of Buxar city was a notable military engagement on 26 June 1539 between the forces of the Afghan king Sher Shah Suri and Mughal Emperor Humayun in which the latter was badly defeated by the Afghan king .
Battle of Buxar was fought on 22 October 1764, between the forces under the command of the British East India Company, led by Hector Munro, and the combined armies of Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal, Nawab of Awadh Shuja-ud-Daulah and Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II . It was a decisive victory for the British East India Company as the combined forces of the Indian kings were ultimately routed by the British forces eventually leading to the beginning of the East India Company's consolidation and stronghold over Indian politics and conquest of the Indian subcontinent.
