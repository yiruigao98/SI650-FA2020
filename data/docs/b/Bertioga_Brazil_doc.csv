The municipality contains the 9,312 hectares (23,010 acres) Restinga de Bertioga State Park, created in 2010 to protect an area of mangroves, restinga and dense rainforest.
Its limits are Mogi das Cruzes, Biritiba-Mirim and Salesópolis in the north, São Sebastião in the east, Atlantic Ocean to the south with Ilha de Santo Amaro (opposite to the city) and Santos in the west.
