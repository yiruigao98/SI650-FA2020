Bhayandar, also called Bhayander, is a suburb in Maharashtra, India, part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. It is in the north of Mumbai City and is governed by Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation (MBMC). It was once Asia's largest steel utensils manufacturer. It is also a railway station on the Western Line of Mumbai Suburban Railway. The city is 5.6 KM away from Ghodbunder Fort and port which was once major port of India for Arabian horse imports. The city is the major tourist gateway for Global Vipassana Pagoda which is 14.8 Km south of the city and to Essel World and Water Kingdom. The city also has 2 public Library and well designed Study Hubs. Bhayander is well connected to rest of Mumbai by railways (Mumbai Suburban Railway) and Roadways. The current Mayor of Bhayander is Geeta Bharat Jain.
It is 8 km north of Mumbai City and is governed by the Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation (MBMC). It is also a railway station on the Western Line of Mumbai Suburban Railway.
Like all railway stations on Mumbai suburban railway, Bhayandar is divided into two parts by the rail line: East and West. The West was traditionally residential and the East was predominantly an industrial area. Another distinct distribution between East and West Bhayandar is the food. East will provide you a huge range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes whereas West region offers predominantly vegetarian food. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. Government-owned salt pans and marshland in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a gargantuan industrial complex.
The east Indian villages in Bhayandar are Murdha, Rai, Morva, Dongri, Uttan, Pali Chowk, Tarodi etc. They were formed by Portuguese travelers when Vasai (formerly Bassein) was a famous port. One route for "Essel World" is via Gorai, one of the villages close to Bhayandar. Gorai is popular for its beach and nearby Manori beach and is a popular weekend getaway for Bhayandar residents. It also is a great place for meditators who visit the Pagoda. In the 1970s Bhayandar was a village before the builders converted the fertile farming land into a concrete jungle.
The MBMC's (Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation) main office is in Bhayandar (West). Departments like Property Tax, Octroi, Transportation, Health, Ambulance for Emergency, Library, Water, Education, Birth-Death Registration, Tree, Advertising Fee, Animals, Public Construction, City Development, Accounts, etc. are a part of the MBMC's suite.
The recent success of real estate in Mumbai has helped Bhayandar become one of the populated stations on the Western railway circuit. There are trains starting and ending at this station; this shows the growth of Bhayandar in the last decade. Nowadays Mira Bhayandar Municipal Transport (MBMT) bus service are provided which runs in the Mira - Bhayandar city. Mahanagar Gas (MGL) pipeline service is available. Tata Power, as well as Adani Energy, has 24-hour electric supply. Multiplex and hyper market called Maxus Mall which includes a six-screen multiplex and Big Bazaar. D-Mart and Sahakari Bhandar have made a mark in the city. Bhayandar has witnessed hike in property rates in a short time and have shown that Bhayandar is coming up as an important destination. The famous residential landmarks are Chandan Park, Jesal Park, Sarvoday Paradise, Golden Nest, Indralok in the East side.
There are many hotels in Bhayandar. One of the best is the Veg Sagar near flyover end, Bhayandar west. There are many playing grounds for children such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Ground, Agarwal and Maxus cricket ground and morva bhati ground.
Most recent development has been noticed with regards to hospitals having world class facilities for all. One of them being Mira-Bhayandar Institute for Reproductive Assistance (MIRA) providing fertility clinic and total woman care.
