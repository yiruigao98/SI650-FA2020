Baia Sprie (Romanian pronunciation: [ˌbaja ˈspri.e] (listen); Hungarian: Felsőbánya, German: Mittelstadt) is a town in the Maramureș County, northern Romania. Baia Sprie is situated at a distance of 9 km from Baia Mare.
The town administers three villages: Chiuzbaia (Kisbánya), Satu Nou de Sus (Felsőújfalu) and Tăuții de Sus (Giródtótfalu). Neighbouring communities are the city of Baia Mare and the villages of Groși, Dumbrăvița, Șisești and Desești.

However, recent administrative changes and restructuring of the Romanian mining industry brought this activity to an almost complete halt.
