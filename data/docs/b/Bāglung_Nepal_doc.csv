The city is located at the cross-section of Kaligandaki corridor highway and midhill highway that transverse Nepal in north–south and east–west directions respectively.


== Geography and climate ==
Baglung Bazar is situated on a plateau overlooking the Kali Gandaki gorge directly south of the Dhaulagiri Himalayan range. Steep cliffs rising from the valley flank the plateau on three sides. City limits are roughly determined by the Theule Khola to the south, Kali Gandaki river to the east and Dhodeni Khola to the north.
Baglung enjoys warm summers and mild winters. Annual average temperatures range from a maximum of 26.6 °C (79.9 °F) and a minimum of 19.1 °C (66.4 °F). Highs above 35 °C (95 °F) and lows below 0 °C (32 °F) are rare. The average annual rainfall recorded is 1,060.9 mm (41.77 in) in 1982. Rainfall is heavily affected by the monsoon and most of it occurs during the months of June through September. Rest of the year is mostly dry and sunny. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city core, however, higher elevations within the city limits see occasional snow during the winter months. Due to large topographic variation climate ranging from hot subtropical to temperate montane climate can be experienced within the city limits.


== history ==
Pilgrims from India and rest of Nepal traveling to Muktinath and traders seeking to barter grains from the south with salt from Tibet frequented a trade route along the banks of Kaligandaki river since ancient times. However, owing to its location high above the banks of Kaligandaki river and the trade route few actually ventured into the area that is Baglung Bazar today. The area also lacked reliable source of water for drinking and irrigation making it poorly suited for settlement. A lack of evidence of structures and settlements predating 16th century in the area and a lack of mention in historical records predating 16th century support this notion. First confirmed history of settlement in Baglung is found during the reign of King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat (later Galkot) Kingdom in the early 16th century.
In year 1534 AD King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat married daughter of king Manimukunda Sen of Palpa. As the wedding procession reached Baglung, following a dream, the king decided to establish goddess Kalika brought from Palpa at the site. Holder of the goddesses sword Chakra Panwar was given the title of Khadka and asked to stay back as caretaker of the goddess. He was also bestowed with the land that forms Baglung Bazar today. The Magar carriers of the idol were settled in Lung Gau area of Baglung. A temple was built and an annual fair was started during the Chaitre Dashain festival. Descendants of Chakra Panwar Khadka built irrigation channels, pastures, watering holes, fruit gardens and established first establishments in Baglung. Baglung also emerged as an outpost for revenue collection and taxation as the Khadka family also served as local revenue collection officers and militia commanders.
Three hundred years later, following annexation of the Parbat kingdom by Gorkha, Newar traders from Bhaktapur arrived in Baglung and established permanent trading houses and market. During this era Baglung was also proclaimed as a "choti gauda" or district headquarters and official judicial, military, mint and taxation offices were established. Baglung continued to act as administrative headquarters during the Rana regime. After establishment of the current district and zonal system Baglung retained its status as headquarters serving the area.


== Transportation ==
Completion of several road projects have put Baglung at the crossroads of major north–south and east–west highway systems of Nepal. Tracks have been opened for Kaligandaki corridor highway connecting Tibet to the north via Mustang and border towns in the south. Similarly, midhill highway that connects eastern and western halves of Nepal passes through the city. Hari Bahadur Khadka memorial road connects Baglung with Kushmi Sera in the south and also provides access to Balewa airport.  Baglung is connected to Beni Bazar of Myagdi to the north and Kusma Bazar of Parbat which are located 13 km (8.1 mi) to the north and 12 km (7.5 mi) to the south-east, respectively.

Recently under initiative of late member of parliament Hari Bahadur Khadka a road network connecting Baglung Bazar with Bihu that passes through settlements higher in the northern flanks of Kathe Khola valley has been completed. In addition to major highways several narrow seasonal dirt roads connect the town with adjoining rural areas.
Suspension bridges meant for foot traffic are abundant in the area. So much so that the moniker "land of suspension bridges" is used to identify Baglung. Important crossings over Kaligandaki river are located at Pharse, Nirahe, Nayapul and Kaiya.

A mechanical cable-car spans the Kaligandaki river connecting Narayansthan with Kushma. Many other suspension bridges can be found spanning numerous rivers and rivulets within the city limit.
Baglung airport (code: BGL), in Balewa, is located 12 km to the south of the town across the valley from Kusma. With the completion of the Pokhara-Baglung highway this airport has fallen into disuse. Water transportation is virtually absent. However, the adjoining Kali Gandaki river offers some of the best white-water rafting in Nepal and attracts a decent number of thrill seekers every year.
