The Gombak District is an administrative district located in the state of Selangor, Malaysia.  The district was created on February 1, 1974, the same day when Kuala Lumpur was declared a Federal Territory. Until 1997, Rawang was the district capital; the capital has been moved to Bandar Baru Selayang. Gombak borders Kuala Lumpur to the southeast and the Genting Highlands to the east. Both Gombak and Kuala Lumpur, along with some other districts in Selangor, are situated within the Klang Valley. Other localities that are situated in Gombak district include Batu Arang, Kuang, Rawang, Bandar Kundang, Gombak Town, Selayang, 
Kepong and Hulu Kelang.

Gombak (town) also refers to as a locality (town/area/suburb) in the northern and central portion of the Setapak subdistrict (both in Gombak and Kuala Lumpur). Before 1974, Gombak was a town before it became a district. Gombak was home to the settlements of the first Minangkabau immigrants in the 1800s and was established soon after.
