Thailand divides its settlements (thesaban) into three categories by size: cities (thesaban nakhon), towns (thesaban mueang) and townships (or subdistrict municipality) (thesaban tambon).  There are 32 cities as of January 2015. 
The national capital Bangkok and the special governed city Pattaya  fall outside these divisions. They are "self-governing districts".
Several agencies issue population figures. Locally registered Thai populations as compiled by the Department of Local Administration (DLA), also known as, "Locally Registered Thai Population". These figures reflect the migrant, upcountry, and seasonal nature of Thai labor flows to the capital and tourist hotspots, yet maintain upcountry registration. Figures are very different from those by National Statistics Office (NSO), which conduct the decennnial census counts that attempt to count total resident Thai population + under 1,000 permanent resident foreigners ("Total Thai Population"). Neither of these offices releases municipal level figures that include non-permanent resident, long stay expatriates and figures for contracted foreign ASEAN migrants (a significant labor segment in cities like Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai, and Phuket, totaling two to three million workers), though increasingly regularized since 2014. The NSO did release projected figures including regularized ASEAN migrants, i.e., "total resident population" down to the provincial level for 2017.
