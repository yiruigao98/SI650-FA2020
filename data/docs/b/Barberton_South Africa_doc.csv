The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. South Africa accepted the convention on 10 July 1997, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2018, there are nine World Heritage Sites in South Africa, including four cultural sites, four natural sites and one mixed site.

== Tentative list ==
In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. As of 2018, South Africa lists five properties on its tentative list:
