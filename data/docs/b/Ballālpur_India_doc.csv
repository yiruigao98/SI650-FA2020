== Etymology ==
The local people relate the name "Chandrapur" to the words Chandra (the moon) and pur (a settlement) after a legend. Scholars see the name as a derivative of "Indupur" (city of the moon) which stood near the Jharpat in the Treta Yuga.


== History ==
There are many stone age sites in Chandrapur District. Suresh Chopane, a renowned researcher, found many stone age tools in the district, which has been displayed in his Rock Museum. Archeological finds, such as signs of pottery making, suggest inhabitation of the Chandrapur area in Neolithic times.From ancient times, Chandrapur has fallen under the control of many different rulers. Between 322 BCE and 187 BCE, much of India, including Maharashtra, was part of the Maurya Empire. From 187 BCE to 78 BCE, Chandrapur was part of the Shunga Empire which controlled much of central and eastern India. The Satavahana Empire controlled Chandrapur from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. The Vakataka dynasty ruled from the area from the mid 3rd century CE to 550 CE. The Kalachuri dynasty ruled in the area in the 6th and 7th centuries CE. The Rashtrakuta dynasty followed, controlling the Chandrapur region between the 7th and 10th centuries. The Chalukya dynasty ruled in the region to the 12th century CE. The Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of Devagiri ruled a kingdom, including the Chandrapur area, in approximately 850 CE and continued until 1334 CE.The Gond people are part of the Adivasi (indigenous people) of India. In ancient times, the Gond diaspora spread throughout central India. After the passage of many kings, who were largely subservient to other rulers, the Gond king, Khandkya Ballal (1470 – 1495) came to the throne. He founded Chandrapur.As per legends, Khandkya, who resided in Sirpur, was covered in tumours. His wise and beautiful wife nursed him. She asked him to leave Sirpur and move to the north bank of the Wardha River. There, the king built a fort he named "Ballalpur" and thus founded city of Ballarpur. One day, while hunting northwest of Ballalpur, the king became thirsty and rode up to the dry bed of the Jharpat river in search of water. He discovered water trickling from a hole, and after drinking, washed his face, hands and feet. That night he slept soundly for the first time in his life.
On his return the queen was delighted to see that many of the tumours on her husband's body had disappeared. The king said it was the water that had cured him and took his wife to see the water hole. On clearing the grass and sand, they found five footprints of a cow in the solid rock, each filled with water. The water source at the spot was inexhaustible and considered holy. The place was called "Tirtha of Acalesvar of the Treta Yuga". When the king bathed in the water, all the tumours on his body vanished. That night at the water hole, Acalesvar appeared to the king in a dream and spoke comforting words. A temple was built over the water hole.
One morning, at the water hole, the king saw a hare darting out of a bush and chasing his dog. Eventually, the dog killed the hare. The king found a white spot on the forehead of the hare. The queen said it was a good omen and a fortified city should he built with its layout based on the chase of the dog and hare. She said the place where the hare was killed would be unlucky for the city. The king's officers, the "Tel Thakurs" built the fortified city. The city became Chandrapur.
Gond rule was lost in 1751 to the Maratha period. The last ruler of the Maratha dynasty, Raghuji Bhonsle III died in 1853 without issue.
In 1853, Chandrapur was annexed to British India. During the British colonial period the area of Chandrapur was called "Chanda". By 1871, Anglican and Scottish Episcopal missionaries had arrived in the city. In 1874, three tehsils were created: Viz Mul, Warora and Bramhpuri. The upper Godavai district of Madras was abolished and four tehsils were added to Chandrapur to form one tehsil with Sironcha, approximately 150 km to the south, as its centre of governance. In 1895, the headquarters was transferred to Chandrapur. In 1905, a new tehsil with headquarters at Gadchiroli was created through the transfer of zamindari estates from Bramhpuri and Chandrapur tehsil. In 1907, a small area of land was transferred from Chandrapur to the newer districts and another area of about 1560 km2, comprising three divisions of the lower Sironcha tehsil (Cherla, Albak and Nugir) were transferred to Madras State. Between 1911 and 1955, no major changes occurred in the boundaries of the district or its tehsils.
In 1956, with the reorganization of Indian states, Chandrapur district was transferred from Madhya Pradesh to Bombay state. In 1959, part of Adilabad district of Hyderabad state, was transferred to Chandrapur district. In May 1960, Chandrapur district became part of the Maharashtra state. Following the 1981 Census of India, Chandrapur district was divided into Chandrapur district and Gadchiroli district.

DeekshabhoomiOn 16 October 1956, Dr B. R. Ambedkar (Babasaheb) gave the deeksha (the embracing of Buddhism) to many followers at a place near Chandrapur since known as Deekshabhoomi. Ambedkar chose only Nagpur and Chandrapur for the conversion of the people to Buddhism. Rajabhau Khobragade, a barrister established the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar College of Arts, Commerce and Science on the Deeksha Bhoomi premises. A transplanted branch of the Bodhi Tree (a sacred fig from Bodh Gaya) is growing at the Deekshabhoomi. On 15 and 16 October, there is an annual pilgrimage of followers and monks to Deekshabhoomi for the Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din.
On October 16, 1956, Dr.  Dhammadiksha ceremony held at Chandrapur in the presence of Babasaheb Ambedkar
Dikshabhumi It is a well known fact that the great man Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar entered Buddhism on 14th October 1956 at Nagpur at the hands of Bhikku Mahasthaveer Chandramani and his 5 lakh followers.  This was a very unique event in the history of the world.  The people of Vidarbha should be especially proud of these golden moments which have established a just humanitarian society by breaking the shackles of unjust and inhumane practices that have been going on for generations.  In addition, on 16th October 1956 at Chandrapur (then Chanda) Dr.  It is equally important to note the second conversion that took place at the hands of Ambedkar himself.
In fact, Dr. coming to East Vidarbha next to Nagpur.  This was not Ambedkar's first time.  Babasaheb had contested the 1954 elections from Bhandara constituency, which now includes Bramhapuri and Chimur constituencies in Bhandara district and Chandrapur district.  Then, in the summer of April 29, 1954, Dr. Ambedkar had held a meeting at Pawani and Wadsa.  In his speech at the meeting at Pawani, Babasaheb had also glorified the ancient Buddhist holy city.  On their way to Vadasya, they had a short rest and snack at Gawande's restaurant at the old bus stand in Nagbhid.  The locals then told him about their problems and submitted statements about it.  Their meeting at Wadsa was as loud as expected.  But unfortunately Babasaheb had to suffer an unexpected defeat from the Scheduled Caste group.
Devaji Khobragade of Chandrapur was a staunch activist of the Ambedkar movement.  Barrister Rajabhau Khobragade (1925-85), the son of Dr. Ambedkar and later a member of Rajya Sabha and later Deputy Speaker (1969-72), is his immortal.  While the conversion ceremony was being held in Nagpur, the Khobragade family persuaded Babasaheb to hold an initiation ceremony in Chandrapur as well.  Babasaheb accepted this demand out of love for his workers.
After the Nagpur ceremony on 14th October 1956, on 16th October at 5 am Dr.  Babasaheb is Maisaheb, Nanakchand Rattu and Ba.  Rajabhau left Nagpur with Khobragade.  It was decided to bring Babasaheb to Chandrapur by car on the Nagpur-Umred-Nagbhid-Mul-Chandrapur route, avoiding the usual route 'Nagpur-Butibori-Jam-Warora-Chandrapur' from Nagpur to Chandrapur.  Therefore, this path passing through the bush was sanctified by the visit and touch of this great man.  Nagbhid, who was on the same path, got the merit of seeing this great man for the second time on this day.  Babasaheb's health was deteriorating then.  Like their struggling lives, this route was very hazy and difficult for them to travel, so they had to stop many times.  Devaji Khobragade and some activists came to the child and stopped to greet him.  When they had lunch at the boy's rest house, they were given sorghum bread and flour made at the house of a worker named Govardhan, who lived nearby.  After the rest, Babasaheb came straight to the Government Circuit House in Chandrapur from Mul around noon, when it was 4 pm.
Exhausted at 7 pm, Babasaheb came to the planned place of Dhammadikshe (near Old Warora Naka) on the basis of his famous Dhammakathi.  (This octagonal stick in his hand is still with the sheep family in Nagpur during both the Nagpur and Chandrapur ceremonies and during the journey.)  Activists from Sironcha, Aheri, Armori, Ballarshah, Chimur, Gadchandur, Gadhi Surla, Pombhurna, Navargaon, Mul, Warora, Bhadravati, Chamorshi, Gadchiroli, Nagbhid were sweating day and night for the month.  The Samata Sainik Dal had set up a very tight security on this ground.
Babasaheb ordered the people to 'get up, stand up'.  Even in the month of October, due to the rain, many insects were swarming around the tubelight on the ground.  Enthusiastic organizers tried to get rid of the insects but all the lights were turned off and it was completely dark.  At that time, a young activist of Tatkal Samata Sainik Dal, Dadaji Trisule, stood near the stage holding a light bulb in his hand.  In the light of that simple bulb, Babasaheb himself initiated the great Buddhism that grew up in the land of India, 'Buddha Sharan Gachchhami', and showed his followers and all his descendants a glorious path.  It was a thrilling experience experienced by almost two and a half lakh followers.  As Babasaheb delivered his speech in Nagpur, he gave 22 vows to his followers without giving a speech in Chandrapur.
On the 17th, Babasaheb rested in the circuit house for the whole day as he was not feeling well.  Khobragade only sent Maisaheb to his house at the request of the family.  On that day, Babasaheb announced his intention to give an informative speech in front of the activists next time, mentioning the richness of the ancient Buddhist city of 'Bhadravati'.  On the 18th, Dr. Ambedkar took the 'Grand Trunk Express' to Nagpur and from there to Delhi.  Later, however, he never returned to Vidarbha.  Only a month and a half later, on December 6, 1956, he passed away.  This is our small attempt to tell the world that the last and greatest unprecedented event in the struggling life of this great man, who changed the lives of millions of people through non-violent, constitutional and democratic means with the help of education and organization, has brought them out of the abyss of poverty and exploitation.
