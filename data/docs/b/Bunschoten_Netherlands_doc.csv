== History ==
Bunschoten was first named in 1294.  It was located on the border between Utrecht and Guelders, and it suffered a number of times from invasions from Guelders.  In 1383, the bishop of Utrecht gave Bunschoten city rights, which allowed the citizens to build an earthen wall around the town. The fortifications and a part of the town were destroyed at Christmas 1427 in a war between two rival bishops, and were never rebuilt.
