== History ==

The name Bsharri (بشرّي), Beth Shareer, can be found in the Aramaic language. Bsharri means House of Truth in Aramaic. Maronite Christians fleeing persecution sought refuge in its mountainous terrain in the 7th Century AD.  The Kadisha Valley, below the town, became the spiritual center of the Maronite Church. The town was known as Buissera by the Crusades.

In Lebanon, Bsharri natives are characterized as very courageous and tribal. They are known across the northern region for their hospitality and patriotism. They are especially known for their distinct accent when they speak Lebanese Arabic.  Unlike other parts of Lebanon, Aramaic was spoken in Bsharri well into the 19th century.  As a result, Bsharri natives developed an unmistakably strong accent which lasts to this day.During the Lebanese civil war (1975–1990), Bsharri was a bastion of Christian resistance against the Palestinians and the Syrians. Many of its youth joined the Lebanese Phalanges at the start of the civil war. In 1986 Samir Geagea, a Bsharri native, became head of the Lebanese Forces (LF) militia (now a political party). Many LF militants were drawn from the town during the civil war. Bsharri natives are often referred to as defenders of the Maronite Christianity in Lebanon.
Unlike most of the other villages around, Bsharri is continuously inhabited during all the months of the year. That is why, even in the coldest days of winter, one can still find open shops to purchase their everyday needs.
