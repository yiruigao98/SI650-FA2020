Baoshan  (Chinese: 保山; pinyin: Bǎoshān, historically also Yongchang) is a prefecture-level city in western Yunnan province, People's Republic of China. Baoshan is the second-biggest metropolitan area in western Yunnan after Dali.


== Geography and climate ==

Baoshan is located between the border of Burma and the Lancang river (Mekong); specifically it borders the Burmese states of Kachin to the northwest and Shan to the south. The Nujiang (Salween River) flows through the entire length of the prefecture, north to south.
Tempered by the low latitude and moderate elevation, Baoshan has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cwb), with short, mild, dry winters, and warm, rainy summers. Frost may occur in winter but the days still generally warm up to around 16 to 17 °C (61 to 63 °F), with a January average of 9.1 °C (48.4 °F). The warmest month is June, which averages 21.5 °C (70.7 °F). Nearly three quarters of the annual rainfall occurs from June to October.


== Demography ==
The prefecture has about 2.5 million inhabitants.


== Administrative divisions ==
The city-prefecture of Baoshan has jurisdiction over five subdivisions—a district, one county-level city and three counties:

Tengyue, the other major populated area in the county, successfully lobbied for and achieved city status in 2015-16 and is currently in the process of separating itself and the surrounding Tengchong area from Baoshan administratively.
