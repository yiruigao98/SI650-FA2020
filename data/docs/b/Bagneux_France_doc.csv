Cimetière parisien de Bagneux is one of the three Parisien cemeteries extra muros, located in Bagneux. The cemetery has a large Jewish section (many of the divisions have exclusively Jewish graves) and is sometimes known as the Jewish cemetery.


== History ==
Before the site became a cemetery, it was the scene of heavy fighting in May 1871, in the war between the Versaillais and the Fédérés.
The cemetery was opened on 15 November 1886 and is one of the three Parisien Cemeteries extra muros, the others being Cimetière parisien de Thiais (openend in 1929) and Cimetière parisien de Pantin. It was opened at the same time as Pantin, (which is northeast of Paris). Both have similar entrances. Bagneux is the smallest of the three cemeteries serving Paris, but the most active.


== Notes ==
The cemetery is still open and there are about 10 burials a day. The cemetery is divided into 115 divisions. It is estimated that there are around 83000 graves.
The cemetery was the burial place of Oscar Wilde until his remains were moved to Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Similarly, Jeanne Hébuterne, the model and artist who was Amedeo Modigliani's lover and mother of his only child, was originally buried here. Despondent over his death, Jeanne Hébuterne committed suicide and her family interred her at Cimetière de Bagneux until finally relenting and allowed her remains to be transferred to the Père Lachaise Cemetery in 1930 to rest beside Modigliani.There are nearly 5,500 trees (about 20 different species). It is home to many birds (35 different species have already been counted) and squirrels.

=== Monuments ===
There are monuments for:

Jews who died in the Second World War (division 1)
The Warsaw Ghetto (division 115)
The victims of concentration camps and those who died as a result of "Nazi barbarism". There are many of these monuments in the  Jewish divisions.


=== Military graves ===
The cemetery has a number of military sections.
There are two divisions dedicated to the French Military who died in the First and Second World War.
Division 19 contains two sections dedicated to British Commonwealth dead and which are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. These plots contain around 35 Commonwealth service war graves of the First World War (mostly British soldiers who died in 1914), and a few from the Second.
