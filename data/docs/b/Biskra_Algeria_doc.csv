== Etymology ==
The city has been known by several names, including Biskra, Sokkra, Vescra, Vecera, Vescera, Adbesran. Historians do not agree on the origins of the current name. Some say its name comes down from the name Vescera, which means "station" or "place" of commercial exchange, due to its geographical location that connects north to south. But the Roman leader Betolimih BenyoubaII gave it another name, "the river of destiny", which is due to the river of Sidi Zarzour (its current name) that crosses the city.Some researchers say that its name originates from the ancient Roman name "Adebesran," due to the ancient geothermal source that is located near the city, known as Salhine Hammam. Other sources say that the real name comes down from the word "Sokkra", due to the better quality of the sweet dates that this city has everywhere in its oases. Still others claim that the current name was given to the city by the Carthaginians.


== History ==


=== Gaetuli ===
The Gaetuli first appeared in North Africa during the 3rd millennium BC. They settled on a large territory south of the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauritania. The Genset, a direct descendant of the branch of the Capesian civilization that migrated to the Sahara around 3000 BC, and is certainly the people who dominated in the most certain way Algeria during the 1500 years of its antiquity. They were according to the Greek historian Strabo the most numerous people of North Africa, but also the least known. Among the oldest references to the Gétules are probably those of the Carthaginians who indicate that the Prince of the Gétules proposed to marry Élyssa (or Dido for the Romans), the founding queen of Carthage (present Tunisia) around the year 815 BC. However, references in ancient Egypt of certain tribes go back to 1350 BC about in the reign of Akhenaton of the eighteenth dynasty that speaks of cattle trade with this people.
The Gétules are probably also the origin of the Berber calendar which begins around 943–949 BC. The beginning of this calendar would follow the victory of a coalition of Gétules over the Egyptians. This coalition, formed by the North African tribes, left the south-west of Algeria, reinforcing its force en route wherever it passed in North Africa. The coalition led by Sheshonq (Berber name: Sheshnaq) defeated Pharaoh Psousennes II. Following this victory Sheshnaq married the daughter of the pharaoh, settled on the throne of Egypt under the name of Sheshonq in 952 BC, and founded the XXII Dynasty. This biblical event is mentioned in the Old Testament, which speaks of the pillaging of this leader of the Machaouach tribe. (The Berber calendar is a creation of Ammar NEGADI, it is he who chose this date for origin, his calendar was published in 1980 through the Association Union du Peuple Amazigh -UPA).
The Gétules are the Berber nomads of the pre-Saharan of North Africa and speak the Berber language with some variations. They came from the desert of the Caspian Sea (the world's largest inland sea, bordering present-day Iran) and were forced to migrate following the destruction of a natural dam that left them without a water source for their livestock.  Specialists of the desert life, they first settled on the edge of the Nile.  However, the Pharaohs hunted them in the sixth century BC.
Always while traversing the desert, arrived until Tassili with the Touaregs where they stayed a long time, got mixed up with the Touaregs and learned the Tamazigh language for reasons of communication, cultural and commercial exchanges. Unfortunately felt like "Gringos" in these places, decided to continue path until "The Promised Land":
North Africa which has become almost theirs. In Algeria, they have set themselves at the limit of Aures for the dish to which they are accustomed, have posed problems to the Roman infiltration in the 3rd century BC because dreaded in combat and good horsemen. It was necessary to involve a late Roman politician, Marius, to negotiate exploration of the South against concessions of agricultural land around Cirta and Setifis, at the time under Roman rule; a trick of dispersing them
and so diminished in their strength. Thus, the Gétulie was occupied by the Romans (Biskra and its environs). This is what I learned from Charles Andrés Julien and Courteau, both history teachers at the Sorbonne and specialists in North Africa.


=== Roman Colonization ===
The city of Biskra experienced many very violent wars during the Roman colonization, including the great resistance war led by the Berber leader Tacfarinas. Followed by his successor the great healed militant Jugurtha "Youghorta" who resisted the Roman army. With the help of the inhabitants of the city, who did not hesitate to give their human and material support, Jugurtha destroyed the Roman army at the end of the so-called Noumidia region.


=== The Vandals in the 4th century ===
The Vandals "Oundals" invaded the city of Biskra and occupied all its land after a language resistance of its inhabitants. The weakness of the Vandals and lure falls in front of the resistance and the continuous fights of the inhabitants, forced them to integrate with the inhabitants of the Ziban in a complete way. 
After a few decades, the Romans took over the direction of the city where they built obstacles to protect themselves from the vengeance of the population.


=== The arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa El Fihri in the 7th century AD ===
They remained with such vigilance until the arrival of the Arab conqueror Okba Ben Nafaa Elfehri in the 7th century AD. During this period, the whole area came under another monarchy. it was the Arab-Muslim monarchy. After 20 years of conquest, Okba Ben Nafaa died in 683 AD with his army when he returned from Morocco. His death was organized by an ambush mounted by his adversary the Numidian prince (Berber) Koceila and his army at the place called Tahouda, a small village located 5 km from the oasis "Sidi Okba" whose body of this conqueror is based in the mosque of the city that took his name. According to the imam of this mosque, this place which contains more than 300 tombs, is the 4th holy place of Islam, after Mecca, Medina and Aksa.
In the early 10th century, Biskra and the entire Ziban area were conquered by the kings of Beni Hammad.


=== The Hillal Bannis in the 12th century AD ===
Followed by the Kabyla of Elathbend banished Hilal (Hilalian Arabs) who removed and confiscated the property of the inhabitants. They asked the help of the Almohads of the kingdom of Marrakech in the 12th century AD.


=== The Hafsids in the 14th century AD ===
In the 14th century AD, the Hafssid arrived in Tunisia and Algeria. Biskra became a very important pole for the Hafsids of Tunisia where it remained under lure monarchy and direction for a long time then under the authority of Mérinides of Fez and banned Abd-Elouadi and the Znatiyin of Tlemcen.


=== The conquest of the city by the Turks in 1541 ===
In 1541, the conquest of the city by the Turks began, under the direction of Hocine Agha who defended the city of Algiers at the time and brought out the strength of Charles Compte of the latter.
The Ottoman Empire remained in the city 3 centuries until the French colonization in 1830.


=== French colonization from 1844 ===
Indeed, after the invasion of the city of Biskra in 1844, and due to its protective geographical nature, the French army, built a secure area in its agglomeration to oppose the popular resistance of the inhabitants. But the progress of the liberation movement of El-hadj Mohammed Esaghire Elokbi, the successor or "caliphate" of El-Emir Abdelkader who went to General Lamoriciere on 23 December 1847, destroyed his armor and returned to a war of two fronts, the first against the Ben Ghana family and the French forces and the second front against the pillaging and embezzlement of Ahmed Bey and his monarchy in Constantine.
Thus, the opposition and the refusal of the rebels continued until the war of Zaatcha 20 kilometers west of Biskra in 1849. The refusal threatened the French to drag on throughout the Ziban area and could even spreading to Aurès under the leadership of Sheikh Bou Zian, who refused to pay the palm tax, Lieutenant Seroka, of the Arab Bureau of Biskra, the Zaatcha affair began.
During this first period, the war of Bou Zian, chief of tribe, is memorable. The columns entered the gardens, delimited by small walls, which surrounded the Ksours in the oases and formed an inextricable maze. The shooting was terrible, the natives retreated but there are already several dead and many wounded, finished with the knife by Bou Zian, and his men. Carbuccia, the French Colonel withdrew. The failure was serious, the moral effect disastrous. Bou Zian exploited his victory and sent burning letters to the AURES and ZIBAN people ...
Arrived in front of the zone called Zaatcha the French met a bastioned wall, crenelated, preceded by a ditch of 7 meters wide and 1 to 3 meters deep filled with water.
Colonel Carbuccia in charge of this mission was surprised by the topography of the ground and the resistance which opposed him in the middle of a dense vegetation. The struggles and fights continued for 7 months without stopping. It took 7,000 troops and 53 days of blockade for the destruction of the siege by the three colonels together: Canrobert, Barral, and Lourmel giving the death of Chief Bouzian with 1400 besieged and 2130 people on the French side.
This defeat did not diminish the will of the inhabitants to resist against the forces of the French armies. Indeed, the inhabitants led many wars the most known, was the war of El-kamri in 1879.
After nearly 100 years of events in Zaatcha, and in 1954, Biskra was among the important place where the War of 1 November began notably in the mountains of Aurès and in the adobe villages, all surrounded by palm trees, with the walls and the saguias separating the gardens, present to the assailant considerable difficulty.
