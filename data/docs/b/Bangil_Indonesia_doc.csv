== History ==

There is no reliable reference to explain how the name Bangil originated. The Santri group of students said that Bangil derived from Mbah Ngilmu, referring to a cleric who was known to be courageous in the defense of Islam. The more popular story in the wider community says that the name comes from the Javanese word Mbah'e Angel, where the word angel Means very difficult, referring to the character of the Bangil people that is difficult to change. The name of Bangil is also listed in an ancient Chinese documents stating that when King Ta'Cheh (either Muawiyah bin Abu Sufyan or his son Yazid I) sent a spy to monitor the Kalinga Kingdom, the messenger landed at  a small harbor named Banger, or Bang-il as the Chinese call it.

The city was also the place where Untung Surapati's last war against the Dutch's VOC in 1706 took place and also where he died.  Suropati's force tried to defend the fortification wall surrounding Bangil with its artillery, but eventually the Dutch, led by Govert Knol, defeated him and took over the town, where they lost about 400 to 500 soldiers of the Madurese.Arab merchants arrived around 1860 in the old town for trading, along with the Chinese merchants through a port  in Porong Creek, located between Bangil and Rembang. Although Bangil was a relatively small area used as a stopover village, it was already known by traders familiar with its economic potentials, before they spread to the surrounding areas. Since 1873, Hadharim settlements were created in Bangil under the leaderships of several Kapitan Arab such as Saleh bin Muhammad bin Said Sabaja (1892), Muhammad bin Saleh Sabaja (1920), and Muhammad bin Salim Nabhan (1930).Although not often noted in the historical literature, records show that Bangil was once reached by a Hindu kingdom, Medang Kamulan. However, Bangil is more known as a region that has very strong Islamic culture, including the presence of Islamic educational institutions spread throughout the city.
