Following the conflict in 1945 VfL was reorganized as Turn- und Sportverein Bad Berleburg. It was renamed Spiel- und Sportverein Bad Berleburg in 1947.On 21 February 1970 SSV merged with Turnverein 1863 Bad Berleburg and Skiclub 1909 Bad Berleburg with the newly formed club reclaiming its historical identity as VfL. They went on to advance out of Bezirksliga play through the Landesliga Westfalen to the Verbandsliga Westfalen where they played two seasons in 1975–76 and 1977–78. The team fared poorly in both campaigns and were twice relegated after finishing 17th and 18th.
