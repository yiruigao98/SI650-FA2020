== History ==
A king named Ahibaran is said to have laid the foundation of a fort called Baran here and established his capital named baranshahr. It was called Baran city and the name changed to Bulandshahr in official usages. Since it was perched on a highland it came to be known as "high city" (Persian: بلند شهر‎), which translates as Bulandshahr in Persian language during the Mughal era. There is a present-day place called Upper Court (Hindi: ओपरकोट) which is believed to be the Fort of Raja Ahibarna and old Baran was limited to this area. The kingdom of Baran came to an end probably during the 12th century. In 1192 CE when Muhammad Ghauri conquered parts of India, his general Qutubuddin Aibak surrounded Fort Baran and conquered it and the Raja Chandrasen Dodiya was killed and Aibak took control of the Baran kingdom.The ancient ruins found at places in Bhatora Veerpur, Ghalibpur, etc. are indicative of the antiquity of Bulandshahr. There are several other important places in the District from where statues belonging to the medieval age and objects of ancient temples have been found. Even today, several of these historical and ancient objects such as coins, inscriptions etc. are preserved in the Lucknow State Museum.
