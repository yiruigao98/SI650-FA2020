First news of settlements in the area dates from the 11th century AD, although the presence of Roman ruins testify the it was inhabited also in ancient times. In the Middle Ages Bastia was entangled in the struggle between the communes of Assisi and Perugia; in 1319, after a siege of seven months, troops from the latter ravaged it. Bastia was however quickly rebuilt with a new castle and 18 towers. From 1300 to 1594 it was a possession of Perugia, and subsequently of the Papal States. The suffix "Umbra" was added after the annexion to the newly unified Kingdom of Italy in 1860.
