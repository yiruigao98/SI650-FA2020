A total of 20 states, as well as the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 83 municipalities (mostly located in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota), have banned the discredited practice of conversion therapy on minor clients. Penalties range from fines to imprisonment. The District of Columbia is the only U.S. jurisdiction whose ban also applies to adults.

Others include the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, and many more.
