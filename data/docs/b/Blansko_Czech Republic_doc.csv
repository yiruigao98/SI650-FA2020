== History ==
Blansko was mentioned for the first time as the site of dispute between Jindřich Zdík, the bishop of Olomouc and Prince Wratislaus of Brno regarding the rights to construct a church in the village on the right bank of the Svitava river in 1136. In 1277 Bruno von Schauenburg then Bishop of Olomouc and landlord founded a village on the left bank of the Svitava. Originally known as 'New Blansko' it became the core of the modern town. After the founding of New Blansko, the villages went through possession of various landowners. The two villages finally merged to a single one in 1526.
From 1698 the Gellhorn family founded the first foundry and ironworks in Blansko. After 1766 the town belonged to the Salm family, who patronized many artisans and scientists, including Josef Dobrovský. Blansko also underwent vast expansion connected to the growth of ironworks under the guidance of Hugo František Salm. In January 1849 the first train arrived to Blansko on newly constructed Brno–Česká Trebová railway line. In 1905, Franz Joseph I of Austria granted Blansko the status of the town. A member of the town council produced a commemorative folio describing the situation in Blansko at that time as relating to industry, education, associations etc. In 1949 Blansko became the capital of Blansko District instead of Boskovice.
