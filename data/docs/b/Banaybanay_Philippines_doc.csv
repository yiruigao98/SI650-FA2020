== Etymology ==
Banaybanay is derived from the two native words Banay (Kalagan word), meaning sprout due to its main livelihood in the area which is rice farming, and Bânay (Cebuano word) means clans due to the family clans that arrived in that area that came from Visayas Islands and Luzon and settled there along together with the Kalagans and Mandayan natives.


== History ==
Banaybanay was primarily inhabited by the Mandayas in the uplands of Causwagan, Panikian and Mahayag, and  Kalagans in shorelines and the mouth rivers of Piso, Pongoton, Mogbongcogon and Maputi which they have a strong settlement and a Muslim governance on that area leads by a Datus or Imams.
Around the 1800s before Uyanguren arrived in the Davao, there was a strong community of the Kalagans (Kagan) in the Piso which was led by a chieftain named Datu Panayangan. Their dwelling was along the Piso River along with his people who lived there peacefully.
The story of the arriving of the Kallaw people from Samal Island is very well known especially among the Kalagans of Banaybanay. They arrived in the Piso to settle there along with their Kalagan brothers on the permission of Datu Panayangan. The Kallaw chieftain named Datu Lamaran reconciled to Datu Panayangan to settle the swampy place of Piso which later was called Barrio Pongoton from the word pangotanan which means "a place of abundance of fish and crabs to catch".
Until now, the grandsons or the clans of Datu Panayangan and Datu Lamaran are still living on the areas that divide into many families.


=== Second World War ===
At the time of Japanese occupation, Banaybanay (formerly known as Piso) was an important location for the Japanese in the Second World War due to its strategic location in the Davao Gulf. The Japanese established a camp called Piso Camp in Barangay Calubihan.
