Eastleigh railway station serves the town of Eastleigh in the county of Hampshire in England. It is located on the South Western Main Line and is the junction station for two other routes, the Eastleigh-Fareham Line and the Eastleigh-Romsey Line. It is 73 miles 35 chains (118.2 km) from London Waterloo. South of the station are Eastleigh Railway Works and Eastleigh Depot.


== History ==
The station was built by the LSWR and was called Bishopstoke when it was opened in 1839. The station-house was designed by Sir William Tite.  It was renamed Bishopstoke Junction in 1852 (the branch to Fareham and Gosport having opened in 1841), Eastleigh and Bishopstoke in 1889, and finally Eastleigh Station in 1923.
The station has been a busy and important junction throughout its life, having gained a second branch line to Salisbury via Romsey in 1847 and a large carriage & wagon repair shops (later to become Eastleigh Works) in 1891.  The main Waterloo to Bournemouth line was electrified in 1967, but the Romsey line closed to passenger traffic two years later in May 1969.  The Portsmouth line remained diesel worked until 1990, but was then added to the electrified network.  Passenger services over the line to Romsey restarted in 2003 - this line remains the only diesel-worked route of those in the area.
In 2015 the forecourt of the station received major improvements at a cost of Â£500,000


== Accidents and Incidents ==
On 28 January 2020, a freight train derailed whilst moving at a slow speed just outside the station. It caused major structural damage to the tracks and disruption for several days across the whole South Western Main Line between Southampton Central and Basingstoke. Delays lasted well into February.
