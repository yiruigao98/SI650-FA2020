Bondo (formerly Djabir) is a town in north-central Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Bas-Uele Province, about 200 km north-west of Buta. Bondo lies mainly on the north bank of the Uele River. As of 2009 it had an estimated population of 19,601.A branch line of the now-defunct Vicicongo narrow gauge railway terminates on the south bank. The railway branch line from Aketi was made by the Belgian state in 1920.
The town has a 1300m airstrip, but is relatively inaccessible by other means as it is served only by earth tracks impassable after heavy rain. 
River crossings on Uele is made by canoes. Navigation on the Uele is restricted by cataracts.
Bondo is a base for reaching the Bili Forest lying on an earth track going east from the town. The Bili chimpanzee found in the forest has in the past been called the 'Bondo Mystery Ape'.
