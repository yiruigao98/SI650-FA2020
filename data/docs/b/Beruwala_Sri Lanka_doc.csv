Beruwala (Sinhala:බේරුවල Tamil: பேருவளை ) is a town in Kalutara District, Western Province, Sri Lanka, governed by an Urban Council. Beruwala with a total area of approximately 15 square kilometres and is located on the south-west coast of Sri Lanka, 60 km (37 mi) south of Colombo.


== Etymology ==
The name Beruwala is derived from the Sinhalese word for the place where the sail is lowered. It marks the spot for the first Muslim settlement on the island, established by the Somali Sheikh Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn, who converted the people into Islam. The town was originally named Berbereen in honour and respect of the Somali Shaikh. The Chinese also traded here and Beruwala was known to them as Piehlo-li.


== History ==
Beruwala has the first recorded Muslim settlement in Sri Lanka, with records establishing the settlement by Arab traders around the 12th century AD.
Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn is also credited with establishing the first Sri Lankan Muslim settlement. Which marks the spot for the first Muslim settlement on the island, established by the Somali Sheikh Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn, .Beruwela, according to some historians derived its name from two Sinhala words, viz. Be (lower) and Ruwala (sail), which denotes the place where the sails of the Arab merchant vessels were lowered. When the early Arab settlers arrived by sea and on sighting a tiny islet, they, overcome with joy, cried out "Berr..Berr.." to their oarsmen of the catamarans to stop. This island called "Barberyn" adds picturesque atmosphere to the environment to the area in the sea waters in which the Barberyn Light House is currently located.A significant contribution of the Arabs in Sri Lanka, the Unani medicine system, found its way to this country through Beruwela. Tradition has it that in the 10th century, Prince Jamal-ud-din, the son of the Sultan of Konya (in Asia Minor) arrived here and practised Unani medicine. Many Unani physicians have had the honor to serve the Kings in the palace at that time. For instance, Muhandiram Mohamed Odeyar who belonged to the famous Behethge clan, served as a physician to the Kandyan monarchs and even the Princes of Maldives sailed to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) for treatment from the Unani physicians.Although the Unani medicine practice has declined significantly in Sri Lanka, quite a number of them could still be found practicing in various parts of the country, including in Beruwela. The grandfather of former Speaker of Parliament, Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar was an established Unani physician of the area. Muslims used the term "Hakeem" when referring to a physician, which means literally a person of wisdom in Arabic. The 'Hakeem Villa' in Beruwala still stands as a monument to this family of Physicians.The great philanthropist Alhaj M. I. M. Naleem, who rose to prominence through the gem trade, contributed much for the development of Islamic culture and tradition, the founding of the Islamic Institute, Jamiya Naleemiya  being one of them, following the footsteps of his distinguished immediate predecessors such as Alhaj N. D. H. Abdul Cafoor and E. L. Ibrahim Hajiar also known as "Rubber King" who have donated their wealth for the development of education and for the welfare of the disabled and orphans in Beruwala.Beruwela has also produced a Muslim Ruler by the name of "Vathimi Raja" who reigned in Kurunegala for a brief period during the 14th century. He was the son of Buvanekabahu I, by a Muslim spouse from Beruwela. He is still remembered by the people of Kurunegala as Vathimi Deiyo or Gale Bandara Deiyo. There is also a Vattimirajapura Housing Scheme, which was fittingly opened by the late Alhaj M. A. Bakeer Markar and appropriately named in remembrance of the King Vathimi. As destined, when he was then Speaker, Alhaj M. A. Bakeer Markar too was the Acting Head of Sri Lanka for a brief period in 1981, when then President J. R. Jayewardene and Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa left for England to attend a Royal Ceremony.
