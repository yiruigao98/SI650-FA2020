== History ==
Boardman was homesteaded in 1903 by Samuel Herbert Boardman,  the first superintendent of the Oregon State Parks System.  Boardman and his wife worked for 13 years to develop irrigation for their land; during those years his wife taught school, and Boardman at times worked on railroad construction projects. The Union Pacific Railroad passed through Boardman, where it had a station. The community was platted in 1916 at about the same time Samuel Boardman went to work for the Oregon State Highway Department and became involved in the development of roadside parks.The Boardman post office opened in 1916. The city was incorporated in 1921. During construction of the John Day Dam on the Columbia River in the 1960s, the city had to be moved south, further from the water. Lake Umatilla, behind the dam, covered much of the original city.South of Boardman, the U.S. Army Air Force established a training range in 1941. The Air Force transferred ownership of the range in 1960 to the U.S. Navy and it is now known as the Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility Boardman. The range is largely used by NAS Whidbey Island and the Oregon National Guard.

The Port of Morrow, Oregon's second-largest port, is adjacent to the city and located on the Columbia Riverfront. The port property also includes two (PGE) gas-fired power plants. PGE also has a coal-fired power plant in the Boardman area; opened in 1980, it is scheduled to be shut down by 2020. The Umatilla Chemical Depot, which includes the Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, is 10 miles (16 km) east of the city, northwest of the intersection of I-84 and Interstate 82. Seven miles east of Boardman is the Irrigon Fish Hatchery. Three Mile Canyon Farms is the largest farm located In Boardman.
According to a November 2008 article in The Oregonian, a "huge data center linked to Amazon.com [was] under construction" at the 9,000-acre (36 km2) Port of Morrow.  The data center was to have a dedicated 10-megawatt electrical substation. A website focused on data centers suggested the Boardman site was created in response to the rapid growth of Amazon Web Services; earlier in 2008, Amazon had announced that Amazon S3 was storing 29 billion objects (such as IMDb tables). The project made Boardman the second Oregon city along the Columbia River to host a power-hungry data center for web services: Google has a similar center in The Dalles. By 2012, Apple had announced plans for a server farm south of The Dalles in Prineville, where Facebook already had a similar farm. Rackspace was said to be considering  a data center at the Port of Morrow.  According to an August 2018 article in the East Oregonian, Amazon has two data centers in Boardman and one in Umatilla and is proposing to build four more data centers in the region. The three data centers in Boardman and Umatilla correspond to the three availability zones in AWS US-West-2 (Oregon) region.
Since 2007, Pacific Ethanol has operated an ethanol plant in Boardman. It can produce up to 40 million US gallons (150,000,000 L) of ethanol a year from grains. ZeaChem has built a demonstration biorefinery at the Port of Morrow with a capacity of up to 250,000 US gallons (950,000 L) of ethanol a year from wood waste. The company hopes to build a much larger commercial refinery with a capacity of 25 million US gallons (95,000,000 L) annually. However, in April 2013, less than a month after start-up at the demonstration plant, ZeaChem halted production, citing funding problems. The company plans to resume production if financial backing can be found.


=== Coal export ===
Ambre Energy, a company based in Australia, has proposed using the Port of Morrow as a transfer point for shipping U.S. coal to Asia. Ambre wants to export up to 8.8 million short tons (8,000,000 t) of coal per year from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. It would ship the coal by train to Boardman, where it would be loaded on barges and hauled down the Columbia River to the Port of St. Helens. There it would be transferred to ocean-going ships headed for China, South Korea, Japan, and other Asian countries.The Ambre plan has generated controversy among proponents touting economic benefits and opponents fearing environmental damage. After the public-comment period ends on August 12, 2013, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality will decide whether to grant Ambre's request for permits to proceed. To export coal across Oregon in the way Ambre proposes, the company will also need approval from the Oregon Department of State Lands and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
