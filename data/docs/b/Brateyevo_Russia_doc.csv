== History ==
Several pagan mounds dated back to ancient settlements have been discovered on the territory of Brateyevo District. The settlement transformed into the prosperous village located on the Brateyevo hill which later gave its name to the district. There are two common versions of origin the name of the village. According to one, the name the toponym "Brateyevo" came from the personal name "Bratey". According to another version, in the 16th century the nearest villages (Borisovo and Besedy) belonged to the Godunov family, while Brateyevo himself was owned by Boris Godunov’s brother (Russian: брат), Semyon.
In 1960 Brateyevo village became administrative part of Moscow. In the 1980s Brateyevo village has been demolished during the construction of the modern district.
