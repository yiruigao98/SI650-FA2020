Bountiful is a city in Davis County, Utah, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 42,552, a three percent increase over the 2000 figure of 41,301. The city grew rapidly during the suburb growth of the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s and was Davis County's largest city until 1985 when it was surpassed by Layton. Bountiful is Utah's 15th largest city.
Although a part of the Ogden-Clearfield Metropolitan Statistical Area, it serves as a bedroom community to Salt Lake City and the surrounding area. However, due to the very narrow entrance into Salt Lake County, roads between the counties often reach near-gridlock traffic during rush hour. The FrontRunner commuter rail has been running since April 2008, and the Legacy Parkway was opened on September 13, 2008. These were built to help alleviate the traffic load on Interstate 15 through the Bountiful area.


== History ==

Bountiful was settled on September 27, 1847, by Perrigrine Sessions and his family. It was Utah's second settlement after Salt Lake City. It was known as both Sessions Settlement and North Canyon Ward before being named Bountiful in 1855. This city was so named both because of the city's reputation as a great place for gardening, and because "Bountiful" is the name of a city in the Book of Mormon (Alma 52:9). Most of the settlers, and also many of the present inhabitants, are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). The city also shares 14 other religious institutions including a Catholic school and church, Saint Olaf School, established in 1959. The Bountiful Utah Temple was dedicated in 1995 by the LDS Church.  A tabernacle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is also located in Bountiful.

Bountiful Handcart Days is a volunteer–driven event.
