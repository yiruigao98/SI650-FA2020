Bergschenhoek ([ˌbɛrxsə(n)ˈɦuk] (listen)) is a town and former municipality in the Netherlands. It is situated roughly 10 km to the north of Rotterdam in the province of South Holland. The town had a population of 18,475 in 2019, and covered an area of 15.52 km² (5.99 mile²) of which 0.63 km² (0.24 mile²) is water. On 1 January 2007, the town was merged with neighbouring towns Berkel en Rodenrijs and Bleiswijk to form the new municipality Lansingerland; these three towns collectively are known locally as the "3B Hoek".
Due to the continuing influx of people to Bergschenhoek, it is in a constant state of expansion and is now predominantly a commuter town as most of its residents work in the neighbouring cities, such as The Hague and Rotterdam. The town had a large population increase since 1990, because of the Vinex-plans. The town grew from 7,600 inhabitants in 1990 to nearly 18,500 in 2019. 
The name of the town is derived from a district of the nearby city of Rotterdam, Hillegersberg. There was a road leading to this municipality. On a corner of this road ('hoek' in Dutch) a settlement grew, leading to a village. This village was named after Hillegersberg, and the corner was incorporated in the name, hence the name (Hillegers)Bergschenhoek.
