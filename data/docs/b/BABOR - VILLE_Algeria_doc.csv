Cities are a major topic for popular songs.
Music journalist and author Nick Coleman has gone as far as to say that apart from love, "pop is better on cities than anything else."Popular music often treats cities positively, though sometimes they are portrayed as places of danger and temptation. In many cases, songs celebrate individual cities, presenting them as exciting and liberating. Not all genres share the tendency to be positive about cities; in Country music cities are often portrayed as unfriendly and dehumanizing, or seductive but full of sin. However, there are many exceptions, for example: Lady Antebellum's song ‘This City’, Danielle Bradbery's ‘Young in America’, and many others.
Lyricist and author Sheila Davis writes that including a city in a song's title helps focus the song on the concrete and specific, which is both more appealing and more likely to lead to universal truth than abstract generalizations. Davis also says that songs with titles concerning cities and other specific places often have enduring popularity.The following is a list of songs about cities, from both traditional and pop music: the list should not be considered complete.
