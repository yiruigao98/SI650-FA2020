Buzen Province (豊前国, Buzen no kuni) was an old province of Japan in northern Kyūshū in the area of Fukuoka Prefecture and Ōita Prefecture. It was sometimes called Hōshū (豊州), with Bungo Province. Buzen bordered on Bungo and Chikuzen Provinces.


== History ==
The ruins of the ancient capital of the province were found near Toyotsu, Fukuoka. The castle town of Kokura was also in Buzen, and a seat of many feudal rulers.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures.  Maps of Japan and Buzen Province were reformed in the 1870s.After the abolition of the clan system in 1871 Buzen Province became Kokura Prefecture for four years until it was absorbed by Fukuoka Prefecture in 1876.  At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes.  For example, Buzen is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.
