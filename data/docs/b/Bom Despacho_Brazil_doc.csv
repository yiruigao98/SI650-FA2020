== History of Immigration ==
The city of Bom Despacho has seen a significant influx of German settlers in the 1920s, however, their tradition has vanished and their history is almost forgotten.
Due to the efforts of the Brazilian politician Faustino Assunção the city of Bom Despacho was chosen to participate in the settlement program initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture during the Bernardes government.
(President of the state of Minas Gerais from 1918–1922 and president of Brazil 1922-1926) The aim of this program was to attract European settlers to cultivate the soil surrounding Bom Despacho.
For this purpose, the city provided two large areas of farmland in the direct vicinity of Bom Despacho which were named after Brazilian politicians, Colônia David Campista and Colônia Álvaro da Silveira.
At the beginning of the 1920s settlers from various European countries arrived in several waves.
Most of them were from Germany as the country was in political and economical turmoil after the defeat in World War 1.
The new settlers received agricultural plots, houses, tools, and seeds on a credit basis which they had to pay off from the proceeds of their crop.
The German embassy even established and operated a German school on Colonia David Campista. The school served the  families of both settlements, a known total of at least 54 families.
However, the German immigrants on these two settlements dispersed within the next two decades. Unfrugal soil and tropical diseases let many settlers to abandon their lot quickly and seek work in the big cities, such as Belo Horzionte.
Some German families even returned to Germany.
When  Brazil joined World War 2 on the side of the Allies in 1942, the German school was closed and it was forbidden to even speak German.
As a result, many more settlers left their plots.
Today, there are only very few descendants of the original German settlers still living on Colonia David Campista and on Colonia Alvaro Da Silveira.
However, some of them still speak German.
The cemetery belonging to the two farmlands is called German cemetery by the locals. Its official inscription on the gate reads Imigrantes da Colonia.
