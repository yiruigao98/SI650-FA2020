Bhadrapur is one of Nepal's oldest municipality. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census, it had a population of 50249. Bhadrapur Airport has flights to Kathmandu. This airport is the best way to reach Kathmandu from eastern part of Nepal and India (i.e., West Bengal, Sikkim).
Bhadrapur is one of the most multi-cultural city of Nepal. In this city, people from all the districts from Nepal, and people who were migrated from India, Bhutan and Bangladesh are living. Different ethnic background people like rajbanshi, dhimal mechee, bramahan, chetri, rai, limbu, sherpa, tamang, madbadi, bengali, muslim etc are living in Bhadrapur by maintaining a cordial relation, peace and harmony among the people. Bhadrapur is the "tea city" of Nepal. It is a starting point for tourist attractions. A few hours ride north takes one close to the Himalayas. There are good roads up to a height of around 3700 meters.
Bhadrapur has important governmental and other important infrastructures, including a zonal hospital, airport, Mechi Multiple campus, different schools, Mahendra park, stadium police and military headquarters, and hosts the Central District Offices.
However, due to the construction of the Mahendra Highway or East West Highway (north of Bhadrapur), economic activities have shifted north to the junction of the highway Birtamod. This has left Bhadrapur with a receding population and crippled its once-booming economic activity.
In the last decade, Bhadrapur has slowly transformed itself into a tea hub with new plantations and tea factories being established every year. The much-awaited Mechi Bridge joining Bhadrapur to India (Galgalia) is  constructed now and acts as a lifeline to the revitalization of Bhadrapur as well as the far eastern part of Nepal. There is a checkpoint at the border. 


== History ==
Bhadrapur was a very prosperous city during the early 1900s. It was renowned for its rice cultivation due to its rich fertile soil. This period saw rice mills being established. The prosperous rice business led Bhadrapur to its most prosperous period. However, now Bhadrapur transformed as a major city of tea factories and old rice mills are not operating anymore.


== Industries ==
Bhadrapur is home to Momento Apparels, which was one of Nepal's largest exporters of ready-made garments. The factory has been forced out of operation since 2012. In its heyday, the factory had a workforce of 2,000, and supplied ready-made garments to the US (including retail outlets such as Walmart and JC Penny) and a number of European countries.
