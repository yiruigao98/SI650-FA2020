== History ==
 
Brownsburg was first settled in 1824 by James B. Brown. When he arrived, the area was a dense, unbroken stretch of wilderness. Delaware Indians lived in what is now called Lincoln Township, along White Lick Creek, which was then called "Wa-pe-ke-way" or "White Salt".
Four years later, the first log schoolhouse built in Brown Township. Once a stagecoach line was established along a road built in 1820 connecting to Indianapolis, more settlers arrived. William Harris settled in the area north of what is now Main Street, selling sections of woods to incoming pioneers which gave the town its original name of Harrisburg in 1835. A post office was established in 1836 under the name of Harrisburg, but was later changed to Brownsburg since the name Harrisburg was being used by a post office in another Indiana county. 
Brownsburg tripled in size from 1840 to 1870, increased from six to sixteen acres, and added its first church. The town's first election was held in 1848. In 1863, it was divided into Brown Township and Lincoln Township.In 1985, part of the movie Hoosiers was filmed in the former College Avenue Gym.
