Considered to be the industrial capital of Nepal, the city is also the birthplace of five prime ministers of Nepal, in addition to being host to a number of revolutionary incidents in the country including the first labor strike which led to the anti-Rana movements.


== History ==
The old name of Biratnagar was Gograha Bazaar. The ruins of temples, palaces and ponds are scattered in a vast area to the south of the current city, in Vedhyari, Buddhanagar. The preservation of these heritages have been a major problem citing the encroachment by newcomers into the city. In 1914, Colonel Jit Bahadur Khatri, the then district governor, laid the foundations of modern Biratnagar by moving the hospital, post office, prison and the customs, land registry, forestry and auditor offices to Gograha Bazaar from Rangeli, the then district capital of Morang. The town was named Biratnagar in 1919 (1976 BS) by Keshar Shamsher Rana after ruins of a palace, thought to be of King Virat, and other objects of historical importance were found. The ruins of the palace along with stone carved tools, idols, and household objects can be seen preserved to the south of Biratnagar, close to the border. In Nepali, Birat (Nepali: विराट) means "Huge" and Nagar (Nepali: नगर) means "City".
On 4 March 1947, the first anti-Rana movement in Nepal started in Biratnagar at the Biratnagar jute mills under the leadership of Girija Prasad Koirala and B. P. Koirala. This sparked a countrywide anti-Rana demonstration that eventually led to the abolishment of Rana rule in Nepal.

This event is termed the Rath Yatra (Nepali: रथ यात्रा). It is the largest such procession in Nepal and the second largest in Asia. It is believed that the Rath was driven by Lord Krishna himself. So, a young child is placed in the chariot as a symbol of Krishna and is taken around the city with joy to celebrate Lord Krishna's birthday. Some people stay on top of the Rath to distribute prasad (holy offerings) to numerous devotees observing the holy procession. The Rath is followed by many smaller carts pulled by oxen. People in the smaller carts play music and sing hymns of joy and happiness.
