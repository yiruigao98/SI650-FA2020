== Geography ==
Bad Segeberg is not far from the eastern edge of the hills of Ostholstein. The western part of the city is bordered by the Trave, the northern part by the Ihlsee and forests, the northeast is bordered by the Großer Segeberger See, and the west is also bordered by forests. In the south, Bad Segeberg is bordered by the towns of Högersdorf and Klein Gladebrügge.
Geologically, the area around Bad Segeberg is unique because it is the only area with Karst topography in Schleswig-Holstein, which is indicated by the presence of sinkholes in the area. There were even sinkholes in the city itself, although these have all been filled in and are no longer visible. The only exception is the Kleiner Segeberger See, which is a sinkhole that is filled with water at the foot of the Segeberger Kalkberg.
