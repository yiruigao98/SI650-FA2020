Sint-Job-in-'t-Goor (Dutch pronunciation: [sɪnˌcɔpɪnətˈxoːr]) is a village in the municipality of Brecht in the province of Antwerp, Belgium. Sint-Job-in-'t-Goor has 8,019 inhabitants (2011).


== History ==
The location of Sint-Job was already mentioned in the 13th century, and was originally centered around a chapel dedicated to the biblical prophet Job. Initially, the chapel fell under the parish of Schoten, until it was separated from it in the 16th century. During this time, Sint-Job and Schoten formed a part of the Archdiocese of Cambrai, while neighboring Brecht fell under the Diocese of Liège.On September 25, 1908, aviation pioneer baron de Caters was the first Belgian to fly an aircraft by taking off with his plane over the fields south of the village. Soon after, de Caters started the construction of the first airfield and pilot training school in Belgium at Sint-Job. Presently, the airfield has completely disappeared, but the local neighborhood is still called de vliegplein in reference to the airfield. Another famous Belgian pioneer, Jan Olieslagers, was also active in Sint-Job, but later contributed to the construction of the airport of Antwerp in Deurne.During the Second World War, Sint-Job suffered heavily under days of harsh fighting in late September 1944, when Canadian and British troops tried to secure an undamaged bridge over the Turnhout-Schoten Canal on September 23. However, the offensive failed after the allied troops met fierce German resistance and were unable to prevent the enemy from blowing up the bridge. Sint-Job was only liberated on October 2, more than a week later, after the allied forces had captured the bridges at Rijkevorsel and Sint-Leaarts, further north, on September 28.In the first half of the 20th century, Sint-Job also was popular green vacation resort for the wealthier inhabitants of Antwerp, who came enjoy their weekends in the village, away from the bustle of the city. Several campings along the canal, as well as the now protected nature domain the Brechtse Heide are still witnesses of this period today.
During the meeting of the municipal council on November 15, 1972, the idea of a fusion of the municipality of Sint-Job with the neighboring municipality of either Schoten, Brecht or 's-Gravenwezel was mentioned and discussed for the first time. Eventually, Sint-Job was included in the municipality of Brecht in 1977, at the same time as the village of Sint-Lennaarts did the same.

The gothic Heilige Man Job ("Holy man Job") church dates back from 1511 and is more than 500 years old. The two aisles were built in the 19th century. In May 1940, the church was heavily damaged by troops of the retreating Belgian army, who blew up the tower to prevent the Germans from using it as a lookout post. After the war, the tower was rebuilt in contemporary style.

== Mobility ==
Sint-Job is intersected by the Dessel–Turnhout–Schoten Canal
The N115 national road connects Antwerp with Brecht and Hoogstraten and forms a main axis running through Sint-Job. The road runs through the village from the southwest to the northeast, parallel to the Antwerp-Turnhout canal.
Just north of the village lies a highway ramp, providing access to the E19 connecting Antwerp with Breda in the Netherlands. Since the 90s, the highway ramp has become the site of numerous accidents, and frequently, traffic jams during the morning rush hour in Antwerp begin near Sint-Job.
The HSL 4 high speed train line, running parallel to the E19, runs past the village, but there is no station available in Sint-Job.
Sint-Job is also serviced by multiple bus routes operated by the Flemish transport company De Lijn. Bus connections are available to Antwerp to the south, both over the N115 via Schoten and the E19 highway, Sint-Antonius to the east, Maria-ter-Heide to the west and Brecht, and the Noorderkempen to the north.
