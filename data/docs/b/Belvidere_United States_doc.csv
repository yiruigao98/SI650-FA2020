== History ==

The location where Belvidere exists today was first settled in 1835 by Simon P. Doty and Daniel Hilton 
Whitney, who named the location next to the Kishwaukee River "Elysian Fields". Many residents could not pronounce or spell the proposed name, so the city was named after Belvidere, Virginia, the former home of major financial founder Ebenezer Polk, a railroad lawyer.  Belvidere was originally built on the north side of the river.  In 1851 the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was built south of the river, the business section followed to the south side of the river, where Belvidere's downtown is now located. Belvidere was home to the National Sewing Machine Company from 1886 until the 1940s. In 1906, former female sheriff Sarah Ames moved to South Dakota and named the area where she settled after her home town.  Belvidere, South Dakota is still operational as a small town in Jackson County.


=== 1967 tornado ===

On April 21, 1967, a devastating tornado struck Belvidere. Twenty-four lives were lost in the tornado, many of whom were schoolchildren.  The F4 tornado struck at the end of the school day of Belvidere High School, while many children including those that attended area grade schools were waiting on school buses outside the high school.  Out of sixteen school buses outside the high school, twelve were overturned or thrown.  The tornado did $22 million in damage, demolished over 100 homes, and injured 500 people. In 2007 a statue was erected in front of Belvidere High School in memorial of the lives lost.


=== 2009 explosion ===
On December 7, 2009 there was an explosion at the NDK America building. A truck driver from Indiana at the nearby Illinois Tollway Commission-owned Belvidere Oasis was killed by flying debris. The explosion's shock wave shook ceilings and doors in the area. The cause was found to be corrosion of the iron pressure vessels used in NDK's quartz crystallization process by high pressure sodium hydroxide inside the vessels, causing a catastrophic failure.
