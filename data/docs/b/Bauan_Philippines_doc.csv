== History ==


=== Religious attribution and miracles ===

The Augustinian church of Bauan was founded as a visita (small chapel without a resident priest) in 1590 on the slopes of Mount Macolod, along Taal Lake's southern shore.  The resident priest of Taal, Father Diego de Avila would visit periodically and attend to the spiritual needs of the settlement.Five years after the establishment of the ecclesiastical mission of Bauan, a giant cross made of anubing was found in a Diñgin (a place of worship) near the town of Alitagtag. In 1790, Castro y Amoedo found a Tagalog document in the Bauan Cathedral Archives, signed by 25 Indio elders, stating the cross was made around 1595, as protection from ghosts surrounding the Tolo fountain.  Subsequent miracles were associated with this cross.  On 3 May, the 2.5 m tall cross was brought to the Chapel of Alitagtag.  A golden sun, with a human face, and radiating rays was added, while the devout would cut away pieces of the cross to make talisman replicas.  The elders also thought the cross protected the town from pestilence, locusts, drought, volcanic eruptions, and Moro pirates.Today, the traditional folk dance of Bauan, subli, is a religious homage to the Cross of Alitagtag.   The dance is performed at a sambahan (place of worship), two of which are natural grottos along the shore of Taal Lake, and one of which is called Diñgin.Bauan became an independent parish on 12 May 1596, but was re-annexed to Taal, its matriz (mother town), because of too few tributos (taxpayers).  Due to Taal Volcano eruptions, the town moved to Durungao (lookout point), led by Father Jose Rodriguez, in 1662.  The town moved again in 1671 to Loual, along Taal's Seno de Bauan.  An earthquake struck the town in 1677.  In 1689, Father Nicolas de Rivera helped the town build its third church.  In 1690, Father Rivera, with the help of the Taal parish priest Father Simon Martinez, moved the town to the seaside, its present location.  However, a typhoon destroyed the church in 1692.A fourth stone church was built from 1695 to 1710.  The current church was built in 1762 by Father Jose Victoria and Don Juan Bandino.  A fort was built in 1775 to protect the town from Moro raids.Fr. Jose Vitoria introduced the cultivation of indigo in Bauan while building the present church.  This was continued until 1856 during the administrations of Fr. Jose Trevino and Fr. Hipolito Huerta. It was completed under the supervision of Fr. Felipe Bravo  in 1881. From there until 1894, final decorations were supervised by Fr. Moises Santos and Fr. Felipe Garcia. The church is said to be the most artistically built in the province of Batangas during that time. Father Bravo was also an imminent botanist who put up a museum of natural history and collected rare books that were lost when the church was razed by fire during the Philippine revolution against Spain in 1898. The church was probably rebuilt and again destroyed by fire in 1938. It has been restored since then.

In March 2019, the Black Nazarene visited the church to help funds for rebuilding after the church was damaged in the 2017 Batangas earthquakes.
The town of Bauan used to encompass a much more extensive area. However, throughout history, chunks of Bauan have been converted into municipalities; San Jose in 1765, San Luis in 1861, Alitagtag in 1901, Mabini in 1918, and San Pascual in 1969.
