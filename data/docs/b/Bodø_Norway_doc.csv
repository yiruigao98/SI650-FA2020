Some of the notable villages in Bodø include Misvær, Skjerstad, Saltstraumen, Løding, Løpsmarka, Kjerringøy, Sørvær, and Fenes.

== History ==

The village of Bodø was granted township status in 1816 and soon after, in 1818, it was known for the Bodø affair, smuggling by British merchants that later were compensated by Norway.  The town of Bodø was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).  On 1 January 1938, a part of the neighboring municipality of Bodin (population: 559) was transferred into the town of Bodø.  On 1 January 1959, another part of Bodin (population: 1,303) was transferred into Bodø.
During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.  On 1 January 1968, the town of Bodø (population: 14,252) was merged with the municipality of Bodin (population: 13,323) and this created the much larger Bodø Municipality.  On 1 January 1984, the Tårnvika and Øygården areas (population: 22) northeast of the village of Kjerringøy in Sørfold Municipality was transferred to Bodø.  On 1 January 2005, the entire municipality of Skjerstad was merged into the municipality of Bodø.


=== World War II ===
Most of the town of Bodø was destroyed during a Luftwaffe attack on 27 May 1940. Six thousand people were living in Bodø, and 3500 people lost their homes in the attack. Fifteen people lost their lives during the air attack (two British soldiers and 13 Norwegians).Due to the acute lack of housing, the Swedish Government helped build 107 apartments in the winter of 1941. These houses were built tightly together just outside the town. This small area, today in the heart of Bodø, is still called Svenskebyen ("the Swedish Town").  The town was subsequently rebuilt after the war. The rebuilding ended in 1959 with the completion of the new town hall.  German shipping in and around Bodø was attacked in October 1943 in Operation Leader.


=== Toponymy ===
The municipality is named after the old Bodøgård farm (Old Norse: Boðvin), since the town was built on its ground.  The first element might be boði which means "sunken rock" or "skerry" and the last element is vin which means "meadow" or "pasture".  The last element may have been misunderstood as øy which means "island" (and written with the Danish language form ø).


=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms was granted on 24 July 1959. The arms show a yellow sun on a red background.  The arms are a representation of the midnight sun and they are a simplified version of the old arms from 1889 which showed a sun above a boat with mountains in the background.


== Geography ==

The municipality lies just north of the Arctic Circle where the midnight sun is visible from 1 June to 13 July. Due to atmospheric refraction, there is no true polar night in Bodø, but because of the mountains south of Bodø, the sun is not visible in parts of the municipality from early December to early January. The average number of sun-hours in Bodø is highest in June with 221 hours.Amongst the strongest tidal currents in the world, with water speeds reaching 22 knots (41 km/h; 25 mph), is Saltstraumen, situated about 30 kilometres (19 mi) southeast of Bodø. The village of Kjerringøy is a well preserved old trading village on the coast about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of the town of Bodø. With its scenic setting and authentic buildings, several movies have been shot at this little port, including Benoni og Rosa (based on Knut Hamsun's novel), I am Dina, and Telegrafisten.
Skjerstad Fjord in the eastern part of Bodø passes through the Saltstraumen into the Saltfjorden.  The Saltfjorden then flows west into the Vestfjorden.  Lakes in the region include Fjærvatnet, Gjømmervatnet, Heggmovatnet, Soløyvatnet, Valnesvatnet, and Vatnvatnet.
There are also several islands and island groups in Bodø. The islands of Straumøya and Knaplundsøya are in the Saltfjorden.  Several bridges connect these islands to the mainland: Åselistraumen Bridge, Indre Sunnan Bridge, and Saltstraumen Bridge. The islands of Landegode, Helligvær, Bliksvær, and Karlsøyvær all lie in the Vestfjorden.  Several lighthouses are also located out in the Vestfjorden: Bjørnøy Lighthouse, Grytøy Lighthouse, Landegode Lighthouse, Nyholmen Lighthouse, and Tennholmen Lighthouse.


=== Climate ===
Located on a peninsula in the Norwegian Sea, the town of Bodø is one of Norway's windiest cities. Despite its location just north of the Arctic Circle, Bodø features a Subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc), with chilly (but not cold) winters and cool summers. Snow cover during winter varies and is often sparse in the city center, but only slightly inland the snow cover is much more reliable. The "midnight sun" is above the horizon from 1 June to 14 July (44 days), and the period with continuous daylight lasts a bit longer.
The all-time low was recorded in February 1966, which was the coldest month on record with a mean of −8.9 °C (16.0 °F). The all-time high was recorded in July 2019, while July 2014 was the warmest month on record with a 24-hr mean of 17.3 °C (63.1 °F). Recent decades have seen warming, and there has been no overnight air frost in June since 1981. However, in spite of this, summer afternoons are still cooler than in lower areas of the interior across the Swedish border such as the nearest inland town of Gällivare. In winter, Bodø instead is averaging more than 12 °C (22 °F) milder than said areas. Under the Köppen Climate Classification Bodø sits on the border between "Cfb" (Oceanic) and "Cfc" (Subpolar Oceanic Climate); with its location on the Arctic Circle the city features one of the largest latitudinal temperature anomalies on Earth. Data in table below is from Bodø Airport, summer daily highs are often warmer in the city center. 


=== Nature ===

Besides Saltstraumen, the municipality of Bodø has much wilderness for hikers. About 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) north of the town of Bodø lies the popular recreation area Geitvågen. The area is inhabited by a large number of white-tailed eagles. Sjunkhatten National Park is partly located in Bodø municipality, and there are also 17 nature reserves. Sundstraumlian nature reserve has undisturbed mixed forest with marble bedrock, Skånland with coastal pine forest, Børvatnet protecting a birch forest with many orchids, and Bliksvær nature reserve with well-preserved coastal nature of many types and a rich bird life, making it a Ramsar site as well.

Bodø has a long history with the Norwegian Armed Forces, and especially the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF). The Norwegian Armed Forces Joint Operational Headquarters are located at Reitan, east of Bodø. Parts of NATO air forces attending the annual Cold Response are stationed at Bodø Main Air Station. Bodø MAS is a major Norwegian military air base, housing two-thirds of Norway's F-16 fighter force and two of RNoAFs SAR Sea Kings. Bodø, competing with Ørland and Evenes, is a candidate for the Northern Air Base in the new RNoAF system.
Bodin Leir located near the air station was an RNoAF recruit school including Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System personnel and a national response unit. The base was central during the Cold War due to its strategic location and proximity to the Soviet Union. It would have been vital in the build-up of NATO air and land forces to defend Norway, and thus the entire northern flank of NATO, in a war with the Warsaw Pact. It could also have been used as a forward base for American bombers to strike targets in the Soviet Union. Now Bodin Leir is an camp to house military personnel for The Norwegian Joint Headquarters and Bodø Main Air Station.
Bodø has a street named General Fleischer's Gate in honour of Carl Gustav Fleischer.
