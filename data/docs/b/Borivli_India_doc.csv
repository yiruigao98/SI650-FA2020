== History ==
Borivali has developed from what was once a congregate region of smaller towns namely; Eksar, Poisar, Vazira, Shimpoli, Mandpeshwar, Kanheri, Tulsi, Magathane and Gorai, which were situated on and around Mount Poinsur, between the Dahisar River and Poisar River.
It is believed that the name "Borivali" comes from the existence of a lot of bushes of a sweet fruit called "borr (Marathi) meaning "berries" in English. Hence, the name means the town of berries literally "bori-vali".  The existence of the ancient temple of Lord Ganesha "Shree Svayambhu Ganpati Devalaya" in Vazira Naka area, meaning the "self-manifested" or the one that is created from its own accord in Hinduism.
The pre-historic era's "Mandpeshwar" (“An 8th Century remains of a beautiful Edifice structure, Mandapeshwar caves is a rock cut architecture and a Hindu shrine of lord Shiva located near Borivali IC Colony, at walking distance from Dahisar Railway Station”) and "Kanheri caves" stand testament to the rich history of this place. Borivali was spelt "Berewlee" by the then ruled India under the British Raj Era. It is also spelt and pronounced as "Borivli".
Borivali is densely populated but continues to retain some  green cover due to the presence of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, previously known as the "Borivali National Park" in the east and the mangroves in the west end of Borivali.
