== History ==
On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, a small part of the commune of Bagnolet was annexed to the city of Paris. At the same time, the commune of Charonne was disbanded and divided between the city of Paris, Bagnolet, and Montreuil. Bagnolet received a small part of the territory of Charonne.
On 24 July 1867, a part of the territory of Bagnolet was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Romainville and a part of the territory of Pantin to create the commune of Les Lilas.

== Support for Georges Ibrahim Abdallah ==
In December 2013, the city's council voted to make Georges Ibrahim Abdallah an "honorary resident." The city council's motion (which did not mention Abdallah's role in the murder of Charles R. Ray) described him as a “communist activist” and a “political prisoner” who “belongs to the resistance movement of Lebanon" and is a "determined defender of the Palestinian just cause." The motion stated that Abdallah's release was being denied “primarily because of the intervention of the US government" and "To call for his liberation, the municipal council declares him an honorary citizen of Bagnolet."In July 2014, the administrative court in Montreuil revoked the city's motion to grant Abdallah honorary citizenship.
