Bonnie is a Scottish given name for either girls or boys, and is sometimes used as a descriptive reference. It comes from the Scots language word "bonnie" (pretty, attractive), or the French bonne (good). That is in turn derived from the Latin word "bonus" (good). The name can also be used as a pet form of Bonita.
