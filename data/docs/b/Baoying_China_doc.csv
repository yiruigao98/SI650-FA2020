=== Etymology ===
Baoying was known as Anyi of Chu zhou (Chu prefecture, 楚州), where supposedly the divine treasures were found in 762. As auspicious tributes, they were presented to the Emperor Suzong of Tang, and found favour with him. It was a coincidence that the then heir apparent, later Emperor Daizong, was the Prince of Chu. The supposed treasures showed the Heaven was sympathetic to the emperor in the future. Thus, the reign title was changed into Baoying (rough meaning: "the treasures show the sympathy [from the Heaven]"), and the county was also bestowed such a name.
