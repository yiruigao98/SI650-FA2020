== Etymology ==
The name of this town according to the legend, came from the name of a plant called "balangbang" (Bauhinia acuminata) which grew in abundance during the early days. "Culibangbang" leaves were used for bulalong Iloko or sinigang. The verdant hills of Bayambang were almost covered by these plants. The people made pickles out of them. As years passed by, these plants became extinct in the vicinity, but the name "Bayambang" which sounds like an echo of the plant's name, was retained and was given to designate this town.
Others believed that the name of the town came from the once numerous "Culibangbang" trees, misunderstood as "Bayambang" by the Spaniards when they first came to this town.Telbang (Bagbag in Ilokano, Dapdap in other dialects, scientific name: Erythrina variegata Linn. var. orientalis, Linn.) was the  original Bayambang according tales. Bayambang is not a tree name, but a plant name: Celosia - Deeringia polysperma (Roxb.) Moq. (as C. polysperma Roxb.).
