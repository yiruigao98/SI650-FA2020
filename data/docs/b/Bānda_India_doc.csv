== Agriculture ==
There are two main crops : Kharif and Rabi; the one between July and October and the other between November and March. The old records in the imperial gazetteer or the district gazetteer mentions cotton as one of the major crops here. But that has vanished now. The main crops grown presently are as follows:
Kharif  : Paddy, jowar, bajra, til, moong, urd, arhar and sanai are the main crops taken these days. Paddy is normally taken as mono crop while others are mixed sown. 100 years ago cotton was taken as a mixed crop along with other crops in Kharif. Presently Government is pushing soybean replacing all other Kharif crops. This tendency ultimately will starve this district.
Rabi : Wheat, barley along with gram, linseed, mustard, masoor and peas are the major crops. There is a tendency for mixed cropping and regional variation in choices of the crops depending upon the geographical situation and the availability of irrigation.
Zaid : the third crops are usually taken in the river beds; that includes Kakri. Tarbooj (water melon), Kharbooja and some vegetables.
