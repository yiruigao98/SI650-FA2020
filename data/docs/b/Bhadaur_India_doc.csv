== History ==

Bhadaur was an independent princely state till 1857, then it was brought under subordination of Patiala by British Govt by a favour not by right. ,Bhadaur is the first joint capital of Phūlkian dynasty founded by Rama 2nd son of Phul. The princely state of Patiala, is rooted to Bhadaur. The family is  Sidhu Jat. Descendants of Chaudhary Phool settled here after conquering the area from muslim invaders, leaving the village of Mehraj, Phul and Dhipali. Ram Singh the son of Chaudhary Phool established the house of Bhadaur for his sons Dunna Singh elder and Ala Singh younger (First Maharaja of Patiala). After spending 17 years in joint family at Bhadaur Ala Singh moved to Barnala then founded the city of Patiala and became first ruler of Patiala Kingdom and Bhadaur state was left to his elder brother Dunna Singh, whose descendants still lives at Bhadaur.
Bhadaur was the only princely town where the royal family held eight residential forts individually. Bhadaur is home to the Phūlkian Sardars, who own and rule 84 villages.
