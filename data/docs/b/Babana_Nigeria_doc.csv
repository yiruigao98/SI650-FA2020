LGBT is legal within Niger on a technicality; it is not mentioned within the country's criminal statutes because most authorities do not believe the concept exists. The country does not have any anti-discrimination laws and there is no clear "queer community". These citizens experience legal and social challenges not experienced by non-LGBT people, for instance their relationships are not legally acknowledged and they can't adopt. While queer people experience discrimination, according to the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s 2010 Human Rights Report there were no known cases of violence against queer people based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
