Bongaigaon ( (listen)) is a major city in the state of Assam, India. The city urban area spans across Bongaigaon and Chirang district. Bongaigaon City also acts as the gateway of North-East Frontier Railway Zone with its New Bongaigaon Junction railway station, second biggest railway station in North-East India. The Asian Development Bank selected the city on their urban planning list of cities from other countries of Asia. Bongaigaon is one of the most populated urban agglomerations in west Assam with line of Guwahati, Jorhat, Dibrugarh and Silchar. Bongaigaon is the administrative headquarters and municipal board of Bongaigaon district.
It was the last capital of the Kamatapur Kingdom and home to many historical monuments of Assamese culture. The city, divided into two parts – Old Bongaigaon and New Bongaigaon - is situated 180 kilometres (112 mi) north west of Guwahati, largest city of Assam. To meet the demands of Bodos of Assam, Bongaigaon was divided up to give way for Chirang district. Bongaigaon has a major petrochemical industry, the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL BGR). The town occupied a place in the map of Indian Railway with the establishment of the railway station in the year 1908. Most of the institutions like ITI, Bongaigaon College, Office of the Assam State Electricity Board in the early 1960s and in fact the very base of the development of the town was laid in this decade only. The development further gained momentum with the establishment of the Bongaigaon Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (BRPL) Complex in the year 1972 at Dhaligaon and also Thermal Power Plant at Salakati. Though these areas are not within the limit of Bongaigaon Municipality the town also caters to the demand of this population.
The Bongaigaon Town Committee was first constituted in the year 1961 and was upgraded to a Municipal Board in the year 1977. Presently the Municipal Area consists of 25 nos. of wards covering an area of 14.31 sq m.
The city today has evolved to be one of the major commercial and business hubs of the state with growing numbers of shopping malls, restaurants, hotels, residential apartments and educational institutions. The city also serves as the base for tourism to places such as the Manas National Park. Centrally located within the state, the city depicts a vibrant Assamese township and culture, making it one of the most preferred places for local people to congregate.

== History ==


=== Creation ===
The decision of the government of Assam was taken in 1989, to create a new district of Bongaigaon, carving out some areas of the Goalpara and Kokrajhar District with its headquarters located at Bongaigaon. On 29 September 1989, the creation of Bongaigaon District was declared by the Government of Assam with its headquarters at Bongaigaon. In 2005, Government of Assam declared Bongaigaon town as a city.


=== Background ===
The original Goalpara district was first created in AD 1822 by David Scott, an employee of East India Company, who was the first Commissioner of newly created North East Rangpur district Hd. Qr. at Rangpur town (now in Bangla Desh) and newly created Goalpara district was also tagged with North-East Rangpur district for administration. The erstwhile Bijni Kingdom's area which included the undivided Garo Hills district area also constituted the original Goalpara district area in 1822. In 1866 Garo Hills was separated from Goalpara district area and in the same year a new district named "Greater Koch Behar" was created and the residual portion of Goalpara district was withdrawn from Rangpur and tagged with Koch Behar. In 1874 a new province named Assam Valley Province was created by the British government (successor of East India Company) and Goalpara district area was withdrawn from Koch Behar and tagged with Assam Province which continues till today unless petty political gambling disturbs. Now the original Goalpara district has given birth to five districts namely (i) Goalpara (ii) Dhubri (iii) Kokrajhar (iv) Bongaigaon and (v) Chirang.


=== Bijni Kingdom ===
The Bijni Kingdom was situated between 250 53' and 260 32' N. and 900 85' and 910 85' E. The estate was in possession of the Bijni family, descended from the Koch king Nara Narayan, who reigned over Kamata kingdom from 1534 to 1584. Before his death, Nara Narayana allowed his kingdom to be divided between his son Lakshmi Narayan and his nephew Raghu Rai (son of Chilarai). Raghu Rai established his capital at Barnagar in the Barpeta (now a district in Assam) and received as his share the Koch territories lying to the east of Sankosh River.
After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghu Rai declared independence. The eastern kingdom ruled by Raghu Rai came to be called Koch Hajo and the western Koch Bihar. Soon after the declaration of independence, the two kingdoms started showing hostilities against each other. Raghu Rai was succeeded by his son Parikshit Narayan and was defeated in 1602 by the army of Nawab of Dhaka (governor for the Mughals) who was moved by Lakshmi Narayan (ruler of Koch Bihar). Parikshit was defeated at Dhubri (now a district in Assam) and sued for peace. But soon, he continued with the hostilities and in 1614 was driven up to Pandu, now in Guwahati. There, Parikshit surrendered and agreed to become a vassal of the Mughal Empire. But before he could take up this assignment he died. The Mughals then appointed Kabisekhar as the kanungo and instructed Sheikh Ibrahim Karori to set up a Mughal system of administration. Parikshit's son Bijit Narayan was confirmed by the Mughals as 'jamindar' of the area between the river Manas and the Sankosh, and from him, the Bijni family descended. The name "Bijni", now a sub-division of Chirang district of Bodoland Territorial Area in Assam, comes from the name of the king Bijit Narayan.
Under the Mughal rule, the Bijni king Bijit Narayan paid a tribute of Rs. 5,998 which was afterward commuted to an annual delivery of 68 elephants. During the last two decades of the 17th century, the Mughals lost their influence on Assam while the East India Company gradually started strengthening their foothold in different parts of India including Bengal.
The East India Company was awarded the 'diwani' or overlordship of Bengal by the empire following the Battle of Buxar in 1764 and the company came to an agreement (known as Permanent Settlement) with Bengali landlords in 1793 to fix revenues to be raised from land. With the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, the East India Company finally took control of both Eastern Assam and Western Assam. However, it was doubtful whether Goalpara was ever included in the Permanent Settlement. According to The Imperial Gazetteer of India (Volume 8), a small assessment from the Bijni kingdom was always accepted in lieu of land revenue, though it has sometimes been argued it was nothing more than a tribute. The Imperial Gazetteer of India, which was published in 1902, states that the Bijni family paid a revenue of Rs. 1,500 and cesses amounting to nearly Rs. 19,000 for an estate which covered an area of 950 square miles (2,500 km2) with an estimated rent-roll of Rs. 2 lakh.
On the conclusion of the Bhutan war (or Duar War) fought between British India and Bhutan in 1864–1865, the Bijni family put forward claims to hold a large tract of land in the Eastern Duir which they alleged that they were in possession under the Bhutan government. The claim was admitted and in 1870 a settlement was effected with the Court of Wards on behalf of the minor Bijni Raja. The present extent of the estate to which they were entitled was still a matter of uncertainty, but in 1882 it was ruled by the government of India that the Raja should receive 130,000 acres (530 km2) of land. These estates generally remained under the direct management of the government, who allowed to the Raja 7.5 percent of the collections as his share of profits.

== Industries ==


=== Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Bongaigaon ===
The Bongaigaon Refinery is the eighth largest refinery of Indian Oil. Formed upon the amalgamation of Bongaigaon Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (BRPL) with Indian Oil on 25 March. 2009, Bongaigaon refinery is situated at Dhaligaon in Chirang district of Assam, 200 km west of Guwahati.

It has two Crude Distillation Units (CDU), two Delayed Coker Units (DCU) and a Coke Calcination Unit (CCU) with a processing capacity of 2.35 million tonnes per year of crude oil. The first CDU with a capacity of 1 million tonnes per year was commissioned in 1979. The capacity was further increased to 1.35 million tonnes per year in 1986. An LPG bottling plant with a capacity of 44 million tonnes per year was also commissioned in 2003.
The refinery produces a wide range of petroleum products, namely LPG, Naphtha, MS, SKO, HSD, LDO, LSHS, LVFO, RPC, CPC, Needle coke and solvents (Petrosol and Bonmex-II) by processing Assam Crude and Ravva Crude (from the Ravva oil fields of Krishna Godavari Basin). Bongaigaon refinery has also undertaken special endeavours towards environment protection and conservation. The refinery has developed an ecological park and a pond surrounding it containing 65,000 cubic metres of water, through which the storm water drains of the plant are routed for final discharge. Another natural pond with a capacity of 30,000 cubic meters of water has developed into an environment-friendly park-cum-pond for migratory birds. In addition, a rainwater harvesting system has been installed in the Bongaigaon township complex and the installation of solar water heating systems (SWHS) and solar photovoltaic systems (streetlights) is underway.
In recognition of its green initiatives, Bongaigaon refinery has been a recipient of numerous prestigious awards, the latest being the National Award for "Prevention of Pollution" from the Ministry of Environment and Forests on 16 September 2010. The award acknowledges the Refinery's outstanding contribution in environmental conservation and creating environmental awareness in the Bodo Territorial Autonomous District region of Assam, which is predominantly a tribal dominated area. Bongaigoan Refinery is the country's first oil Refinery to have won this coveted honour. Last year the Refinery was honoured with the Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puruskar by the Ministry of Environment, as well as the 'Greentech Environment Excellence Gold Award 2008' and the 'Indira Gandhi Paryavarn Puraskar 2006' for its outstanding environmental performance.

== People ==
From the chequered historical background of this district, it can easily be surmised that the entire area was ruled by Kings/Zaminders/Feudal Lords hailing from the Koch-Rajbongshies belonging to Indo-Mongoloid ethnic group of peoples right from the 15th century to the end of princely states in AD 1956. The kings of this area had their hoary past and can be traced back to the "Kiratees" of epic age (Mahabharata fame) that is pre-vedic age. These Kiratees of impact are also mentioned in Kalika Purana and Jogingi Tantra and also in histories written both by native and foreign scholars.


== Socio-cultural spectrum ==
Apart from the prevalent common environment in the erstwhile Bijni Kingdom and undivided Goalpara district of 1822, the most striking features of Bongaigaon district are the Hilly Caves (Gumphas) and stone carvings of Jogighopa hill-rocks demonstrating the existence of Buddhist culture. The hills and the hilly rocks, the rivers, natural and man-made ponds, the deep forest, the trees, plants, and the bushes.


== Natural resource base ==
The district falls under Brahmaputra river basin. The district has a large reservoir of water resources with the river Brahmaputra and its two tributaries of Ai and Manas. The soil type is generally sandy to sandy loam with alluvial deposits. Among the 15 agro-climatic regions of the country, categorised/identified on the basis of homogeneity in agro-characteristics, Bongaigaon falls in the Lower Brahmaputra Valley zone. The agro-climatic conditions of the district are conducive to various agricultural activities. The topography of the district represents mostly plain lands except a small portion of isolated hills in Bijni sub-division, bordering Bhutan. The district is drained by the Brahmaputra on the south and two of its major tributaries viz. Ai & Manas flowing from north to south. About 72 percent of normal rainfall is received from May to August. Agriculture in the district is characterised by over-dependence on rainfall, the predominance of seasonal crops and traditional methods of cultivation. The forest cover in the district is estimated to be 56598 hectares i.e. 22.6 percent of its total geographical area as per the estimates of Forest Statistics of Assam 2005. The Manas National Park is a wildlife forest reserve which lies in the northern part of the district.


== Climate ==
Bongaigaon has a borderline monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) marginally too cool to be a tropical savanna climate (Aw). During the "cool" season from November to February, afternoons are warm to very warm and mornings pleasantly cool. In the "hot" season of March and April, the weather becomes hot and thunderstorm rainfalls increase in frequency to prelude the oppressive monsoon season from June to September where heavy rainfall occurs every afternoon.

The Manas River (Pron: ˈmʌnəs) is a transboundary river in the Himalayan foothills between southern Bhutan and India.
It is named after Manasa, the serpent god in Hindu mythology. It is the largest river system of Bhutan, among its four major river systems; the other three are Amo Chu or Torsa, Wong Chu or Raidak, and Mo Chu or Sankosh. It is met by three other major streams before it again debouches into India in western Assam. The total length of the river is 376 kilometres (234 mi):  it flows through Bhutan for 272 kilometres (169 mi) and then through Assam for 104 kilometres (65 mi) before it joins the mighty Brahmaputra River at Jogighopa. Another major tributary of the Manas, the Aie river joins it in Assam at Bangpari.The river valley has two major reserve forest areas, namely the Royal Manas National Park (43,854 hectares (108,370 acres), established in 1966) in Bhutan and the contiguous Manas Wildlife Sanctuary (391,000 hectares (970,000 acres) in 1955 increased to 95,000 hectares (230,000 acres) in December 1985) encompassing Project Tiger Reserve, an Elephant Reserve and a Biosphere Reserve, which constitutes a UNESCO World Heritage Site declared in December 1985.


=== Sri Surjya Pahar ===
Sri Surya Pahar (Assamese: শ্ৰী সূৰ্য পাহাৰ) is a significant but relatively unknown archaeological site in Assam, India. The site is a hilly terrain where several rock-cut Shivalingas, votive stupas and the deities of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain pantheon are scattered in an area of about one km. The site is centred on the hills (Pahar) of Sri Surya which is profusely filled up with Shiva Lingas (Lingam). The popular belief is that 99999 Shiva Lingas were engraved here by Vyasa in order to build up a second Kashi (where there were 1,00000 Shiva Lingas) and once it was one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the region. There is no historical evidence exactly how many Lingams once dotted these hills, but still, there are hundreds of them, from tiny to large in size, scattered everywhere at the foot of the hill and covering the extensive area after centuries of neglect and pilferage. The exact figure of the Lingas (and also other deities and relics) in the hill is yet to be counted scientifically.


=== Manas National Park ===
Bongaigaon city is the entry point for the Manas National Park. Manas National Park or Manas Wildlife Sanctuary is a national park, UNESCO Natural World Heritage site, a Project Tiger reserve, an elephant reserve and a biosphere reserve in Assam, India. Located in the Himalayan foothills, it is contiguous with the Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan. The park is known for its rare and endangered endemic wildlife such as the Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, golden langur and pygmy hog. Manas is famous for its population of the wild water buffalo.


=== Lalmati-Duramari Ganesh Temple ===
The Lalmati-Duramari Ganesh Temple near Abhayapuri town under North Salmara Sub-Division is one of the oldest temples of the state.
The historicity of the images are yet to be ascertained. But after a study of the stone carving and modes related to the carved idols, archeologists opine that the temple and images belong to the 8th to 10th centuries AD
There are three views advanced as the reason for the destruction of the temple. The first view has it that earthquakes during the 8th and 10th centuries destroyed the temple and its images, while according to the second view, Kalapahar who revolted against worshippers and priests, destroyed the temple along with other temples and images in the North-East. The third view has it that Burmese (Maan) invaders who camped at Malegarh (Manegarh) hills destroyed the temple along with the idols. But it seems that earthquake has been the prime cause of the destruction of the temple.


=== Rock Cut Caves ===
The best specimens of the architecture of the Salasthambha period are the remains of the five rock-cut caves at Jogighopa on the bank of the Brahmaputra in the district of Bongaigaon. These are the unique examples of rock-cut architecture in Assam. Though these rock-cut caves are not of such architectural interest as those in Western India, these remains at Jogighopa are the clear evidence of the fact that Assam was not outside the movement of this particular type of art developed in India as it will be seen from the description of the best-preserved cave noticed at Jogighopa. 
The cave measures 2.60 m breadth, 1.8 metre in depth and 1.90 meters in height and also has a roughly rounded ceiling and in front a verandah 75 cm long by 35 cm broad. A platform of brick and mud masonry is found inside which is obviously a later addition. A chase running across the entire breath of the cave on the top serves to drain away rainwater from the facade. Flights of steps have been cut into the rock on either side and ledge on the top diverts the rainwater from the facade. The cave bears no sculptural designs. The other caves at the site have no flights and verandah and are smaller in size than the best preserved one.
This architectural site has been taken up by the Archaeological Survey of India for preservation.
