Barañain (in Basque and officially; Spanish Barañáin) is a town and municipality located in the province and autonomous community of Navarre, northern Spain.

== Geography ==
Barañáin is located on a plateau surrounded by the rivers Arga and Elorz, whose erosive action has created ravines whose slopes are progressively softened towards the west, where both currents have their confluence. To the east, this plateau communicates with that of Pamplona, of which it can be considered the western end. The Arga defines most of the northern boundary of the municipality, while the river Elorz, which flows to the south, serves as a boundary in the last five hundred metres before its mouth.


== Administration ==
Until 1987, Barañáin was part of the Cendea de Cizur. That year it was constituted as its own local entity. Historically, Barañáin has been a predominantly socialist town, since from 1979 to 1995 it has been governed by the PSN-PSOE without interruption and with the same candidate.
In the General Elections, the PSOE is always the most voted list with a great distance between the other parties.
