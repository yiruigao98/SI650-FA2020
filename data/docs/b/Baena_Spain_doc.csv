== Controversy ==
Carlos Alberto Baena, promoter of the Law 1482 of 2011 by which punitive measures are set against racism and discrimination appeared on a video in which Maria Luisa Piraquive, cofounder of the Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International, was seen stating that people with physical disabilities cannot preach from the pulpit of the church because of "what the people may say" and "aesthetic reasons", reasons that, according to her, may cause a negative impact on the faith of newcomers to the church. However, it was found that the controversial video was the pivotal point of a powerful smear campaign, in which there was participation of other political parties and, directly or indirectly, participation of the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia. Such smear campaign directly impacted the MIRA party, and it became apparent that the objective was Baena´s party, since the video was filmed more than 8 years before it was released by media during the 2014 incidents, precisely two months prior the 2014 Colombian parliamentary election. In addition, in the complete video Maria Luisa states that anyone can preach in the church if God tells them to do so.
As a result of this media attack to Baena´s party, it became publicly known that Dora Landázuri, one of the MIRA party´s candidates to the 2014 Colombian parliamentary elections, is a physically disabled African-Colombian woman, which left no ground for accusations against Baena or his party on the basis of discrimination towards physically disabled people.
