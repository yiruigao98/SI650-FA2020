Bagha Purana was a small village till the early 70s primarily consisting of three pattis namely Bagha Patti, Purana Patti and Mughlu Patti. This small village located on the intersection of Moga-Kotkapura road and Mudki-Nihal Singh Wala road got prominence after a Government Polytechnic was established, a few kilometers away. Thereafter it became a trade center of the villages around it and developed into a small town. The village got a status of town when a Nagar Panchayat (smallest form of urban local self-government unit) was formed in 1974 which was upgraded to a Municipal Council, a few years ago. In 2000, it got the status of a sub-division headquarters which facilitated the establishment of all tehsil-level offices of the Government.
Earlier, the majority of the population thrived on agriculture, as such most of the other economic activity is driven by agriculture like agro based industry (rice-mills, cold stores etc.), commission agents etc. The tertiary activities include the transport and related businesses like finance etc. Many banks have opened their branches due to enhanced economic activity over the years, as well as the needs of the non-resident Indian community from this region, especially in Canada & Australia.
The town also boasts of being the home-town of some of the great personalities. To name a few, Major Malkit SIngh Brar, who was awarded the Mahavir Chakra (posthumously) in 1948 was born in Alam Wala (a small and first village near Bagha Purana) and He got educated here.
