== History ==


=== World War I ===
During World War I, a skirmish took place in Bafilo between French and German troops in on 13 August 1914. French forces first crossed the border between French Dahomey and German Togoland on 8 or 9 of August 1914. French units in north-eastern Togoland came into contact with German ones on 13 August in the districts of Sansane-Mangu and Sokode-Balfilo. After some light fighting, the French company retreated after facing resistance stronger than they had expected.Although this was  technically a victory for German forces, it did little to stall the Allied advance and by the end of August the colony was surrendered to the Allies.
