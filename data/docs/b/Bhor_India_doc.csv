Igor (Russian: Игорь, romanized: Igor' [ˈiɡərʲ]; Ukrainian: Ігор, romanized: Ihor [ˈiɦor]; Belarusian: Ігар, romanized: Ihar [ˈiɣar]; Serbian Cyrillic: Игор, pronounced [îɡor]) is a common given Slavic name derived from the Norse name Ingvar, that was brought to ancient Rus' by the Norse Varangians, in the form Ingvar or Yngvar.  Igor (son of the Varangian chief Rurik) was left as a child with Rurik's distant relative (supposedly) first Grand Prince of Kiev - Oleg and later, after the death of Oleg replaced him on Kiev's throne. Outside of the Slavic language sphere, the name has also become common in Brazil and Portugal, and in the Basque-speaking part of Spain.
