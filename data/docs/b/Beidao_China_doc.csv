This list of Chinese monarchs includes rulers of China with various titles prior to the establishment of the Republic in 1912. From the Zhou dynasty until the Qin dynasty, rulers usually held the title "king" (Chinese: 王; pinyin: wáng). With the separation of China into different Warring States, this title had become so common that the unifier of China, the first Qin Emperor Qin Shihuang created a new title for himself, that of "emperor" (pinyin: huángdì). The title of Emperor of China continued to be used for the remainder of China's imperial history, right down to the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.
While many other monarchs existed in and around China throughout its history, this list covers only those with a quasi-legitimate claim to the majority of China, or those who have traditionally been named in king-lists. The following list of Chinese monarchs is in no way comprehensive.
Chinese sovereigns were known by many different names, and how they should be identified is often confusing. Sometimes the same emperor is commonly known by two or three separate names, or the same name is used by emperors of different dynasties. The tables below do not necessarily include all of an emperor's names – for example, posthumous names could run to more than twenty characters and were rarely used in historical writing – but, where possible, the most commonly used name or naming convention has been indicated. Scholars also often use common terms to refer to some monarchs with special circumstances — "Modi" (末帝; "last emperor"), "Mozhu" (末主; "last lord"), "Houzhu" (後主; "last lord"), "Shaodi" (少帝; "young emperor"), "Shaozhu" (少主; "young lord"), "Feidi" (廢帝; "deposed emperor"), etc.; these terms are not temple names, posthumous names or regnal names.
In some cases, the regnal or era name is changed in the same year as the death of the previous sovereign; in other cases, the name change occurs in the subsequent year. Thus, the date given for the beginning of a reign may actually refer to the first full year of the sovereign's reign.
These tables may not necessarily represent the most recently updated information on Chinese monarchs; please check the page for the relevant dynasty for possible additional information.

== Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors (三皇五帝) (2852–2070 BCE) ==

Although it is ingrained in Chinese mythology that the earliest mythological rulers of China included three huáng (皇, generally translated "sovereign" or "august one") and five dì (帝, generally translated "emperor"), both terms denoting demigod status, their identities have differed between different sources, with some individuals, such as the Yellow Emperor, being regarded as either sovereign or emperor, depending on the source. The two characters would later be taken together by Qin Shi Huang to form the new title huángdì (皇帝, emperor), thus claiming legendary status for himself.
Note: These figures are considered to be legendary.


== Xia dynasty (夏朝) (2070–1600 BCE) ==
Chinese convention: use "Xia" + regnal name


== Shang dynasty (商朝) (1600–1046 BCE) ==
Chinese convention: use "Shang" + posthumous name


== Zhou dynasty (周朝) (1046–256 BCE) ==
Chinese convention: use "Zhou" + posthumous name ("Wang" is the chinese term for "King")
Note: The first generally accepted date in Chinese history is 841 BC, the beginning of the Gonghe regency. All dates prior to this are the subject of often vigorous dispute.

After King Nan was deposed by Qin, Ji Jie (姬杰), Duke Wen of the vassal duchy of Eastern Zhou was proclaimed the new king of Zhou and claimed the title until his death in 249 BCE. However, the King of Qin had taken possession of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons (九鼎), and Ji Jie's reign was not widely recognized.  Historians generally considered the title of Son of Heaven to be vacant from 256 to 221 BCE.


== Qin dynasty (秦朝) (221–207 BCE) ==

Chinese convention: use regnal name
Note: The State of Qin was founded in the 9th century BCE as a vassal of the Zhou dynasty.  In 325 BCE, the Duke of Qing, Ying Si (嬴駟), declared himself king and was given the regnal name King Huiwen of Qin (秦惠文王).  In 256 BCE, King Zhaoxiang of Qin ended the Zhou dynasty, and in 221 BCE, Ying Zheng completed the conquest of the other states (kingdoms) and declared himself Qin Shi Huang, or "First Emperor of Qin."  The unification of China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE is usually considered to be the beginning of Imperial China.
