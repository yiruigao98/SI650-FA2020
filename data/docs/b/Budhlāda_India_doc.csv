== History ==
The village is said to have been named after two brothers, Budha and Lada, who were khatri by caste. Once a part of the state of Kaithal, it was punitively annexed along with the rest of that territory after not helping the British during the insurgency of 1857. The village later merged with Karnal District, one of the largest markets in East Punjab. The area was said to be a good area for the recruitment of military personnel, second only to Rohtak. Hawaldar Joginder Singh Datewas, a soldier recruited from Budhlada, was notably awarded the Ashoka Chakra.
In the 1930s and 1940s, Budhlada was popular for its boora khand (superfine sugar). A large factory was located near the railway station, with consignments sent to Lahore and Karachi. This period of relative prosperity ended when it was cut off from those markets by the Partition of India in 1947.As of the 1991 census, the total population of the city was 18,123.
Under the British Raj, Budhlada was a "riyasat" (princely state), home to a police station prior to independence. Lok Nike (Hero of People) Jiauna Maur's brother Kishna Maur was arrested by Budhlada police station. Both brothers were well-known for helping poor people. Sucha Singh Soorma's village Samauo is almost 18 km (11 mi) from Budhlada but it remained neglected after India gained independence. The martyr Capt. K. K. Gaur, social reformer Babu Hitabhilashi, and scientist Dr. M. L. Singla, who headed the Chandrayaan programme, are also from Budhlada.
Budhlada is also an important centre of the Praja movement. Freedom fighters used Budhlada for many Praja movements in the present Bathinda district. The local people started participating in the Praja Movement after the death of Sewa Singh Thikriwala (president of Riyasat Praja Mandal party).
