Babina is a cantonment town in Jhansi district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Rajeev Singh Parichha is MLA of Babina constituency.


== Etymology ==
It is said that Babina is an anacronym for British Army Base in North Asia. While this has been endorsed by the Cantonment Board of Babina, it appears to be a backronym that has been endorsed without due verification.
Contrary to what the alleged anacronym suggests, the cantonment at Babina had no association with the British Raj, and was opened in 1959, 12 years after the British left India. Furthermore, India is considered to be a part of South Asia, and not North Asia as the anacronym suggests. This suggests that the popular anacronym is very likely a modern invention and is not based on factual evidence.
