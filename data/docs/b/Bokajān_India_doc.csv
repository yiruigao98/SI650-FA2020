Cement Corporation of India Limited (CCI) is a public-sector undertaking of the government of India. The company was incorporated as a wholly government-owned corporation on 18 January 1965, with the objective of setting up cement units in public sector to help achieve self-sufficiency in cement production in the country.
CCI is based in New Delhi. The corporation manufactures various types of cements, such as Portland pozzolana cement (PPC), Portland slag cement (PSC), and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) of varying grades - 33, 43,53 and 53S (special grade cement for manufacture of sleepers for Indian Railways).
CCI currently has three profit making operating units and various regional centers spread over different Indian states and union territories, with a total annual installed capacity of 38.48 lakh tonne.

The units are spread throughout the country from East (Bokajan in Assam) to West (Akaltara, Mandhar in Chhattisgarh and Nayagaon in Madhya Pradesh) and from North (Rajban in Himachal Pradesh and Charkhi Dadri in Haryana) to South (Kurkunta in Karnataka and Adilabad, Tandur in Telangana), with one cement grinding unit in Delhi.
The performance of CCI was adversely affected due to severe liquidity crunch and infrastructural constraints particularly related to power shortage. 7 units out of 10 are non-operational due to various reasons, especially after  Mrs Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister was no more. The company became sick and was referred to BIFR. BIFR had directed the OA to appoint a merchant banker to explore the sale of CCI as a whole as a going concern basis or its units individually or collectively.
