== Mining ==
Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered in the vicinity of Bambari, though the considerable distance to the sea—1500 km—probably makes exploitatation of these reserves doubtful in the near future.   A heavy duty railway and a deepwater port in a neighbouring country would be required.
The mining resource also includes iron deposits at Bakala.
