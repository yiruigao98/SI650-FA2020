== History ==


=== 19th century ===
Bradenton was established in 1842. The town was originally spelled "Braidentown," as a spelling error was made when it applied for a post office on May 9, 1878. The first bridge across Wares Creek would be built in 1886. The following year, Bradenton was designated the county seat after Pine Level, which was now in DeSoto County was formed from eastern Manatee County. A county courthouse would be built in 1890 at Courthouse Square.


=== 20th century ===

Railroad service would be extended from Palmetto across the Manatee River to Bradenton in 1902. Bradenton would be incorporated on May 19, 1903. One of the earliest moves made by the municipal government was amending the name to "Bradentown". The city took the name of Dr. Joseph Braden of Virginia, whose nearby fort-like house was a refuge for early settlers during the Seminole Wars. On December 29, a streetcar line would begin operation going from Bradenton to the neighboring city of Manatee and would go west crossing Wares Creek to the nearby community of Fogartyville. The company operating the line would have financial difficulties likely due to a lack of ridership and would cancel the line in 1906.In 1912, the first road, Range Road leading from present day Bradenton (then, Manatee) to Sarasota was built. The original county courthouse was bought and moved to a new location becoming a grade school for black students in the area, Lincoln Academy Grammar School that same year. A new courthouse would be built on the site of the old one which still stands today in the following year, 1913.The current city of Bradenton was formed in 1943, when the Florida legislature merged the cities of Manatee (incorporated in 1888) and Bradentown.
