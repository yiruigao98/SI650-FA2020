Bârlad (Romanian pronunciation: [bɨrˈlad] (listen)) is a city in Vaslui County, Romania. It lies on the banks of the Bârlad River, which waters the high plains of Western Moldavia.
At Bârlad the railway from Iași diverges, one branch skirting the Siret River, the other skirting the Prut River; both reunite at Galați. Along with a maze of narrow and winding streets, Bârlad features several notable modern buildings, including the hospital administered by the Saint Spiridion Foundation of Iași. In the vicinity of the city are the ruins of a Roman camp.
The city is the birthplace of Romanian Domnitor (Ruler) and diplomat Alexandru Ioan Cuza.


== Etymology ==
Scholars continue to debate the origin of the city's name. The Hypatian Codex mentions a market town called Berlad, and some historians, influenced by a document Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu published in the 19th century, have tried to link this town and its inhabitants (variously considered Romanians, East Slavs or an amalgam) with the Moldavian Bârlad. Ioan Bogdan demonstrated that the Hasdeu document was false, thus invalidating the hypothesis. Like Siret and Suceava, the medieval town took its name from the adjacent river, but nothing more can be said for certain. Constantin Cihodaru linked the name, of possible Hungarian origin, to a Slavic word (berlo — "rod", "cottage" or birlo — "swamp"), to which was added the Hungarian suffix -d, also found, for example, in the names Cenad, Arad, Tușnad, and Tășnad. Supporting this notion is the historic presence of a significant Hungarian community, with traditions recalling the fight against the Tatars in the mid-14th century.


== History ==
During World War II, Bârlad was captured on 24 August 1944 by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front during the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive.
