Butel is located along the north-central and north-eastern areas of Skopje not far the modern city center and most of the municipality extends eastward in a panhandle shape toward the Skopska Crna Gora mountain range. It borders Gazi Baba Municipality to the southeast, Čair Municipality to the south, Karpoš Municipality to the southwest, Šuto Orizari Municipality and Čučer-Sandevo Municipality to the northwest, and Lipkovo Municipality to the northeast.


== History ==
Prior to 2004 Butel municipality was within the boundaries of a larger Čair municipality that had a majority Macedonian population (48.60%), followed by Albanians (38.89%), Turks (4.12%), Bosniaks (3.40%), Romani (1.46%) and Serbs (2.11%). The new territorial-administrative reform of 2004 divided the municipal unit into a smaller Čair municipality with an Albanian majority and a separate Butel municipality with a Macedonian majority. The new boundaries of Čair municipality resulted in the loss of its industrial zone to Butel municipality which previously provided most of the revenue for the Čair municipal budget.
