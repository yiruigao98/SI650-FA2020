A Peruvian postal code is a five-digit string that comprises part of a postal address in Peru. Prior to 2011, only the major cities of Lima and Callao used postal codes. However, in February 2011 a nationwide system was implemented which employs a five-digit numeric format. Similar to the postal codes of Mexico, Brazil, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere, postal codes in Peru are strictly numerical, using only numbers.    
The first two digits of the postal code identify the administrative region or department, whereas the final two digits represents a specific district or location within a district. The middle  digit does not strictly relate to specific provinces, therefore it is possible and indeed common for one province to be split amongst multiple postal zones. 
For example, the province of Chachapoyas contains portions of postal zones 010, 012, 013 and 014 whereas postal zone 011 is entirely within Bongará Province. Regardless, it can be understood that all five postal zones are within the Department of Amazonas, since they all begin with the digits 01.

== Postal codes ==
The following chart lists the various postal codes in use throughout Peru. Each department or region is assigned a two-digit regional code. This makes up the beginning of the postal code. The final two digits comprise a geographic code which denotes a specific district or area within a district. The middle digit is not tied to administrative boundaries. Final digits other than "0" or "5" tend to denote urban or built-up areas, though this is not always the case.  
Therefore, the postal code for the district of Jazan, in the Amazones Region, is 01130, whereas the postal code for the city of Pedro Ruiz Gallo within Jazan district, is 01131. 
Similarly, while the district of Conchuccos has the postal code 02875, the urban city of the same name uses the postal code 02876.
