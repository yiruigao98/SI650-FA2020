Bétera (Valencian pronunciation: [ˈbeteɾa]) is a municipality in the comarca of Camp de Túria in the Valencian Community, Spain. With 23.647 inhabitants, it is the second most populous town in the Camp de Túria shire (INE 2018), in the second zone of the Valencia metropolitan area.


== Geography ==

Bétera is situated on the southern slopes of the Serra Calderona, 15 km from Valencia and 23 km from the Mediterranean Sea on the border with the Valencian "market garden", L'Horta. It has a slightly undulating surface, reaching 156 meters at its highest point.
Its geographical location between the sea and mountains provides a microclimate, which is the mildest of the region, where the prevailing winds are Levant and Ponente. The rains occur mainly in autumn and spring.
As it is in the metropolitan area of Valencia, there are several road links, such as the Burjassot-Torres Torres road, the Bétera-Olocau road, the San Antonio de Benagéber road which links to the motorway Valencia Turia-Ademuz (CV-35) and the Mediterranean motorway (A-7), as well as others leading to the parishes and neighbourhoods of the city and surrounding towns.
Public transport is accessible via one of the northern terminal stations of Metro Line 1 of Valencia. This railway line (which, though given the title "Metro", is more a commuter rail) is heir to the former Valencia Trenet, ranging from Bétera to the Pont de Fusta station in Valencia. The Sanatori Psiquiàtric stop also serves the town.
