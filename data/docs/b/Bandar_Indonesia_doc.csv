Bandar Lampung (Lampungese: ) is the capital and largest city of the Indonesian province of Lampung. Located on the southern tip of Sumatra, Bandar Lampung was originally called Tanjungkarang–Telukbetung, since it was a unification of two major settlements in Lampung, before being renamed in 1983.The city proper and South Lampung Regency (which borders the city on its northern and eastern sides) are major transmigrasi recipients; in testimony thereof, it has become the third-densest city in Sumatra, after Medan and Palembang. The city's area is about 169.21 km², with an estimated population of 1,015,910 as of 2017.


== History ==


=== Early history ===
A report by the Banten regent William Craft to Governor-General Cornelis Speelman states that, on the basis of a description provided by Pangeran Aria Dipati Ningrat on the 17th June 1682, "Lampung-Telokbetong at the edge of the sea is the seat of power of a Dipati Temenggung Nata Negara, with power over three thousand people". This date would later be adopted by the city administration as its official founding date.


=== Dutch East Indies ===
Under the Dutch colonial administration, 1912 Staatsblad 462 codified the city as being part and parcel of the Onderafdeling Telokbetong, composed of present-day Teluk Betung and its environs. The Onderafdeling's capital was Tanjung Karang, whilst Teluk Betung itself served as the seat of government for the Karesidenan Lampung.


=== Under Japanese occupation ===
During the Japanese colonial era, present-day Bandar Lampung was administered as a city (市, shi), led by a Japanese mayor (市長, shicho) who was assisted by an Indonesian deputy mayor (副市長, fuku-shicho).


=== Post-Independence ===
Tanjung Karang and Teluk Betung initially fell under the jurisdiction of South Lampung Regency, until a 1948 law consolidated the two and elevated them to independent city status.


== Administrative divisions ==
In 2010, the city consisted of thirteen districts (kecamatan), tabulated below with their populations at the 2010 Census:

Since 2010, seven additional districts have been created by the splitting of existing districts, bringing the total to twenty districts. The new districts are Bumi Waras, Enggal, Kedamaian, Labuhan Ratu, Langkapura, Telukbetung Timur (East Telukbetung) and Way Halim.


== Climate ==
Bandar Lampung has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round. Rain gets noticeably heavier from November to April.

Bandar Lampung is served by Radin Inten II Airport (TKG), in the neighbouring county of South Lampung. The airport can be accessed by public transportation, such as bus and mini bus.


=== Road transport ===

Bandar Lampung has several road transportation alternatives. The most popular is a minibus called angkot, an abbreviation from Angkutan Kota (literally translated as City Transportation). They serve routes throughout the city, operated privately and cheaply. Usually, an angkot covers some area between Tanjung Karang (heart of Bandar Lampung) and an urban area. Currently, routes covered are Tanjung Karang - Garuntang, Tanjung Karang - Teluk Betung, Tanjung Karang - Rajabasa, Tanjung Karang - Sukarame, Tanjung Karang - Langkapura and many more.
Bandarlampung Transportation Office has announced that in October 2011 will serve two of seven routes planned by bus rapid transit — the Rajabasa-Sukaraja and Sukaraja-Korpri housing complex in Sukarame.
