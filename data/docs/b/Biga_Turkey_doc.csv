== History ==
Within the area of Biga (at Karabiga) is the site of the ancient city of Pegaea (Greek: Πηγαία), also known as Pegae or Pegai (Πηγαί, "the Springs") until late Byzantine times (in Crusader sources it is also known as Spiga). Archaeologists have not yet established how far back the site has been occupied. In ancient times, Pegaea, located on the plain of Adrastea on the border between the Troad and Mysia, was sometimes included as part of one and sometimes the other. Since coming under Ottoman rule in 1364 it has been known as Biga. Under the Ottomans, it was the seat of a sanjak.
