Broad Ripple Village is one of seven areas designated as cultural districts in Indianapolis, Indiana. Located about six miles (9.7 km) north of downtown Indianapolis, Broad Ripple was established in 1837 as an independent municipality and annexed by the city of Indianapolis in 1922. Its name originated with the title of a poem titled "Broad Ripple" by Hoosier Poet James Whitcomb Riley. The neighborhood has a reputation for being socially, economically, and ethnically diverse.Broad Ripple's position as a cornerstone of Indianapolis's youth culture and nightlife is a result of its thriving bar scene and the nearby presence of Butler University. Staying true to the neighborhood motto "we're open if you are," numerous Broad Ripple bars and restaurants remain open as late as 3 A.M. – often on weekdays as well as weekends. The neighborhood is home to many of Indianapolis's locally owned restaurants, independent art galleries, private boutiques and specialty shops, and the popular Monon Trail. Within a few city blocks, one can find a wide variety of food, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Cajun, Middle Eastern, French, English, and Japanese as well as traditional American fare and four independent microbreweries. Entertainment offerings include multiple venues for live music, showcasing both local artists and nationally touring acts in genres such as rock, hip hop, country, and jazz.
In 1987, Lillian R. Barcio founded and served as the editor in chief of Broad Ripple's first dedicated monthly newspaper, The Village Sampler. The first issue was published in June 1987. The paper ceased publication in December 1998. In 2004 a free biweekly newspaper, The Broad Ripple Gazette, was created by Broad Ripple native Alan Hague.Broad Ripple High School, which closed at the end of the 2017–2018 school year, was one of the earliest Indianapolis Public Schools. Some notable Hoosiers raised in or near the Broad Ripple neighborhood include late night talk show host David Letterman, professional football player Rosevelt Colvin, former IUPUI and Pacer and current Cleveland Cavaliers guard George Hill, Los Angeles Clippers assistant coach Mike Woodson, astronaut David Wolf, actor Abraham Benrubi, Second Lady of the United States Karen Pence, author Dan Wakefield, and architect Michael Graves.
Broad Ripple Park is a 62-acre (25 ha) park bordering the White River and located just to the northeast of the village. It features an outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, baseball diamond, athletic fields, playground, picnic shelters, dog park, wooded preserve, fitness path, and a boat ramp. Broad Ripple is connected to downtown Indianapolis on public bus rapid transit via IndyGo's Red Line (Route 90). The Red Line's Broad Ripple Station is located in the median of College Avenue and is accessed from College's intersection with Broad Ripple Avenue and Westfield Boulevard. Other IndyGo traditional bus routes also run through the village, connecting it to additional neighborhoods in Indianapolis.
