Banqiao District (Chinese: 板橋區; pinyin: Bǎnqiáo Qū) is a district and the seat of New Taipei City, Taiwan. It has the third-highest population density in Taiwan, with over 24,000 people per km2. Until the creation of New Taipei City, Banqiao (then transliterated as Banciao or Pan-ch'iao) was an incorporated county-controlled city and the former seat of Taipei County.


== Name origin ==
The district's old name was Pang-kio (Chinese: 枋橋; pinyin: Fāngqiáo; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pang-kiô; lit.: 'timbered bridge'), which dates back to the Qing Dynasty during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1735 - 1796 AD). A wooden bridge, locally called Pang-kio-thau (枋橋頭), was built for pedestrians to cross a brook located in the west of today's Banqiao, the modern day Nanzigou (湳仔溝, literally "Nanzi Creek"). The spellings Pankyu, Pankio, and Pankyo can be found in English-language works of the early 20th century.In 1920, the Japanese government modified the name to Itabashi (板橋, "planked bridge"). The same characters are still used today, but are read Bǎnqiáo in Mandarin. However, in Taiwanese Hokkien, the old name Pang-kiô is still the norm.


== History ==
In the early 20th century, Pankyo (Pankyu) was a walled city and said to be owned by a landlord who had lived there "in feudal style", surrounded by armed retainers.From 1920 to 1945, during Japanese rule, the area was administrated as Itahashi Town (板橋街), Kaizan District, Taihoku Prefecture.
