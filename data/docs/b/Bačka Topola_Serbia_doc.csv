Bačka Topola (Serbian Cyrillic: Бачка Топола, pronounced [bâːtʃkaː topǒla]; Hungarian: Topolya, pronounced [ˈtopojɒ]) is a town and municipality located in the North Bačka District of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. The municipality is composed of 23 local communities and has a population of 33,321, while the town itself has 14,573 inhabitants.


== Name ==
The name of the town is derived from the Serbian word topola (топола) ("poplar" in English). The first part of the name of the town was given to designate its location in the region of Bačka in contrast to places with similar names, like Topola in Šumadija or Banatska Topola in Banat.


== History ==
The town was mentioned first in 1462 under name Fibaych. This settlement was destroyed in the 16th century and new smaller settlement was later built at its location. Name Topola was first recorded in 1543, while according to the Ottoman defters from 1580, 1582, and 1590, it was mentioned as a village, whose population numbered between 21 and 23 houses. In this time, the inhabitants of the settlement were Serbs. In 1704, Topola was destroyed by kuruc rebels.
In 1731, Topola was mentioned as an uninhabited heath. In 1750, the new settlement was founded at this location and 200 Hungarian and Slovak families arrived here from Upper Hungary. It was a district center in Bács-Bodrog County as "Topolya" until 1918, when it became part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929). It was part of Yugoslavia until 1991, with the exception of Hungarian occupation between 1941 and 1944 during World War II.
