In 1914, outer areas of Incheon City (including former city centre of Gwangyo-dong of old Incheon) and Bupyeong County were joined together under the name Bucheon. In 1931, Gyenam township (myeon, 계남면) was renamed Sosa township (myeon, 소사면). In 1936,  the westernmost part of Bucheon which were part of old Incheon (including the former Incheon city centre of Gwangyo-dong) was incorporated in Incheon City and in 1940 some other part of old Incheon belonging to Bucheon Country was incorporated in Incheon again while part of old Bupyeong was annexed to Incheon at the same time. In 1941, Sosa township promoted to eup (town) status.January 1, 1963, when the great expansion of Seoul was implemented, several districts were combined to Yeongdeungpo-gu (영등포구) of Seoul Metropolitan City as below.
In 1988, two districts were established. Bucheon was divided into Nam-gu ("south", 남구) and Jung-gu ("central", 중구) along the Seoul-Incheon trainline. Present day Sosa-gu was formerly called Nam-gu.
In 1993, Bucheon's Jung-gu was separated into two further districts, forming Wonmi (원미구) and Ojeong (오정구) Districts.
The three districts were abolished in July 2016 as Bucheon decided to become a unified city without any administrative districts.
