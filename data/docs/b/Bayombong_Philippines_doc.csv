== History ==

It was in 1739 when Spanish Augustinian Friars named the place "Bayumbung", which was later changed into Bayombong. Bayombong was formally founded on June 12, 1739 during the first Mass celebrated in the region, officiated by Father Pedro Freire in a makeshift chapel at the foot of the Bangan Hill.
Bayombong came under the administration of Dominican friars as a part of the Paniqui mission pueblo a few months after its founding. The pueblo census of 1747 records 470 residents of Bayombong. The names of those considered to be founding fathers of Bayombong were Ramon Cabauatan, Jacinto Gadingan, Vicente Saquing, Ignacio Abuag, Mariano Danao, Domingo Bayaua, a certain Bincatan and a certain Mamuric. All of them were Gaddangs. Their names are remembered today in major streets of the town.
In 1754, the local government was formally organized. A Capitan del Pueblo was appointed as the chief executive. In 1982, the town became the seat of the new Diocese of Bayombong.
From 1773–1792, Fray Juan Crespo constructed the brick St. Dominic's church, the convent and the cemetery next to the church, and started the octagonal tower. By 1829, Fray Juan Molano finished the tower. In 1880 the church building was damaged in an earthquake, while more than a century later, in 1987, a fire destroyed the church and convent. In 1989, the 250th anniversary of the first Mass in Bayombong, the rebuilt cathedral was dedicated.
On 28 Nov. 1899 during the Philippine–American War, General Fernando Canon surrendered his 300-man battalion, plus 139 Spanish and 14 American prisoners, to 2nd Lt. James N. Munro's 53 men of the 4th Cavalry. Included in the release were William Rynders and Orrison Woodbury, captured with the rest of Lt. Gillmore's men during the Siege of Baler.In 1916, the American administration started a farm settlement school in Bayombong. In 1918, a high-school curriculum was added, and the school was named Bayombong Rural School. In 1928, Father de Gryse started St. Mary's, a Catholic elementary school. In 1930, Bayombong Rural School was re-purposed as Nueva Vizcaya Rural High School (NVRHS), and in 1934 St. Mary's added a high-school department. During the Japanese occupation, high school operations were suspended; they resumed in 1945. In 1947, the St. Mary's College (now St. Mary's University) was established by the CICM near the elementary and high-schools of the same name. In 1956, NVRHS was converted into two programs: Nueva Vizcaya General Comprehensive High School and Nueva Vizcaya National Agricultural School. In 1964 the agricultural school became Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural College, then in 1973 Nueva Vizcaya State Institute of Technology. Presently, the school is Nueva Vizcaya State University.
Bayombong is the 1913 birthplace of Roy Anthony Cutaran Bennett (1913–1990), editor of the Manila Bulletin who was tortured for his outspoken opposition to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. Edith Lopez Tiempo, another Bayombong native, was celebrated as a National Artist of the Philippines in 1999.
