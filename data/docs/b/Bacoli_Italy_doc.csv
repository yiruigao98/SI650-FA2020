Bacoli (Italian pronunciation: [ˈbaːkoli]; Latin: Bauli) is a comune (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Naples in the Italian region Campania, located about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) west of Naples.


== Geography ==
Bacoli borders the municipalities of Monte di Procida and Pozzuoli.
Its territory, of volcanic origin, is part of the Phlegraean Fields. The volcano of Cape Miseno and the Miseno port date from c. 35,000-10,500 years ago.


== History ==
Bacoli was founded by the ancient Romans in the 2nd or 1st c. BC, who called it Bauli. In Roman times it was a popular resort almost as famous as the nearby Baiae. Many luxurious villas were built on the coast there and on the headland. Symmachus said of Bauli in the late 4th c. AD:

"I left that place because there was a danger that if I became too fond of Bauli, all the other places I have left to see would not have pleased me".

Several major ancient Roman structures can be seen in Bacoli, including the Piscina Mirabilis, the Cento Camerelle, and the so-called Tomba Agrippina, a theatre belonging to an ancient villa.
