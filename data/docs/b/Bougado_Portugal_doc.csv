Trofa has had an important role due to its geographic location between Porto and Braga/Guimarães, being located in the border of Douro and Minho, but still inside of the district of Porto, which led to Trofa being mentioned in the time of the Roman Empire ("trofa" means frontier in Arab). An important factor of its growth was the construction of railways in the beginning of the 20th century, which led to rapid growth.
