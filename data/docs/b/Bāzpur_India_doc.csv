Bazpur is well connected with the industrial city of Rudrapur and the historical city of Kashipur. It is an affluent town, mainly due to large agricultural estates. It was initially, like most of the area which forms present day Udham Singh Nagar District, a part of the Terai, and was gradually transformed into arable land by migrants from Punjab.
