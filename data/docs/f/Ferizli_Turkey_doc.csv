== City of Sakarya ==
Adapazarı was a village named "Ada" in 1573, a sub-district in 1646, a village inside Akyazı in 1658, administrative district of a qadi in 1692, and again a sub-district in 1742. The residency area had the status of a district for 117 years between 1837 and 1954 during the Ottoman and Republican eras. Adapazarı, being a district of Kocaeli for many years, separated from Kocaeli and took the name "Sakarya" on June 22, 1954 by the law number 6419. After Adapazarı took the name Sakarya as being the center of the districts Akyazı, Geyve, Hendek and Karasu, on December 1, 1954 the first governor Nazım Üner began active duty with ceremonies.


== Sakarya Metropolitan Municipality ==
While Adapazarı was experiencing a rapid growth and great development in the center of Akova, the city had to face a great destruction during the great Marmara earthquake on August 17, 1999. 3891 residents lost their lives while 26,551 buildings collapsed and almost 100,000 people were left homeless. The city was trying to be reborn from its ashes with the help of state/people collaboration when Adapazarı Municipality which was founded in 1868 gained the status of Metropolitan Municipality on March 6, 2000 by publication of the council of the ministers' enactment number 593 on the Official Journal. Already present Adapazarı Mayor Aziz Duran was brought to Adapazarı Metropolitan Mayor Office. With the legal amendments made in 2004 and 2008 the range and service area of the Metropolitan Municipality were extended. In 2008 legislation was passed to change the name of Adapazarı Metropolitan Municipality to Sakarya Metropolitan Municipality to prevent confusion. Sakarya Metropolitan Municipality is in service with its 16 districts and more than 870,000 people.
