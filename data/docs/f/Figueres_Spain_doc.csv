=== International negotiator ===
Representing the Government of Costa Rica, Christiana Figueres was a negotiator of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change 1995–2010. In 1997 she provided critical international strategy for achieving developing country support and approval of the Kyoto Protocol and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). From 2007 to 2009 she was Vice President of the Bureau of the Climate Convention, representing Latin America and the Caribbean. Over the years she chaired various international negotiations:

Member of the Friends of the Chair Group that negotiated the Bali Action Plan for long term cooperative action of all nations, Bali, Indonesia, December 2007.


=== Programmatic Clean Development Mechanism ===
In 2002 Figueres proposed a "Sectoral CDM" under which developing countries would be encouraged to develop regional or sectoral projects that may be the result of specific sustainable development policies. In 2005 she published a study proposing "programmatic CDM" whereby emission reductions are achieved not by one single site, but rather by multiple actions executed over time as the result of a government measure or a voluntary program.In December 2005 Figueres took the idea to the COP11 in Montreal, and achieved support for it on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. She then took the lead in negotiating the concept with the various groups of industrialized countries, finally attaining a COP decision to allow "programs of activities" in the CDM. Two years later, as member of the CDM Executive Board, she achieved consensus on the rules and procedures for the submission of "programs of activities" in the CDM.

== United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ==
Following the failed COP15 climate change conference in Copenhagen, the UN Secretary General appointed Christiana Figueres as new Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, starting her first term in July 2010. Upon starting the role, she advocated for a shift in strategy: not going for 'all or nothing', but instead trying to progress in small steps.During her tenure as Executive Secretary, she led the UN Climate Change Secretariat's delivery of six consecutive yearly global negotiation sessions, culminating in the historical Paris Agreement in December 2015. Her engagement and close collaboration with yearly rotating presidencies (Mexico, South Africa, Qatar, Poland, Peru and France) provided the necessary framework and continuity that allowed every annual negotiation to build incrementally solid ground of common purpose.

Under the presidency of Patricia Espinosa (Mexico) COP16 in 2010 marked a radical departure from the previous conference in Copenhagen, delivering a comprehensive package infrastructure to assist developing nations including the Green Climate Fund, the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism, and the Cancun Adaptation Framework.At COP17 held in Durban in December 2011, governments committed for the first time to collectively developing a new universal climate change agreement by 2015 for the period beyond 2020. Connie Hedegaard, the EU's top climate official, played a pivotal role to change the course of negotiations.The work toward that global legal framework was initiated at COP18 Doha in November 2012, at the same time as the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was adopted under the Doha Amendment. At COP19 in Warsaw in 2013 governments continued to work toward the global framework but also adopted a rulebook for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and a mechanism to address loss and damage caused by long-term climate change impacts. Gathering in Lima for COP20 at the end of 2014, governments defined the core elements of the upcoming agreement, and agreed on the ground rules to submit national contributions in the run up to the 2015 negotiation.


=== Paris agreement ===

COP21 held in Paris in December 2015 is widely recognized as a historic achievement. With the leadership of the United Nations Secretary-General and President Hollande of France, and beating previous records of Head of State gatherings on one day, 155 Heads of State came together to send a strong political signal of support for an ambitious and effective agreement. On the final day under the presidency of Laurent Fabius the 195 governments which are Parties to the Climate Change Convention unanimously adopted the Paris Agreement, with the goal of accelerating the intentional transformation of the global economy toward low carbon and high resilience. Figueres and the French hosts had made sure the major negotiation obstacles were resolved before the start of the Agreement.Figueres spent much of her tenure approaching key stakeholders beyond governments by engaging insurance companies, the science community, faith groups, youth and women's groups, and other members of society, encouraging them to partake in the global efforts to address climate change. In 2013, she addressed the World Coal Association, commented that the coal industry faces risks in adjusting to climate change, but inviting them to be a part of the global solution.Christiana Figueres completed her second term as Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC on 6 July 2016.


== Post-UNFCCC career ==

After her tenure as Executive Secretary, she has worked as convenor of Mission 2020 and served as chair of the Advisory Board of the Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change. She has served on the board of the Spanish infrastructure and energy corporation Acciona since 2017. She is a founder of the Global Optimism group.


=== United Nations Secretary-General candidacy ===

On 7 July 2016, Christina Figueres became the official Costa Rican candidate for the United Nations Secretary General. She was an early frontrunner, but decided to withdraw in September after garnishing insufficient support in the third and fourth round of voting.During the UN Secretary General debate held by Al Jazeera, Christina Figuerres raised her hand when the candidates were all asked who thought victims of cholera deserved an apology. The UN's role in the Haiti cholera outbreak has been widely discussed and criticized. There is evidence that the UN peacekeepers was the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Thirty-seven human rights organizations signed a UN Secretary General accountability pledge asking the candidates to take action on two human rights violations that have damaged the United Nations' image: failing to provide remedies for victims of cholera in Haiti, and sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers. Despite her stance at the UNSG debates, her office declined to support the pledge."
