On the national level, Cascade-Fairwood leans towards candidates of the Democratic Party. Democrat John Kerry received about 56 percent of the vote in 2004 to Republican George W. Bush's 43 percent. Despite this, there are a number of pockets where the Republican Party often wins marginal majorities.
The Cascade area (approximately a population of 17,000), which included much of unincorporated Benson Hill north of SE 200 Street and west of 128th Avenue SE, voted to be annexed by the city of Renton in 2007, effective March 1, 2008. The remaining unincorporated area of King County, which is primarily the Fairwood community, has the option of annexing to the city of Renton or incorporating as a city.
In February 2005, the Fairwood Task Force filed a Notice of Intent to Incorporation with King County, to establish a new City of Fairwood. This attempt to incorporate was narrowly defeated in the election held on September 19, 2006. In that election, 48.22% of the votes were for incorporation; a swing of only 136 votes in the election would have changed the result.
The process to form a City of Fairwood was restarted by the Fairwood Municipal Initiative when it filed another Notice of Proposed Incorporation with King County, Washington on April 16, 2007. As of October 2008, the incorporation effort is now under the jurisdiction of the King County Boundary Review Board (BRB) and a consulting firm hired by the BRB is conducting an economic feasibility study for the proposed city of Fairwood.
On November 3, 2009 Proposition 1 to incorporate a city of Fairwood failed again, as it did in 2006.
Efforts are also ongoing to annex the Fairwood area into the city of Renton. Additionally, the Red Mill area of the Fairwood PAA is presently undertaking a separate petition-method annexation.On November 2, 2010, 57.6% of voters voted against a proposition to annex Fairwood to Renton.
