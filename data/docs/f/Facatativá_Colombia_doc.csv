== Etymology ==
The word Facatativá comes from the indigenous Chibcha language spoken by the Muisca who inhabited the area of Facatativá before the Spanish conquest. It has been translated and interpreted differently over time. The historically accepted translation is "fenced fort at the end of the plains" (Cercado fuerte al final de la llanura) although it has also been translated as "fenced fort outside the farming soil" (Cercado fuerte a las afueras de la labranza) This refers to the town being at the edge of the Bogotá savanna.


== History ==
Facatativá traces its history to indigenous cultures of the Andes similar to the ones found in the rest of Latin America. Although there is not an accurate record of the time human activity first took place in that area. Excavations have shown nevertheless that the highlands of Colombia might have been inhabited since the holocene era.
Different records of historic human activity have been found in Facatativá. Evidence of inhabitants of the Herrera Period and Muisca pottery and indigenous paintings and sculptures are samples of their religious beliefs and social structure. The Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park for example features prehistoric paintings, many of them now vandalized.
Facatativá was discovered by the Spanish conquistadors led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, while on the quest for El Dorado. Jiménez de Quesada had his first contact with what is today's Facatativá while trying to capture indigenous Muisca zipa Tisquesusa who intended to escape the Spanish invasion with six hundred men.

However, compared to industrialized countries, broadband internet continues more as an expensive luxury than as a necessary tool for the middle lower class population. The taxes imposed to the imported appliances such as computers continue to make the access to technology very difficult since a person in Colombia would have to pay more for a computer. Telecom has partnered with Mexican company Telmex to provide internet access. There is also competition with the Telephones Company of Bogota (ETB) which was formerly restricted from offering telecommunication services outside Bogota.
