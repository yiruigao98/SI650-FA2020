Finglas (; Irish: Fionnghlas, meaning "clear streamlet") is a northwestern outer suburb of Dublin, Ireland.  It lies close to Junction 5 of the M50 motorway, and the N2 road. Nearby suburbs include Glasnevin and Ballymun; Dublin Airport is 7 km to the north. Finglas lies mainly in the postal district of Dublin 11.
Finglas is the core of a civil parish in the barony of Castleknock.


== Name ==
The name Finglas (Irish: Fionnghlas), meaning clear streamlet, is derived from the Finglas River.


== Geography ==
The centre of Finglas lies on a rise overlooking the valley of the River Tolka, at an altitude of 59m.  Flowing from the north is the stream, the Finglas River, for which it is named, forming in turn from branches from the townlands of Grange and Kildonan to the north.  After meeting a tributary, the St. Margaret's Road Stream, the Finglas flows through the village centre in culvert, and along the eastern side of Finglas Road, joining the Tolka at Finglas Bridge.  To the west of the village centre rises the Finglaswood Stream, which joins the River Tolka via an Integrated Constructed Wetland near a small civic golf course.


== History ==
Finglas was originally the site of an Early Christian abbey, the origin of which has been associated, from early times, with the name of St. Cainnech, or Canice, the patron of Kilkenny, said to have founded it in 560 A.D. The Nethercross from the first abbey can be seen today in the old graveyard. Several primary schools and churches in the area have been named after Canice. According to an ancient legend, the ground on which Finglas stands had been sanctified by St. Patrick, who is said to have uttered a prophecy that a great town would arise at the ford of hurdles in the vale beneath. St. Canice is said to have been born at Glengiven near Derry. The Finglas or Finglass family,  who were prominent in the legal profession and in politics in the sixteenth century, took their name from the district.
Finglas is a civil parish in the barony of Castleknock.
In 1649 the Duke of Ormonde used Finglas as a staging post for his army before launching an unsuccessful Siege of Dublin.
