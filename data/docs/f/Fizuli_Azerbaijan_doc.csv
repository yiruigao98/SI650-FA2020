Fuzuli District (Azerbaijani: Füzuli rayonu) is a rayon of Azerbaijan. It was named after the Azerbaijani poet Fuzûlî. Its capital is the town of Füzuli. 
The western half, including the capital, was controlled by the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as part of the Hadrut Province, since the first Nagorno-Karabakh War. Horadiz is the temporary administrative center due to Fuzuli's occupation by Armenian forces since 23 August 1993. On October 17 2020, most of the occupied portion of the district including the capital Füzüli was announced to be recaptured by Azerbaijan.IDPs from Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions were moved to Fuzuli rayon from tent settlements around the country. The IDPs live in new houses built by the government.
