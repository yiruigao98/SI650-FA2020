The first records of Frattamaggiore date to 921 AD, although the area was probably settled in pre-Roman times.  The people of Atella built a watchtower in response to the Vandal invasion of 455 AD, around which refugees from Miseno settled when their town was razed by the Saracens; here they also built a Catholic temple in honour of Sossius, now the patron saint  of Frattamaggiore.
