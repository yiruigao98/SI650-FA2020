== Origin of the Name and History ==
According to oral tradition the name of the city is linked to the abundance of a fruit similar to the jabuticaba, which was known by the first settlers as only "fruit".  As a result, the place was called Patrimônio das Frutas, later as Carmo do Fructal and today only Frutal.  The first registers mention the arrival of a pioneer Antônio de Paula e Silva in 1835, who settled with his family and slaves on the banks of the Rio Grande.  In 1850 the settlement was declared a "arraial" or village, and in 1858 it was raised to the status of district in the municipality of Uberaba, becoming emancipated in the same year with the name of Carmo do Fructal.  In 1887 it became a city with the name Frutal.
