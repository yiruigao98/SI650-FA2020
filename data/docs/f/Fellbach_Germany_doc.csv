Several landlords had possessions in Fellbach, the House Württemberg bought piece by piece. First, the village belonged to Oberamt Cannstatt. After its dissolution in 1923 Fellbach came to Oberamt Waiblingen, this became in 1938 Waiblingen district. After Fellbach had grown to the largest Württemberg village, the community was named October 14, 1933 for city. After World War II, the population crossed the 20,000 threshold. Therefore, Fellbach was appointed on April 1, 1956 to the district town in the district of Waiblingen.
