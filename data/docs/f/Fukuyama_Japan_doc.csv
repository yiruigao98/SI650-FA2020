== History ==
What is today the city of Fukuyama was founded as a castle town in 1619 by Mizuno Katsunari,  a cousin of shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Mizuno was given command of a territory in western Japan consisting of southern Bingo Province and southwestern Bitchu Province.  He built a new castle-town as his capital and called it Fukuyama.
After the abolition of the han system in 1871, Fukuyama Prefecture was founded. A short time later the prefecture was renamed Fukatsu. Fukatsu Prefecture was merged with Kurashiki Prefecture in 1872 to form Oda Prefecture. In 1875 Oda Prefecture was merged into Okayama Prefecture.
When the border between Hiroshima and Okayama prefectures was re-arranged in 1876, Fukuyama Town became a part of Hiroshima Prefecture.
Fukuyama Town became Fukuyama City on July 1, 1916. The population of the city at that time was 32,356.

On August 8, 1945 (two days after the atomic-bombing of Hiroshima), 91 American B-29 bombers made an air raid on Fukuyama, destroying much of the city.
Fukuyama was named one of the core cities of Japan on April 1, 1998.
