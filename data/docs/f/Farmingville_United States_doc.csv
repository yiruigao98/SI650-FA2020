== History and overview ==
The first settlement in what is now called Farmingville occurred in the late 18th century, and was called Bald Hills and Mooney Ponds, before it eventually was called Farmingville (though the soil and hills are not good for agriculture). The Keibel Family had a 72-acre fruit and vegetable farm from 1950 till 1982. It did not have its own post office until 1950.The home of Elijah Terry, the first teacher in the local school, was built in 1823 and sits next to the Bald Hills Schoolhouse, built in 1850. The schoolhouse is in the National Register of Historic Places.
Bald Hill, one of the highest points on Long Island, is located on the Ronkonkoma Moraine, where the glacier which formed Long Island stopped its advance. At the top of Bald Hill is Vietnam Memorial Park, which includes an obelisk-shaped monument painted red, white, and blue, which was dedicated on Nov. 11, 1991. The Bald Hill Cultural Center features the outdoor Brookhaven Amphitheater and was previously the location of a ski area from 1965â€“1980.

== Immigrant workers ==
Farmingville has been a focal point of controversy regarding the situation of illegal immigrants gathering in large groups on street corners and in front of businesses. Some community members have criticized and protested the lack of immigration-law enforcement, while day laborer supporters have proposed building a hiring hall for day laborers.
In the summer of 2000, two Mexican immigrants were lured into the basement of an abandoned building in Shirley, NY and beaten by two white supremacists. Then, in 2003, four teenagers were arrested for firebombing the home of a Mexican family. The group, Sachem Quality of Life Organization, was formed in response to the influx of illegal immigrants. The dispute was the subject of a 2004 documentary, Farmingville.
