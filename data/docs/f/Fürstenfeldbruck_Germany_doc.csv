== Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base ==

Fürstenfeldbruck has been the site of an Air Base since 1936.   It was used by the Luftwaffe before and during World War II.   It was used by United States Air Force after World War II and returned to the German government in 1957 and used as a base for the modern German Air Force ever since.
The air force base was the site of the Munich Massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics.  The nine Israeli hostages (two had been killed earlier at the Olympic Village) and eight Black September terrorists who captured them were flown to the base from the Olympic Village via helicopter, where the terrorists demanded they, and their hostages, be flown to a friendly Arab nation. After a botched rescue attempt by Bavarian border guards and Munich police, the terrorists killed all of the nine remaining Israeli hostages, who were unable to escape from the helicopters. Five of the terrorists and a Munich policeman were also killed in the gunfight.
