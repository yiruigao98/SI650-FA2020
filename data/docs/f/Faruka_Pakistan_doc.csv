According to elders, before colonial settlement, there was a pond in its western side where a Hindu Yogi (Saadhu) lived due to which the village was also called Saadh wala (سادھ والا).

The Chak was established by the British Government of India after completion of northern branch of Lower Jehlum Canal in 1901 under 1st Colonization Officer of Sargodha Mr. Malcolm Hailey. So it was one of many villages settled in British Colony of Lower Jehlum Canal Sargodha. Initially it was part of Tehsil and District Shahpur. Major population consists of the settlers from Rawalpindi, Jehlum, and Chakwal who were rewarded agriculture land in turn of their services rendered for the British Army. As they got monthly pension for their service so were also called "Pensioners" (پنسلی) in local language. The second major portion came  from Indian Punjab after partition in 1947 therefore called Muhajirs. Most of them were Raajput (راجپوت) by caste and were allotted houses of the Hindus who resided here before partition, The last settlement was made for affected families of Mangla Dam (AJK) around 1970 and therefore called Mangla Demis. Most of Baloch families migrated from the inundated area of River Jehlum who timely were displaced due to flood but afterwards became permanent residents.
