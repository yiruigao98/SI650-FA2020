== History ==
Fastiv is a historical city that survived through Cossack uprisings and the Great Turkish War with the period of total devastation and later resettlement. 
In September 1919, a pogrom of the Jewish population of Fastiv was carried out by Denikin's White Army forces; about 1,800 people were murdered and about 8,000 died in the following year from wounds or epidemics. In 1941 the German Einsatzgruppe C under Paul Blobel murdered all Fastiv Jews between the ages of 12 and 60.

Historical landmarks include the Intercession Church (Ukrainian: Pokrovska Tserkva; Intercession of the Theotokos Church) - a 17th-century Orthodox church, also known as Paliy Church (after the Cossack leader Semen Paliy). There is also an early 20th-century Catholic church.
