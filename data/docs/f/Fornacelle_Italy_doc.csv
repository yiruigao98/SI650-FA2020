Autumn is the rainiest season, with October, November and December being the wettest months of the year; on average 14 inches (355 mm) of rain falls in those three months.
Winters are cool to cold, but rather short, lasting from mid/late December to late February or March, depending on years. Rain is usual and temperature stand in the mid 40s (6-10°C) at night and in the low 50s (10-13°) during the day. It is common to have sunny and mild days even in the middle of January. Snowfall is occasional at higher elevations, in the town centre is rare and accumulations are even rarer, frost happens generally once every several years. The coldest month is January but recent winters had seen cold episodes in late February.
In March the weather is changeable, often windy and cool, sometimes rainy, sometimes sunny, temperatures between the mid/upper 40s (6-9°C) and the upper 50s or low 60s (14-17°C). Episodes of cold ( high of 41°F (5°C) on 22 March 2017) or warmth ( high of 72°F (22°C) on 7 March 2019) have been recorded throughout the month.
Spring is very pleasant with temperatures in the 50s (10-15°C) at night and between the lower 60s and lower 70s at daytime (16-22°C). Rainfall is less frequent from March all over to June but not uncommon. In May the first thunderstorms of the "cherry season" occur.
The highest temperature ever recorded was 97.5 °F (36.4°C) on 10 August 2017; the lowest was 29.1°F (-1.6°C) on 31 December 2014. The area suffered from extreme drought during the latter half of 2016 and all of 2017, a year when numerous wildfires destroyed much of forest cover on Mt. Vesuvius.

Due to climate change, Vico Equense is experiencing cold and hot extremes like it has never seen before, along with drought and heavy rainfall or hail in such severe storms that are unprecedented in the region's meteorological history. For example, record cold and unusual snowfall, prolonged periods of muggy and hot weather during the summer or the wind storm of 29 October 2018 when the highest wind speed and gust ever recorded occurred: respectively 44 knots (51 mph)(82 km/h) and 60 knots (69 mph) (111 km/h).


== History ==

A 7th century pre-Roman necropolis has been found in the area. Later, when it was called Latin: Aequana  Roman patricians chose it for their villas. After a long decline, the center started to flourish again in the late 13th century, when it became independent from the Duchy of Sorrento and King Charles II of Naples repeatedly sojourned in the town, where he also built a castle (1301). To this period also date the Cathedral, the only example of Gothic Cathedral in the Sorrentine Peninsula.
Vico Equense was the birthplace of the playwright and dabbler in natural magic Giambattista Della Porta (1535-1615).
The great Russian dancer, Violetta Elvin, born Prokhorova, lives with her family in Vico Equense, where she took refuge in 1956 after abandoning a successful career in all theatres of the world. Her career will be reconstructed in the biographical novel by Raffaele Lauro entitled "Dance The Love – A Star in Vico Equense", to be published by GoldenGate Edizioni in 2016.
Bruce Springsteen's maternal grandfather was from Vico Equense. He dedicated the song "My Hometown" to the place.


== Monuments and places of interest ==

The Church of the Annunciation was the cathedral of the Diocese of Vico Equense, until 1818, when it was abolished. Built in the early 14th century on a clifftop overlooking the sea, it is an example of Gothic architecture, while the facade is in Baroque style.
The Antiquarium Silio Italico is an archaeological museum founded in 1966 that collects mainly funerary objects found in a necropolis, discovered in Vico Equense during the construction of some buildings in the 1960 and 1970.
The Campanian Mineralogic Museum, founded in 1992, had originally on display a collection of mineral samples donated by Pasquale Discepolo, a local engineer. As the years went by the museum has further enriched its collections, adding various display sections dedicated to gemstones, paleontology and even anthropology. The museum is one of the most important Campanian science museums.Among the natural attractions of the area is the  Scrajo spa, founded in 1895. At the spa they offer therapies for various diseases, thanks to the several sources of sulfur water that feed into the center. The complex is also used for beach tourism, thanks to its proximity to the sea.
