Friedrichsfelde (German pronunciation ) is a German locality (Ortsteil) within the borough (Bezirk) of Lichtenberg, Berlin.


== History ==
The locality was first mentioned in a document of 1265 with the name of Rosenfelde. In 1699 it was renamed Friedrichsfelde after the Prince-Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. It was an autonomous municipality of the former Niederbarnim district until 1920, when it merged into Berlin under the "Greater Berlin Act".
