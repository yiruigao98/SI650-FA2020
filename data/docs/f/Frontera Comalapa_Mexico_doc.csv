In March 2012, authorities discovered the remains of at least 167 people in a cave at a ranch in Frontera Comalapa. A subsequent investigation revealed the remains date back to the pre-Columbian era, between 700 and 1200. There were no obvious signs of violence, and officials believe the cave was previously used as a cemetery. A number of clay works were also recovered.
