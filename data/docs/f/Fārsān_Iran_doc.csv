Farsan or Pharsāṇ (Gujarati: ફરસાણ, Hindi and Marathi: फरसाण) refers to salty snacks originating from the Indian subcontinent. Farsans are a very important part of Gujarati cuisine, Rajasthani cuisine and Sindhi cuisine, wherein a wide variety of them are prepared on special occasions and to entertain guests, and are also enjoyed with tea.

== History ==
When India was undivided, the State of Sindh was under Bombay Presidency also called Bombay and Sindh. Due to its proximity with Gujarat, Rajasthan and political ties with then Bombay, it shared similar culinary traditions. Though Farsan is highly adopted in Gujarati cuisines but origin is same. Sindhis in Ulhasnagar have preserved this tradition in the form of few special dishes like Batan Papdi, Sev Dal Sandwich, Dahi Sev Puri, etc.
