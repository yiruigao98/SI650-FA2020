Franceville is one of the four largest cities in Gabon, with a population of 110,568 at the 2013 census. It lies on the River Mpassa and at the end of the Trans-Gabon Railway and the N3 road. It grew from a village named Masuku when Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza chose it to resettle former slaves and renamed it Francheville (meaning "city of the freed") in 1880. The city later came to be called Franceville.


== Overview ==
Brazza founded Franceville on June 13, 1880. The former name was Masuku. As time went on, it became known as Franceville.Features of the town include St Hilaire's Church (built in 1899), a large statue of President Omar Bongo (who was born in Franceville), a primate medical research institute, and a golf course. Its airport is 20 km west, in Mvengué.
There is a market where numerous items can be purchased, including clothing, fruit and vegetables, electronics, meats, and the market also sells bushmeat, which includes African Rock Python, monkey and local species of animals.
Franceville's infrastructure is overall of better quality than the rest of the country, most probably because of the city's significance.
There are a few hotels, of which the best known is the Hotel Poubara, overlooking the President's holiday home.
Franceville also has many waterfalls. One of the best known is the Poubara Falls, which is co-located with a hydroelectric plant that provides the area with constant electricity. President Omar Bongo was buried in Franceville on June 18, 2009.
