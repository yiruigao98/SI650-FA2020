== History ==
The area of modern Futtsu has been inhabited since the Japanese Paleolithic period, and numerous remains from the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun period have been found within the city limits. The area also is prominent in the Yamatotakeru mythology. Under the Ritsuryō system of the Nara period, the area became part of Amaha County and Sue County of Kazusa Province. Large scale shōen in the Heian period gave way to feudal samurai estates in the Kamakura period, with large portions controlled by the temple of Shomyo-ji in Mutsuura. The area was contested between the Takeda clan and Satomi clan during the Sengoku period. During the Edo period under the Tokugawa shogunate, most of the area was under the control of Sanuki Domain. After the Meiji Restoration, the area came under Kimitsu District
Futtsu Town was founded on December 1, 1897. It expanded through merger with neighboring Aoyagi Town on March 31, 1955, and again through merger with Amaha Town and Osawa Town on April 25, 1971. Futtsu attained city status on September 1, 1971.
According to Victory at Sea (H. Saloman and R. Hanser, Doubleday, 1959), Futtsu was on August 30, 1945 the site of the initial Allied landing on the Japanese mainland following the declared surrender. This was a test whether the Japanese would obey the Emperor's surrender order.  There was no resistance.
