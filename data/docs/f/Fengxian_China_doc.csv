== Overview ==
Nanqiao is a major town in Fengxian district, which recent development has more than doubled in size. Of particular interest is Guhua Park which contains the "Three Women Temple" or "Ancestral Hall" (三女祠; Sān Nǚ Cí). During the Zhou dynasty, the King of Wu's three daughters hanged themselves rather than be caught by the King of Yue's soldiers.  The town is also a short taxi ride from Xinghai Beach and its resorts, also slated for development.  Nanqiao has a 1000-bed medical center, the Fengxian District Central Hospital, which is an all-discipline tertiary hospital.Nanqiao is about 30 minutes from downtown Shanghai by car or about 1–2 hours by public transit. It can be reached by taking the Line 1 subway to Xinzhuang and transferring to the Line 5 subway to Dongchuan Road. Alternatively, one can transfer to the Xinnan Bus at Xinzhuang, the Nanmei Line (南梅线) from Jinjiang Park to Nanqiao Bus Station (南桥汽车站), or the Shangfeng Bus at the Shanghai South Railway Station Station's South Square.
