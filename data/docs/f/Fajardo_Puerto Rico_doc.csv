Fajardo (Spanish pronunciation: [faˈxaɾðo]) is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the east region of the island, facing the Atlantic Ocean, north of Ceiba and east of Luquillo. Fajardo is spread over 7 barrios and Downtown Fajardo (commonly called by the locals "Fajardo Pueblo"), which serves as the administrative center. It is both a principal part of the Fajardo Metropolitan Statistical Area and the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area.
Fajardo is the hub of much of the recreational boating in Puerto Rico and a popular launching port to Culebra, Vieques, and the American and British Virgin Islands. It is also home to the largest Marina in the Caribbean, called Puerto del Rey. The town contains various hotels and inns.
Off shore, near Fajardo, a few islets can be found. These are Icacos, Palominos, Palominito, and Diablo, among other uninhabited coral islands.


== History ==
Fajardo was founded in 1760, 1773 or 1774 (depending on the authority) as Santiago de Fajardo. It was one of the locations used by the Americans to invade Puerto Rico. On August 1, 1898 the USS Puritan under the command of Captain Frederic W. Rodgers, was sailing by the coastline of the city of Fajardo, when Rogers noticed the "Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan" (Cape San Juan lighthouse) which was supposed to be the landing site for the US Army in Puerto Rico. Rodgers ordered some of his men ashore, which included Puerto Rican volunteers, with the mission of posting the American Flag atop the lighthouse.
When after the Treaty of Paris (1898), the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Fajardo was 16,782.
