== Geography and climate ==
Floridablanca is situated at an altitude of about 925 metres (3,035 ft) in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, though locally the topography varies greatly. To the east of the city the higher mountains of the Andes rise above the city, thrusted upwards by the north–south-trending Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault, one of the major megaregional faults of Colombia. The area is dominated by the Bucaramanga Nest, the second-most seismically active region in the world. Because of the relatively low altitude, the city enjoys a very favorable climate all year round. Floridablanca's climate is classified as tropical. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall. The climate is classified as Aw (tropical savanna climate) by the Köppen-Geiger system. The average annual temperature is 23.6 °C (74.5 °F) in Floridablanca. The rainfall averages 1,055 millimetres (41.5 in) per year.


== Geology and biology ==
The surrounding areas of urban Floridablanca are composed of the Jurassic Girón and Jordán Formations, to the east of the Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault, running north–south in the east of the municipality, the Precambrian Bucaramanga Gneiss and Early Jurassic La Corcova Quartzmonzonite crop out and the Ruitoque Massif comprises the Tambor Formation.The rural areas surrounding the city are home to the endemic San Gil climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa nicefori).


== History ==

Before the Spanish conquest, the area of Floridablanca was populated by the Guane. The Guane were submitted to the rule of the Spanish Empire by conquistador Martín Galeano when he founded Vélez in 1539, until then part of the Muisca Confederation. Modern Floridablanca was founded on November 7, 1817 as "Floridablanca de San Juan Nepomuceno" by Javier Guerra de Mier. The church of San Juan Nepomuceno finished construction in 1832.

Commerce was the most important sector with 39% of the economical make-up, industrial production of clothing was nearly 10% and the food and drinks industry comprised 7% of the economical activities. The production of sweets, and especially the traditional Colombian dessert of obleas, has given Floridablanca the name "the sweet municipality of Colombia".The central part of the city hosts a concentration of malls; Cañaveral, constructed in 1984, and Parque Caracolí, inaugurated in 2013.The city, in recent years grown to connect with Bucaramanga, forms the entry point to the Chicamocha Canyon, located at an hour drive from the city, and hosts touristic activities with a paragliding school on the Mesa de Ruitoque, the Ruitoque Massif in the southwest of the city. Local buses to tourist hotspots as San Gil and the Chicamocha Canyon leave from a transport station called "Papi Quiero Piña" ("Dad, I want pineapple").
