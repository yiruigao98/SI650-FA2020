Flower Mound is an incorporated town located in Denton and Tarrant counties in the U.S. state of Texas. Located northwest of Dallas and northeast of Fort Worth adjacent to Grapevine Lake, the town derives its name from a prominent 12.5-acre (5.1 ha) mound located in the center of town.
After settlers used the site for religious camps during the 1840s, the area around Flower Mound was first permanently inhabited in the 1850s; however, residents did not incorporate until 1961. Although an effort to create a planned community failed in the early 1970s, Flower Mound's population increased substantially when Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport opened to the south in 1974. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 64,699, reflecting a 28% increase over the 50,702 counted in the 2000 Census.Flower Mound's municipal government, operating under a council–manager system, has invested in a public park system highlighted by an extensive network of trails. The town's public schools comprise part of the Lewisville Independent School District. With its moderately affluent population and proximity to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Flower Mound has used a smart growth system for urban planning, and has recently experienced more rapid light industrial growth to match the growing needs of the primarily residential community. In 2012, Flower Mound was ranked at #8 as one of the Best Dallas Suburbs according to D Magazine.


== History ==
Settlement in the area around Flower Mound began when the Presbyterians established a camp in the area in the 1840s. A log cabin, dated around 1850, was discovered preserved within the walls of a home near Liberty Elementary in 2016, providing further proof of settlement. At first, the group held religious camps for two to three weeks at a time. By 1854, residents had established the Flower Mound Presbyterian Church southwest of Lewisville in an area commonly referred to as "Long Prairie". By 1920, the church had 126 members, and the pine-framed building was expanded in 1937. Early settlers such as Andrew Morriss and David Kirkpatrick are memorialized with street names in the town. The area remained sparsely populated for many decades after its initial settlement.
On February 25, 1961, the town voted to incorporate to avoid annexation by the City of Irving. William Wilkerson, who became the town's second mayor, led the incorporation effort and helped improve the town's phone service and water supply. In 1970, when Flower Mound had 1,685 residents, Edward S. Marcus and Raymond Nasher began a planned community project with $18 million in loan guarantees from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development through their New Community program. Called "Flower Mound New Town", the project included elements of the new towns movement, including collaboration with North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) to move the school's administrative offices to Flower Mound and conduct all research for the project. The project was featured in advertisements as late as 1974, but it was abandoned after residents threatened to disannex a portion of the town to thwart the development. The disannexation effort sharply divided the town, and led to a number of strongly contested elections between 1971 and 1976. In 1976, Texas Monthly awarded the project its "Bum Steer Award" after the project lost its federal loan guarantees.The construction of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the town in 1974 sparked a period of rapid growth. Between 1980 and 1990, Flower Mound's population increased from 4,402 to 15,896. It reached 50,702 in 2000, an average annual increase of nearly 13 percent per year during the 1990s, making it the nation's tenth fastest-growing community. Between 2000 and 2002, Flower Mound was the ninth fastest-growing municipality in the United States with a population of more than 50,000, and its population continued to increase by approximately five percent each year between 2000 and 2005. Controlled growth continues in central and western Flower Mound.


== Geography ==
Flower Mound is located approximately 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Dallas and 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Fort Worth on the border between Denton and Tarrant counties. The town is located almost entirely in Denton County, however it has areas that extend into Tarrant County. It is situated on the basin of the Trinity River in the Eastern Cross Timbers subregion in Texas. The town borders Lewisville to the east and a number of cities and towns to the north, including Highland Village, Double Oak, and Bartonville. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 43.4 square miles (112 km2). Land comprises 41.39 square miles (107.2 km2) (95.37%) of the total area; Denton County soils include the Silawa, Nawo, Gasil series. Water comprises 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2) (5.76%) of the total area; Grapevine Lake and Marshall Creek form much of the town's southern boundary. Flower Mound's climate is classified as humid subtropical; the city averages 233 sunny days per year and 79 days of precipitation.The town encourages conservation development projects to protect and preserve existing open space, vistas, and natural habitats while allowing for controlled growth. Much of the town is located on the Barnett Shale, and drilling for shale gas in close proximity to residential neighborhoods has sharply divided parts of the community. In 1994, amateur fossil collector Gary Byrd discovered a fossilized example of a Hadrosaurid dinosaur among black shale rock formations in the southwest edge of the town near Grapevine Lake. The fossilized creature from the Cenomanian age was named "Protohadros byrdi" in Byrd's honor.


=== The Mound ===
Flower Mound was named for a 12.5-acre (5.1 ha) hill approximately 50 feet (15 m) in height located close to the intersection of FM 3040 and FM 2499. The formation attracted the attention of early settlers to the area, and is often simply referred to as "The Mound". Part of the Texas blackland prairies, The Mound is typically covered by big bluestem, little bluestem, and Indian grasses. During blooming seasons, dozens of varieties of flowers can grow on its slopes, often aided by the water retained by gilgai formations. Though surrounded by commercial and residential development, The Mound is owned and maintained by The Mound Foundation, a non-profit private–public partnership. The group has advocated for a controlled burn on The Mound for many years, and it expressed relief when an accidental New Year's Eve fire in late 2011 spurred the growth of wildflowers for the first time in years.


== Government ==
The Town of Flower Mound has been a home rule municipality since 1981, and it has operated under a council–manager type of municipal government since 1989. Residents elect five at-large members to the Flower Mound Town Council and one mayor. Members serve two-year terms. In 1999, the town adopted a Strategically Managed And Responsible Town (SMART) Growth Program to manage both the rate and character of development in the community, and in 2000, the town officially adopted its SMARTGrowth management plan. The program's goal was to create environmentally sensitive development and to mitigate the effects of urban sprawl. Political scientist Allan Saxe and attorney Terrence S. Welch have used Flower Mound's program as an example of a municipality attempting to slow growth. In 2013, the town amended the portion of the plan pertaining to public schools; the changes spurred public debate between candidates for town council.According to the city's 2013–2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the city's various funds had $114.6 million in revenues, $101.8 million in expenditures, $513.3 million in total assets, $155.9 million in total liabilities, and $68.1 million in cash and investments.The structure of the management and coordination of city services is led by a town manager, deputy town manager and other roles.


== Parks and recreation ==

The Town of Flower Mound operates 54 public parks and recreation facilities on 693 acres (280 ha) of space, nine of which (comprising 70 acres [28 ha]) are undeveloped as of 2012. In June 2008, the town held the grand opening for its new $13.825 million community activity center, which includes meeting rooms, a day care facility, weight lifting equipment, an outdoor pool, and a 30-by-30-yard (25 m × 22.86 m) competition indoor pool. In honor of Lance Corporal Jacob Lugo, the first military serviceman from Flower Mound to die in the line of duty, the town renamed Hilltop Park to Jake's Hilltop Park in 2008.In 2016 Flower Mound completed and opened its first dog park, a 5-acre Hound Mound Dog Park, costing over $1 million. In 2018 the Town of Flower Mound opened a 2000 sq. ft. splash pad as part of an addition to Heritage Park.


=== Trail system ===
In 1976, in response to environmental concerns and automobile traffic congestion, Flower Mound residents proposed adding a system of recreational bike paths around the town. Initially, funding proved elusive, but by 1989 the first 1.3 miles (2.1 km) of multi-use trails had been constructed, partly funded by a grant from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In 2010, the town maintained 33 miles (53 km) of paved hiking and bicycling paths and 2 miles (3.2 km) of equestrian trails.  The Purple Cone Flower trail starts in Stone Creek Park and is used by runners, walkers and dog walkers.
Additionally, the United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains 14 miles (23 km) of natural surface trails and 9 miles (14 km) of equestrian trails within the town limits, most of which are located around Grapevine Lake. The North Shore trail starts at Rock Ledge Park and travels west through Murrell Park and Twin Coves Park.  A dirt and rock surface trail used predominantly by mountain bikers (see DORBA.org), hikers, trail runners and dog walkers.
