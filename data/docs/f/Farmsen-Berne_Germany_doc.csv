Farmsen-Berne is a quarter of Hamburg, Germany, in the borough of Wandsbek. More than 34,000 inhabitants live in an area of 8.3 km2. Farmsen (German pronunciation: [ˈfaʁmzn̩] (listen)) and Berne (German pronunciation: [ˈbɛʁnə] (listen)) are part of the area of Walddörfer (lit. forest villages).


== Geography ==
Farmsen-Berne borders the quarters of Rahlstedt, Tonndorf, Wandsbek, Bramfeld, Sasel, and Volksdorf. The stream of Berner Au flows through Farmsen-Berne and, behind the pond of Kupfermühlenteich, into Wandse river. 


== History ==
In 1296, the former villages of Farmsen and Berne were first mentioned. Farmsen was then called Vermerschen, deriving of Fridumareshusen or Fridumaresheim, founded by a Franconian settler named Fridumar. The name Berne has its origin in Baren, meaning a small stream - Berner Au in this case. Farmsen-Berne was an exclave of Hamburg in Prussian territory. In 1937, the villages were incorporated into Hamburg by the Greater Hamburg Act, which came into force in 1938.


== Transportation ==
Hamburg U-Bahn line U1, the former Walddörfer railway, was built since 1912 in the area and has three stops in Farmsen-Berne: Trabrennbahn, Farmsen, Oldenfelde and Berne, of which Farmsen station is the largest. It has four tracks, and a railway repair workshop is located here.
