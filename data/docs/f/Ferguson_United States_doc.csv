What is now the city of Ferguson was founded in 1855, when William B. Ferguson deeded 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land to the Wabash Railroad in exchange for a new depot and naming rights. The settlement that sprang up around the depot was called Ferguson Station. Ferguson was the first railroad station connected directly to St. Louis. The station is a focal point of the city's history and is depicted on the city flag, designed in 1994.Ferguson's first schoolhouse was built in 1878. Ferguson was incorporated as a city in 1894.Emerson Electric moved its headquarters to Ferguson during the 20th century.Until the 1960s, Ferguson was a sundown town where African Americans were not allowed to remain after nightfall.Ferguson made frequent worldwide headlines for months following the 2014 killing of Michael Brown Jr. by a police officer and the ensuing civil unrest. The United States Department of Justice investigation which followed resulted in large legal fees for the town, in excess of $300,000 a year.
