Fasano (Italian pronunciation: [faˈzaːno]; Barese: Fasciànë) is a town and comune in the Province of Brindisi, Apulia, southern Italy. It is the second most populated town of the province after Brindisi, and has a population (2016) of 40,227.


== History ==

According to a folk etymology, the name Fasano derives from the "Faso", a large wild columbus dove (also represented on the civic coat of arms) which drank from the fogge, which was a type of swamp or pool in the open air formed from the water that flowed down from the surrounding hills. This area where the pool once was is now a communal garden.
Via Appia, the road used to go from Brindisi to Rome during ancient times runs along Fasano's costal frazioni, including Savelletri and is visible today.
