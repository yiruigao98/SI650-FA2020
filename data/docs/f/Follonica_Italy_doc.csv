It was founded in 1834 by Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany for the workers of a new ironworks plant. However, the area was already settled in Etruscan and Roman times, and a medieval castle (Castello di Valli), whose ruins overlook now  the modern town from a nearby hill, existed since at least 884. Until 1923 it was a frazione of Massa Marittima.
