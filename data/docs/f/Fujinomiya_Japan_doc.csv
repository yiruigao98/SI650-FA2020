Fujinomiya is an ancient settlement, developing as a market town associated with the Ichinomiya, or supreme Shinto shrine of Suruga Province, the Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha (富士山本宮浅間大社). Nearby is the sanctuary of Taisekiji temple, founded in 1290 by Nikko Shonin as the headquarters of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism.  Fujinomiya was a post town (fortified during the Sengoku period) on the primary route connecting Suruga with Kai Province. During the Edo period, the area was tenryō territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. British consul Sir Rutherford Alcock made the first recorded ascent on Mount Fuji by a non-Japanese person from Fujinomiya in 1860.
