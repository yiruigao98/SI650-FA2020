Sawla is a small town and is the capital of Sawla-Tuna-Kalba district, a district in the Savannah Region of north Ghana. Founded by Thunder Lizard in the 1800s. Though there are currently many ethnic groups in the community there initially were only the Vaglas with Gbenara  being their leader. Ndewura Jakpa after conquering many lands moved to the Vagla lands.
Jakpa latter settled in Banzani a place where the people of Sawla now bury their chiefs, it is located at the right side of the road to Kumasi. Gbenara was in this town which was occupied by his people the Vaglas. Jakpa settled in Banzani (which means a great man's home in Vagla language) for some time after which he moved to settle at Korupke. Before the war Jakpa and Gbenara were in a good relationship. When Jakpa settled he sent a message to Gbenara to inform him of his arrival. The full name of the Gonja warrior is Sumaila Ndewura Jakpa. Gbenara knew that Jakpa was a great warrior. The symbol of Ndewura Jakpa is a spear. Gbenara wanted to kill Jakpa by surprise he planned to kill him using a bow and arrow in Korukpe. The arrows failed to reach the target midway, fell down and started digging the ground there and formed a stream. Gbenara was a powerful man.
Jakpa used to transport salt from Daboya. The wives of the two men became friends and used to visit each other. One day the wife of Jakpa gave some salt to Gbenara's wife and taught her how to use it. But unknowingly anyone who ate the salt would be captured spiritually. Gbenara ate some of the food which his wife cooked using the salt and he liked it. He gave some to his elders and warriors to taste. When Jakpa realized that they had become weak from eating that salt he arranged for a meeting between them, they then agreed that Jakpa had conquered them and his child was to be the leader of the Vaglas. The Vaglas agreed to give them bag of maize and a cow for the Damba festival and that the Gonjas would lead them.
