Friedrichshagen is a German locality (Ortsteil) within the Berlin borough (Bezirk) of Treptow-Köpenick. Until 2001 it was part of the former borough of Köpenick.


== History ==
The colony of Friedrichsgnade was founded on May 29, 1753 by King Frederick II of Prussia. Autonomous Prussian municipality of the former Niederbarnim district until 1920, it merged into Berlin with the "Greater Berlin Act." From 1949 to 1990, like the rest of the borough of Köpenick, it was part of East Berlin.
