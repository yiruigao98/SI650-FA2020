== History ==
From 660 to 760, Fuman functioned as the seat of the Zoroastrian Dabuyid rulers. During the period of the Mongol occupation of Iran, Fuman and Lahijan were among the main towns of Gilan. The local ruler of Fuman at that time, who was reportedly the "only Shafi'ite among the rulers of Gilan", was able to generate a large amount of revenue through lucrative silk trade. According to Hamdallah Mustawfi (died 1349), Fuman was a large city, and the center of a wealthy region which produced large quantities of "wheat, rice and silk".Fuman continued to function as the capital of the Bia-pas region (western Gilan) until 1572–1573, when ruler Jamshid Soltan made Rasht the capital. From the reign of King (Shah) Sultan Husayn (r. 1694–1722) to Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1797–1834), the local rulers of Fuman were involved in a fierce rivalry with the local rulers of neighboring Shaft. John Elton, who had been prominent under Nader Shah (r. 1736–1747), was killed in 1751 on the order of one of these rulers, Agha Jamal Fumani. In 1805, during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, Fuman was reportedly "still a small, open town with about a thousand houses and a very lively market". However, the situation changed when Hajji Mohammad Khan abandoned Fuman for Rasht during the early reign of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848–1896). In the subsequent period, Fuman "fell into decay". According to Grigorii Melgunov, who visited Fuman in 1860, it was little more than a village consisting of just 140 houses surrounding the palace of the local ruler. Fuman has regained importance since the mid-20th century.
