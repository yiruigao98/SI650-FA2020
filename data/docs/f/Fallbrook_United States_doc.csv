This is a list of the largest megachurches in the United States with an attendance of more than 2,000 weekly. The Hartford Institute's database lists more than 1,300 such Protestant and Evangelical churches in the United States. According to that data, approximately 50 churches on the list have attendance ranging from 10,000 to 47,000.When it has more than 10,000 people who gather together, the term gigachurch is sometimes used.As the term megachurch in common parlance refers to Protestant congregations, although there are some Catholic Church parishes which would meet the criteria, they are not listed. About 3,000 Catholic churches have 2,000+ attending each week, which is more than the 2,000 members for listing here. St Ann's in Coppell, Texas, would be near the top, with almost 30,000 registered parishioners.Membership numbers of the following churches give only a very rough indication of size. They vary from year to year. Also, some churches report typical Sunday attendance while others report the number who are listed in church records or make financial contributions, which may be higher. Some of the larger churches are multi-site churches. Many churches deliver their message through television or other media, sometimes reaching much higher numbers than those who physically attend the church.
