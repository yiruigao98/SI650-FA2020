Royal residence made way first for female lunatic convicts and later, from 1987, the open-air correctional home.
Open Air Correctional Home is a relatively new and revolutionary concept.  Situated over 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land and mango garden containing about 1000 mango trees, this Open Air Jail is a correction home for the prisoners.  Convicts sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 7 years or more and such of them as have already served 2/3 of their sentence and have maintained all along a good jail record are eligible for transfer to the open jail after thorough screening and personal interview by a board constituted for such selection.
Surprisingly, inmates get freedom to go out during day time (06:00 hrs to 20:00 hrs). They have their own source of income in the forms of cultivation, goods shops (given by the Prison Authority), Private Tuition. They even get quarters for their families.
