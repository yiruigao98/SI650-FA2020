Los Teques (Spanish pronunciation: [los ˈtekes]) is the capital city of the Venezuelan state of Miranda and the center of the Altos Mirandinos Metropolitan Area. Its population is 140,617 (2001).


== History ==

From 1772 onwards, the Spanish inhabitants of San Pedro de Los Altos began to relocate to a village that had only 99 inhabitants. Five years later, they founded their new settlement as Los Teques on 21 October 1777. The new town's name was derived from the Aractoeques Carabs, an indigenous tribe that once inhabited the area. On February 13, 1927, the capital of the Miranda State was moved to this city from Petare (before being in Petare, the capital of Miranda was in Ocumare del Tuy).
