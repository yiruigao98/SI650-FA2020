== History ==
Labuhan Deli comes from the word "Harbour". Under the authority of the Deli Sultanate, this area is a part of the history of the Deli Kingdom. During the Dutch colonial era this area was a center of trade and other activities. After the independence of the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945 the Deli Kingdom became part of the Deli Serdang Regency, a combination of the Deli Sultanate and the Serdang Sultanate. After the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, the development of rapid growth of the city of Medan as the capital of North Sumatra Province led to an expansion of the city as a center of government, trade and industrial center, so that in 1974 most of the villages in Labuhan Deli District became part of the Medan City administration. From 1974 Labuhan Deli District only consisted of four villages, namely Helvetia Village, Pematang Johar Village, Telaga Tujuh Village and Karang Gading Village. Then in 1995 Helvetia Village was divided into two villages, namely Manunggal and Helvetia Villages so that from 1995 the district consists of five villages listed below with their populations at the 2010 Census:
Helvetia (16,744)
