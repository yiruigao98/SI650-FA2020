== History ==
The village was originally named "Breslau" because the town's original German settlers were from the city of Breslau in Silesia (present-day Wrocław, Poland.) The town was founded in 1873 and renamed Lindenhurst in 1891.On October 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded over half the village's streets. On the southern side of Montauk Highway the water reached up to 6 feet (1.8 m) high. When multiple fires broke out south of Montauk Highway, firefighters were able to contain these fires to their respective dwellings limiting further damage to neighboring houses. Firefighters from most of the Town of Babylon helped control the fires in Lindenhurst. Firefighters fought the blazes in water that was 4 feet high in high spots and 6 feet in lower areas. The people that lived on the northern side of Lindenhurst had no power for over a week. Because of incidents of looting the vacated homes on the south side of Lindenhurst, the police force had to impose limitations. Curfews were enforced, and only people with proof of residency were allowed south of Montauk Highway. After two days the water receded.
