== History ==
The town of Logan was founded in 1859 by settlers sent by Brigham Young to survey for the site of a fort near the banks of the Logan River. They named their new community "Logan" for Ephraim Logan, an early fur trapper in the area. Logan was incorporated on January 17, 1866. Brigham Young College was founded here on August 6, 1877 (and closed in 1926), and Utah State University – then called the Agricultural College of Utah – was founded in 1888.Logan's growth reflects settlement and post-war booms along with other changes incidental to conditions in the West. Logan grew to about 20,000 in the mid-1960s, and according to Census estimates, exceeded 50,000 in 2015.


== Geography and climate ==
Logan is in northern Utah, 47 miles (76 km) north of Ogden, on the Logan River. It is about 82 miles (132 km) north of Salt Lake City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 18.5 square miles (48.0 km2), of which 18.0 square miles (46.5 km2) is land and 0.58 square miles (1.5 km2), or 3.16%, is water.The city lies near the eastern edge of Cache Valley on the western slopes of the Bear River Mountains. Mount Logan rises to an elevation of 9,710 feet (2,960 m) immediately to the east, and south of Logan Canyon. The eastern portions of the city are constructed on top of shelf-like "benches", late Pleistocene sedimentary deposits created by the glacially fed Logan River feeding into the northern stretches of Lake Bonneville, building a "Gilbert-type" river delta over several thousand years. The Logan River later cut down through these sedimentary deposits following the draining of Lake Bonneville approximately 14,500 years ago. This created a low-lying area with very steep slopes that reach into the rest of town and to the Logan River bottomlands. To the west of Logan lie flatlands that contain both farmland and marshes. To the north and south of Logan are rapidly growing residential suburbs.
Logan has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa/Dfb) with very warm though usually dry summers and cold winters with moderate snowfall. Precipitation tends to be heaviest in the spring months. Similar to other areas in northern Utah, during mid-winter high pressure systems often situate themselves over Cache Valley, leading to strong temperature inversions. These temperature inversions trap cold air and pollutants and allow thick smog to accumulate in the valley about three percent of the time. This can result in the worst air pollution levels in the U.S., reducing air quality to unhealthy level.


== Layout ==
Logan's city grid originates from its Main and Center Street block, with Main Street running north and south, and Center east and west. Each block north, east, south, or west of the origin accumulates in increments of 100 (e.g. 100 North, 100 East), though some streets have non-numeric names. This street grid is typical of many towns and cities founded by Latter-day Saints in the Mormon Corridor. Most of Logan's commercial businesses are along Main Street, which spans the entire city.
Logan's downtown area is in the center of the city and is noted for its many historic buildings and landmarks. Among them are the Logan Tabernacle and Logan Utah Temple, which was constructed on the highest hill in the valley so as to be seen for miles in all directions. Both buildings are owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Along Center Street, which intersects Logan's Historic District, are a number of stately houses on the National Register of Historic Places. The downtown area also houses retail and cultural outlets, as well as the municipal and county buildings and courthouses.
The eastern portion of Logan includes the Cliffside and Island neighborhoods, as well as the University district. Utah State University (USU), with its many educational, cultural, agricultural, and athletic programs, was established in 1888. The campus stands on the eastern side of the city, near to the mountains. USU is the city's largest employer, and has an enrollment of about 24,000 students in Logan. Logan Canyon begins in the foothills close to campus.
Logan's southern portion is a mixture of commercial and residential, and contains portions of the Logan River as well as the fairgrounds and aquatic center. The northern area of Logan serves partly as a retail district with numerous shops and restaurants, including the Cache Valley Mall. Logan has the region's largest and most comprehensive hospital, Logan Regional Hospital. The western portion of Logan is set aside as a center for light industry, especially along the area of 1000 West Street, and it also contains residential communities.
