La Unión is a municipality in La Unión Department of El Salvador.
It is the capital city of the department of La Unión. It is the largest city in the department with a population of approximately 34,000 inhabitants. Previously known as Puerto San Carlos, it was renamed La Unión on July 13, 1824 after El Salvador gained independence from Spain and formed the United Provinces of Central America.  La Unión became a department on June 22, 1865, and the city of La Unión became its capital.
In 2005 the Salvadoran government began a new port at La Unión which was to have more than double the cargo capacity of the old and exceed that of El Salvador's principal port at Acajutla. Completed in November 2012, the port has since helped increase local economic growth and stability, though competition from nearby San Miguel remains strong.
