== History and description ==

Lincoln Park itself was one of three original colonial era commons and for a long time the heart of a fashionable residential district, the others being Washington Park and Military Park.  The area is now home to the City Without Walls gallery (cWOW), Newark Symphony Hall and the Newark School of the Arts.The main body of Lincoln Park is bounded by Broad Street and contains several statues including Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, Planting the Standard of Democracy by Charles Henry Niehaus, and Captive's Choice, an historic statue erected in 1884 by Chauncey Ives, an American sculptor living in Rome, Italy. It depicts a young English woman who did not wish to return to her family after being held captive by American Indians during the French and Indian War. 
Lincoln Park also has a healthy and varied array of large, old-growth trees. 
In the early 20th century, the Lincoln Park area was a neighborhood of nightclubs known as "The Coast." It was a center of jazz and a red-light district or "tenderloin" formerly called the Barbary Coast, after San Francisco's neighborhood.The Lincoln Park neighborhood has two community gardens. LPCCD is also planning a large community garden as part of its Fa√ßade project behind the old South Park Calvary United Presbyterian Church, an historically preserved facade.


== The Lincoln Park Music Festival ==
The LPCCD sponsors the annual Lincoln Park Music Festival in July, which since beginning in 2006 has grown to be an event attracting 50,000 spectators. The LPCCD would like to develop the Museum of  American Music. (MoAAM) in recognition of the district's past as a breeding ground for music.


== Revitalization and arts district ==
The district is slowly being revitalized by The Lincoln Park/Coast Cultural District (LPCCD), which states it mission to "develop a sustainable arts community built on affordable housing, green jobs,  music, culture and urban farming 
Newark in the past has been a large producer of  music and continues to produce well-known contemporary artists.  The Coast is being redeveloped to pay homage and recreate on a small scale an area with deep roots in  American music. An "Arts Park" is also in the planning stages in addition to new housing, stores, a restaurant, nightclub, music studio and dance studio.Lincoln Park has been designated an "Arts District" of Newark. While not a comparable artist colony in relation to cities of similar or larger size, Lincoln Park is home to the City Without Walls art gallery; the Newark School of the Arts, a heavily endowed performance and fine arts institution; and Newark Symphony Hall (1020 Broad Street), a venue for music and performing arts events and concerts. Several independent artists focusing on many types of media live in new or rehabilitated housing investments that have been built since 2008 and continue to target spaces to artists. Because there is no organized membership or organization for artists, it is unknown how many artists live in the area. Several million dollars of capital investment has been made over the past 10 years in Lincoln Park, including some of the first LEED and eco-friendly certified buildings in the city.
Lincoln Park is surrounded on three sides by more than a few  small to large in-patient substance abuse rehabilitation facilities for adults and teenagers, mostly suburbanites who are court-sentenced into treatment and rehabilitation. The two main substance abuse treatment centers are CURA, Inc. and Integrity House, both of which operate several men's and women's dormitories as well as out-patient services along the park. Most of these facilities use re-purposed blighted brownstone buildings, former hotels, etc. that were abandoned and in disrepair until they were purchased and rehabilitated into substance abuse treatment facilities. In March 2014, Integrity House opened another 38-bed men's dormitory for in-patient treatment at 49-51 Lincoln Park. This left only a handful of abandoned or blighted structures surrounding Lincoln Park. The Lincoln Park community falls within the East district (or "3rd precinct").
Lincoln Park benefits from its proximity to mixed-use and non-mixed-use properties that include institutional, residential, horticultural, commercial, and educational facilities. Other notable buildings situated along Lincoln Park include:

Colleoni Apartments, also known as Lincoln Park Lofts, (39-41 Lincoln Park) a once blighted seven-story hotel, and  later a tenement transformed into moderate-income housing that opened in 2008 after a multimillion-dollar top-to-bottom rehabilitation by Regan Development Corporation of Ardsley, New York, and now managed by The Michaels Organization of Marlton, New Jersey;
Lincoln Park Towers (31-33 Lincoln Park), an 18-story low- and moderate-income senior living community in an historic highrise that was once The Medical Arts Building, a medical and surgical facility;
Newark School of the Arts (89-91 Lincoln Park);
the Adelaide Sanford Charter School (51-53 Lincoln Park);
the Dryden Mansion, a center for non-profit organizations; and
