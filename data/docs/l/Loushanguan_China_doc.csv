Since early June 2020, heavy rains caused by the regional rainy season led to floods severely affecting large areas of southern China including the Yangtze basin and its tributaries. Rains and floods extended to central and eastern China during July and were described as the worst since at least 1998.According to the Ministry of Emergency Management, by the end of June flooding had displaced 744,000 people across 26 provinces with 81 people missing or dead. As of 13 August, the floods have affected 63.46 million people and caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY, which are 12.7% and 15.5% higher than the 2015-2019 average, respectively. 219 people were found dead or are missing, and 54,000 houses collapsed, which is 54.8% and 65.3% lower than the 2015-2019 average, respectively. The Ministry of Water Resources said that a total of 443 rivers nationwide have been flooded, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded. According to statistics from the National Cultural Heritage Administration (NCHA), 76 key national cultural relics and 187 provincial cultural heritage sites have suffered damage of varying degrees.Affected regions include Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, and Chongqing. The regions include the upper and middle river basin of the Yangtze and its tributaries. With more rain, floods started to extend to lower regions of the Yangtze basin such as Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. Hunan, Fujian, and Yunnan were also affected.


== Causes of floods ==


=== Natural causes ===
Hu Xiao from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) indicated that the rains were caused by increased vapors arising from the Indian and Pacific oceans.
Some experts claim climate change is partly to blame and such events may become more frequent in the future.


=== Artificial causes ===
The local governments in recent years had made steps to implement nature-based flood mitigation strategies like tree planting, sponge cities and floodplain restoration. Experts have noted these measures did have some positive effect as the intensity of precipitation in 2020 is much higher than the rains that caused the 1998 floods, yet the flooding has been less serious and damaging. However, huge challenges in flood management and resilience remain. The Yangtze flows through some of the most productive agricultural, economic and industrial centers in China. With the rapid increase of population in China and breakneck economic growth, a large number of lakes and other wetlands had been reclaimed into farmland or urban development. The serious shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is an important reason for the aggravation of flood disasters.
In 1915, Dongting Lake was 5,000-square-kilometre (1,900 sq mi). In 2000, it was only 2,625-square-kilometre (1,014 sq mi). In the 1950s, Poyang Lake was 4,350-square-kilometre (1,680 sq mi). In 2000, it was only 3,750-square-kilometre (1,450 sq mi). Hubei was once known as "The Province of a thousand of Lakes" (千湖之省). In the late 1950s, there were 1,066 lakes in Hubei. By the early 1980s, only 309 were left.


== Three Gorges Dam ==

Multiple dams in the Yangtze river basin control floodwaters; the biggest and most important of these is the Three Gorges Dam with its catchment area of about 1,000,000-square-kilometre (390,000 sq mi). It was constructed not only for power generation but also for flood control. By the end of June, the dam had started to release floodwaters. While the CMA indicated flood discharge started on 29 June, satellite images suggest that floodgates were opened already five days earlier. Yichang, a city below the dam, experienced extensive flooding, raising questions about the effectiveness of the flood control by the dam. According to the company that manages the dam, the dam had been "effectively reducing the speed and extent of water level rises on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze". Critics, however, suggest that the dam is "not doing what it is designed for" and unable to deal with severe events. Other experts have pointed out that studies do show that the dam does help alleviate typical flooding during normal years and that the problem is not the design of the dam, but the public's expectation that the dam alone can solve all the problems of flooding on the Yangtze. Particularly, when significant amounts of rainfall occurred downstream of the Three Gorges Dam in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze which will never pass through the dam. During July, three flood waves from rains in the upper Yangtze basin arrived at the dam, necessitating the opening of sluice gates multiple times to create space in the reservoir. In Chinese social media it was claimed that this exacerbated downstream flooding, while the dam operators maintained that the action helped to delay floodwaters going downstream. On August 15, "Flood #4" passed through the Three Gorges reservoir with a maximum inflow of 62,000 cubic meters per second, the highest reached at that time during this flood season. "Flood #5" passed the dam by August 22 when the reservoir's water level reached 167.85 meters, the highest level ever recorded.According to a member of the expert committee of the state-sanctioned National Disaster Reduction Centre,  the restrictions in human flow during the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China halted regular dam maintenance, dam inspection, training of officials and the construction of hydraulic projects, which were scheduled in the winter and spring of 2020. In response to concerns about the stability of the dam, the state-run Global Times tabloid claimed that the Three Gorges Dam was "safe for heavy rainfall" and "not at risk of collapse", and that some media organizations outside of mainland China made a disproportionate issue out of a distortion of the dam.
