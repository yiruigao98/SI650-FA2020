The Surabaya metropolitan area, known locally as Gerbangkertosusila (an acronym of Gresik–Bangkalan–Mojokerto–Surabaya–Sidoarjo–Lamongan), is a metropolitan area in East Java, Indonesia. It is the country's second-largest metropolitan area, after Jakarta metropolitan area.


== Definition ==

Grebangkertosusila is an official acronym of "Gresik Bangkalan Mojokerto Surabaya Sidoarjo Lamongan", a main metropolitan or planning area in East Java consisting of the seven cities and regencies with those names (Mojokerto is both a city and a regency). It has an area of 5,925.843 km2, and at the 2015 Census had a population of 9,563,572.
The national government regards the Surabaya Metropolitan Area as including only Surabaya, Sidoarjo Regency, and Gresik Regency, known as "Zona Surabaya Raya".  Gresik Regency includes Bawean Island, covering some 196 km2 and lying north of Java; however Bawean Island is excluded from the Metropolitan Area.  
Surabaya traditionally constituted Indonesia's second-largest metropolitan area, after Jakarta, but fast growing Bandung Metropolitan Area (in West Java) is since 2005 more populous.  However, the extended metropolitan area of Surabaya is second in Indonesia only to Jabodetabek.

Note: (a) The island of Bawean, while part of Gresik Regency, is not technically part of the Metropolitan area; nevertheless for convenience the figures given here include Bawean.
