== History ==


=== Early history ===
In the 1570s,  Captain Juan de Salcedo first explored what was the province of Tayabas. The Franciscan priests Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa between 1580 and 1583 founded its town, also named Tayabas. Tayabas was organized by the Spaniards through the Franciscan missionaries and Lucena was just one of its barrios.
The Spaniards of the 16th century called the area "Buenavista" because of its scenic beauty; several years later, the barrio was renamed "Oroquieta". A century later, Muslim pirates began terrorizing the entire Philippine coastline, and Oroquieta was not spared from the notorious raids. The barrio folks built forts along the seashores to defend it against the attacking pirates along the coast, particularly in the present-day Cotta and in Barangay Mayao, though these structures are no longer extant. Hence, the place became known as Cotta, the Spanish form of the Tagalog "kuta" ("fort"). The growth of local maritime trade facilitated in the Cotta port and the final defeat of Moro pirates plying the Luzon and Visayan waters, afforded the growth of Lucena as a town which eventually led to its being the capital of Tayabas, Quezon province in 1901.
Finally on November 5, 1879, the Orden Superior Civil officially adopted the name "Lucena" in honor of a Spanish friar by the name of Father Mariano Granja in Andalucia, Spain. Fr. Granja was responsible for the development of the barrio that became a Parish in 1881. Lucena became an independent municipality on June 1, 1882.
During the 1896 Philippine Revolution, the people of Lucena showed their brand of patriotism. José Zaballero led the local revolutionists who were under the barrage of Spanish muskets. Later, Miguel Arguilles with Jose Barcelona as President formed a revolutionary government in Lucena.
After Aguinaldo proclaimed the nation's independence on June 12, 1898, in Kawit, Cavite, Gen. Miguel Malvar, as Commanding General for Southern Luzon, took over Tayabas Province on August 15, 1898. Don Crisanto Marquez became Lucena's first elected Municipal president during the first Philippine Republic.


=== Modern history ===
Lucena's fertile soil became soaked with the blood of many Filipinos and Americans at the outbreak of the Filipino-American War in 1899. The foreigners established a civil government in the country, and on March 12, 1901, the provincial capital was transferred from Tayabas to Lucena.
During the Second World War, the Japanese Imperial Force occupied Lucena on December 27, 1941, 19 days after they set foot on Philippine soil. But the underground resistance movement was so tenacious in Lucena that by January 25, 1945 (even before the Americans have returned), the Hunters ROTC guerrillas penetrated into the town and successfully drove out the Japanese. The rest of Quezon Province (new name of Tayabas Province) had to wait for the American Liberation forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops to hand freedom on April 4 of that same year.
On June 17, 1961, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3271, Lucena was made into a chartered city through the efforts of then Congressman Manuel S. Enverga. It was officially inaugurated on August 19, 1962, during the 84th anniversary of Manuel L. Quezon. On July 1, 1991, Lucena became a highly urbanized city, thereby making the city independent from the province.
In May 2014, the Lucena City Public Market was razed by fire while festivities were being held for the culmination of Pasayahan sa Lucena a few blocks away. The whole block of the public market building was burned down. Through the cooperation of firefighters from Sariaya, Tayabas, Pagbilao and Lucena. In October 2016, a new state of the art Public Market building was opened to the public. The 2-storey building, which reportedly cost 99 million pesos to build, was financed through loans. According to the article, the Lucena Public Market was also burned down in 1965 along with huge parts of the city.In October 2019, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) completed the construction of a P245-million underpass along the Pan-Philippine Highway or the Manila South Road (MSR) Diversion Road in Brgy. Gulang-gulang, Lucena City, Quezon. The project was initially funded in the 2017 national budget at around ₱100 million. The remaining half was funded through the 2018 national budget. According to DPWH Secretary Mark Villar, the 472-meter long underpass with a 16 lineal-meter concrete bridge at the Lucena-Tayabas-Mauban Port Road aims to reduce the traffic congestion around the Daang Maharlika Route. This new underpass would directly shorten the travel time of those traversing Quezon Province such as those coming from Manila going to the Bicol region and vice versa.In response to the ongoing pandemic in the country, together with Quezon Gov. Danilo Suarez, Lucena City Mayor Roderick Alcala and Dr. Gerardo Carmelo Salazar, head of Lucena United Doctors Hospital and Medical Center (LUDHMC) inaugurated the first bio-safety laboratory for COVID-19 patients. This was made to lessen the turn-around time of cases as each specimen were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa and took a longer time for the results to be known as it is the only reference laboratory for the whole Calabarzon region. It is the third laboratory in the region together with those in UPLB in Los Banos, Laguna and De La Salle University – Dasmariñas in Dasmarinas, Cavite. As to this Lucena City has been one of the few cities outside Metro Manila to move from GCQ to the more lenient MGCQ. Despite numerous challenges, the city had an overall proactive and effective way of handling the pandemic.

Its port on the coast along Tayabas Bay is home to several boat and ferry lines operating and serving the sea lanes between Lucena and the different points in the region and as far as the Visayas.
There exists a Lucena Airport (known locally as 'Landing') located 300 meters west of AMA College Lucena Campus but is no longer usable. Light aircraft can no longer make use of it as a road was built as an intersection during the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

Economic activities in Lucena are heavily concentrated in the poblacion (bayan) and other suburban barangays where the highly dense and constricted central business district (CBD) is home to a large cluster of different business enterprises. As population grows in tandem with new and promising business prospects, business activities spill over adjoining barangays, thus forming mini satellite commercial areas.
Other commercial strips are located in the poblacion and suburban barangays where both retail and wholesale trade, including other essential services, are being engaged in. SM City Lucena is the biggest mall in the city located in Ibabang Dupay, which is one of the first SM Malls in Luzon.

Almost 3% of this or 46.62 hectares cover the industrial section, located in different barangays of the city. These areas are home to significant industrial and manufacturing activities.
Industry in Lucena produces a sustainable amount of agro-industrial-based products, dried and smoked fish, distilled liquors, bamboo and rattan furniture, ornamental flowers/plants, vegetable as well as meat products.
Lucena is also known as the "Cocopalm City of the South".

=== Festivals ===

Pasayahan sa Lucena was conceptualized to showcase the natural and ecological interrelationship and independence between nature and man. It also promotes the ways of life inherent among the people of Lucena. All these find exquisites and appreciative expressions through a mammoth gathering of colors, outlandish costumes and symbolic floats reminiscent of Mardi Gras in Rio de Janeiro and New Orleans. Originally intended as three days of spirited merrymaking in the streets, the event has become a weeklong tourist attraction, culminating on May 30 in time for the celebration of the Feast of St. Ferdinand, the patron saint of Lucena.
Another feast highlighting the entire celebration is the Chami Festival that would feature Lucena's very own pansit delicacy. The traditional Chami Festival has a contest of who can cook the most delicious chami. The contestants line up along Quezon Avenue, the city's main road, armed with their cooking utensils and will be provided free chami noodles, meat and other condiments for the cooking fest. All participants were also given cash incentive, gift packs from various sponsors. After the cooking, the spectators were given a chance to eat for free the different taste of chami. They wanted that through this chami cooking festival this city will become a destination of our local and foreign tourists every merry month of May.
