== History ==


=== Nineteenth-century industrialisation ===
Outcomes of the Franco-Prussian War included the annexation in 1871 of Alsace by Germany. A period of rapid modernisation ensued throughout the Strasbourg region, involving population growth, urbanisation and industrial expansion.
For Lingolsheim, a defining feature of this modernisation was the creation and rapid development of a large industrial tannery by Adler & Oppenheimer Aktiengesellschaft.   By 1914 the business employed 2,000 and leather dominated the town's economy.
These years also saw the establishment of a major sand extraction industry.   The local soil, rich in red and white sands, was intensively exploited during the closing years of the nineteenth century.


=== Twentieth century wars ===
Lingolsheim was not much affected by the fighting in the First World War, but following the defeat of Germany the whole of Alsace found itself transferred back to France.
The Second World War was more damaging.   Immediately before the German invasion of 1940, the town's tanneries were evacuated to Rennes where they remained until after the war.   In the autumn of 1940 Lingolsheim was incorporated into "Großstraßburg".   The buildings that had housed the tanneries were converted into a large workshop dedicated to repairing tanks.   During this war Lingolsheim was subjected to several bombardments.
