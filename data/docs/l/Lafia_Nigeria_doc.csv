== History ==
Lafia, also known as Lafian Beri-Beri, is the capital city of Nasarawa State, central Nigeria. Founded by Muhammadu Dunama in late 17th century on the site of a Koro (Migili) village. The indigenous Koro migrated southwards to Agyaragu, Anise etc. The town now has its 17th Emir in the person of Hon. Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad I JSC rtd. Lafia became the capital of a prominent local chiefdom in the late 19th century. During the rule of Mohamman Agwai (1881â€“1903), the Lafia market became one of the most important in the Benue Valley, and a trade route was opened to Loko (56 mi [90 km] southwest), a Benue River port. In 1903 the British, who controlled Northern Nigeria recognized Chief Musa as Lafia's first emir. The emirate formed the major part of the Lafia Division of Benue province. In 1967 the town became part of Benue-Plateau state, and in 1976 it was allocated to Plateau state.
Lafia is populated mainly by the Eggon, Alago, Kanuri, Aho and Koro. It also has large populations of Igbo, Hausa, Mwaghavul settlers amongst other tribes. This is due to the hospitable nature of the indigenes and has made the city a miniature Nigeria.
Modern Lafia aside from being an administrative and educational center, it is also a collecting point for sesame seeds, soybeans, and is a trading centre for yams, sorghum, millet, and cotton. Besides farming, cotton weaving and dyeing are traditionally important activities of the town's inhabitants. Livestock farming is also a prominent activity especially amongst the Fulani herdsmen.
The two royal families of Ari and Dallah Dunama of the Kanuri people (Beri-Beri, Kambari) are the ruling houses of the Lafia Emirate. The current Emir is Sidi Bage, from the Dallah Dunama royal family. He succeeded the longest reigning Emir,late HRH Isa Mustapha Agwai I. (1976 - 2019).
