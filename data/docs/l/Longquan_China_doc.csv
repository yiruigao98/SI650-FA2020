Longquan (simplified Chinese: 龙泉; traditional Chinese: 龍泉; pinyin: Lóngquán; lit.: 'dragon spring') is a county-level city and former county under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Lishui in southwestern Zhejiang Province, China, located on the upper reaches of the Ou River and bordering Fujian province to the southwest.
Called Longyuan (龙渊) before the Tang dynasty, Longquan adopted its current name because of the naming taboo of Emperor Gaozu, the founder of Tang whose personal name was Li Yuan (李渊).

Longquan is famous locally for its swords and Longquan celadon ceramics, both of which are often regarded as historically the finest in China.  Longquan celadon was one of China's finest ceramics from the Song dynasty until it fell out of fashion in the Imperial court during the Ming dynasty.  Production continued but at lower quality.  The swords made in Longquan (Longquanjian) are famous among martial artists in China.
