Licheng (simplified Chinese: 鲤城区; traditional Chinese: 鯉城區; pinyin: Lǐchéng Qū; Min Nan: Lí-siâⁿ-khu) is a district of Quanzhou, Fujian province, People's Republic of China.


== Geography ==
Licheng District consists of two parts, separated by the Jin River. On the left, northeastern side of the river, Licheng District includes several square kilometers that encompass most of Quanzhou's historical center; this is surrounded on all sides (other than the river) by Fengze District. On the right, southeastern side, Licheng District includes a much larger area, with both urban and suburban parts.


== Architecture ==
In relation to many other cities in China, Licheng has much of its historic center intact. Lichengs historic center is not the typical Chinese city center, having many European influenced buildings and churches as well. Considering that it is a coastal port city this is unsurprising however.
