== History ==
It was founded in 1702 on the spot of the village of Mokrishvitsa, where Peter the Great had established the Olonets Shipyard. In 1703, the first ship of the Baltic Fleet was built here—a 28-cannon frigate called Shtandart. In 1704, six more frigates, four shnyavas, four galleys, and twenty-four semi-galleys were constructed, which would form the first Russian squadron in the Baltic Sea. Over four hundred sailboats and rowboats were built throughout the shipyard's existence.
In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Lodeynoye Pole was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known from 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, it was transferred to the newly established Novgorod Governorate, and in 1776, it was further transferred into newly established Olonets Oblast. In 1781, Olonets Oblast was transferred to St. Petersburg Governorate, and in 1784, it was transformed into an independent administrative unit, Olonets Viceroyalty. In 1785, Lodeynoye Pole was granted an uyezd town status.

In 1799, Olonets Viceroyalty was abolished and divided between Novgorod and Arkhangelsk Governorates. Lodeynopolsky Uyezd was merged into Olonetsky Uyezd. In 1801, Olonets Governorate was established, and in 1802, Lodeynopolsky Uyezd was restored. In 1922, Olonets Governorate was abolished and Lodeynopolsky Uyezd was transferred to Petrograd Governorate (later Leningrad Oblast).On August 1, 1927, the uyezds in Leningrad Oblast were abolished and Lodeynopolsky District, with the administrative center in Lodeynoye Pole, was established. It was a part of Lodeynoye Pole Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. In 1931, the infamous Soviet concentration camp Svirlag was established, with the headquarters in the former Alexander-Svirsky Monastery, several kilometers from Lodeynoye Pole. Thousands of  victims (to a great extent Russian Orthodox clergy) lost there their lives. During World War II, Lodeynoye Pole was at the frontline but was not occupied by Finnish troops which kept the areas north of the Svir.
