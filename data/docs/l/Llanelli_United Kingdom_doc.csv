Llanelli ("St Elli's Parish"; Welsh pronunciation: [ɬaˈnɛɬi]) is the largest town in Carmarthenshire, the "Garden of Wales",  and in the preserved county of Dyfed, Wales. Located on the Loughor estuary 10.5 miles (16.9 km) north-west of Swansea and 12 miles (19 km) south-east of the county town, Carmarthen, it was a market town that became industrialised in the early 19th century as the global centre for tinplate production. Several communities nearby may be included colloquially in Llanelli. The community of Llanelli had a population of 25,168 in 2011. The local authority had previously been the Llanelli Borough Council when the preserved county of Dyfed was in existence, however it is now under Carmarthenshire County Council local authority.


== Name ==


=== 'Llanelli' or 'Llanelly' ===
The spelling 'Llanelly' is an anglicised form which was used until 1966, after which it was changed after a local public campaign. This is evident in the name of the local historic building, 'Llanelly House'. It can also lead to confusion with the village and parish, Llanelly, which is in south-east Wales near Abergavenny.
Llanelly in Victoria, Australia was named after the town of Llanelli (or Llanelly as it was known as in the 19th century).


== Location ==
The town lies on the River Lliedi, on the north coast of the Loughor Estuary inlet, which opens out into Carmarthen Bay, and the Bristol Channel. Llanelli is within the western Welsh county of Carmarthenshire, and is situated to the north-west of the city of Swansea and to the south-east of the county town of Carmarthen.


== History ==

The first beginnings of Llanelli can be found on the lands of present-day Parc Howard. An Iron Age hill fort once stood which was called Bryn-Caerau (hill of the forts). Evidence suggests that there were many as 5 hill forts from Old Road to the Dimpath.
During the early medieval period, it is said a saint named Elli, or Ellyw, who in legend is the son or daughter (gender not known) of King Brychan, established a church on the banks of the Afon Lliedi. Originally, the church would have been a wooden or partly stone thatched structure, and it wasn't until the 1200s that the stone church, of which the original tower stand to this day, was constructed. The current church (excluding the tower) was rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century. With the establishment of the church during the early medieval period, a small market town grew. However, the town remained a relatively small place in comparison to the town of Carmarthen and Kidwelly, both of which are located in Carmarthenshire, until the industrialisation of Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, when it grew significantly.  
Llanelli became such a significant regional producer of tin, and it was referred to as "Tinopolis" by the latter half of the 19th century for this reason. Lying near the Western fringe of the South Wales Coal Field, Llanelli played an important role in British industry, with three small docks being established within the town, to export coal along with the copper and tin, which was being produced within the town itself. Although Llanelli is not located within the South Wales valleys, coal from the Gwendraeth and the Loughor Valleys were transported to Llanelli where it would be exported globally. The Stepney Family, along with other prominant families (including the Raby family, Howard family and Cowell family), played an important role in the development of the town. 
Aside from industry, Llanelli is also renowned for its pottery, with its unique cockerel hand painted upon each item. A collection of this pottery is located at the Llanelli Museum, in Parc Howard. People from Llanelli are sometimes nicknamed "Turks". The origin of this name is uncertain. One theory is that many Turkish sailors once called at the port of Llanelli during their voyages.


== Culture and language ==


=== National Eisteddfod ===
Llanelli has hosted the National Eisteddfod six times: in 1895, 1903, 1930, 1962, 2000 and 2014.


=== Welsh language ===
In the mid-20th century, Llanelli was the largest town in the world where more than half the population spoke a Celtic language. It is ranked the 7th largest urban area in Wales. According to the 2011 UK Census returns, 23.7 per cent of Llanelli town residents habitually spoke Welsh. However, the area around Llanelli is a Welsh stronghold where 56 per cent do so in communities such as Llwynhendy and Burry Port.
During the 1950s, Trefor and Eileen Beasley campaigned to get Llanelli Rural Council to distribute tax papers in Welsh by refusing to pay taxes until their demand was met. The council reacted by sending in the bailiffs and selling their furniture to recover the money owed. The Beasleys' neighbours bought the furniture and returned it to them. The council finally reversed this policy in the 1960s, when it accepted that Welsh should have equal status with English language.


== Economy ==
In 1991 Llanelli was a distinct Travel to Work Area, but the 2001-based revision has merged the locality into a wider Swansea Bay Travel to Work Area.


=== Manufacture ===
A number of manufacturing companies (including the Tata Steel Europe tinplate works at Trostre, and Dyfed Steels), many of which service the automotive industry, are in the area around Llanelli. The Technium Performance Engineering Centre was developed at Llanelli Gate as a business incubator for businesses in the automotive, motor sport and aerospace sectors.The traditional industries of Llanelli have been in gradual decline over recent decades and local government has responded by promoting developments such as the Machynys Golf Course, new retail parks at Trostre and Pemberton, and the Millennium Coastal Park, to help attract tourism. The core shopping area has now largely relocated from the town centre to the Trostre/Pemberton area.


=== Brewing ===
Llanelli has a brewing tradition, with the Felinfoel Brewery in Felinfoel, located just outside the town.The Reverend James Buckley was an ordained Methodist minister, born in Oldham, Lancashire in 1770. After moving to Llanelli towards the end of the 18th century, he became involved in the establishment of a small brewery in the town. After the death of the owner, the Rev. Buckley came into the possession of the brewery and changed its name to Buckley's Brewery. In 1998, the brewery was purchased by Brains Brewery, and production was transferred to their brewery in Cardiff. However, Brains continue to produce The Reverend James, a bitter named in memory of the Reverend. The brewery has now been partly demolished.


=== Leisure and tourism ===
Over the past decade, the emphasis on heavy industry that once played an important part in the district has changed to an emphasis on creating tertiary sector employment in leisure and tourism. Llanelli is now being developed as a leisure and tourism destination, with many ongoing developments such as the new Llanelli Scarlets rugby stadium, the Old Castle Works leisure village (see below) and a National Hunt racecourse at Ffos Las near Trimsaran. Machynys Ponds, a Site of Special Scientific Interest notable for its dragonfly population, is 1 mile (1.6 km) to the south of Llanelli.


== Religion ==


=== Nonconformism ===

From the early 19th to the late 20th century, Llanelli was a major centre of Welsh nonconformism and there were many notable chapels in the town. Several of these have now closed and others are in serious decline. Their history was chronicled in a volume by BBC journalist Huw Edwards.Of these chapels, several are significant, including Capel Als, where David Rees was a minister for many years in the 19th century. Llanelli was noted for its numerous Independent (Congregationalist) chapels, including, Tabernacle, Siloah and Soar.
The Tabernacle Chapel, built in 1872–1873, by John Humphreys of Morriston, is situated at corner of Town Hall Square, overlooking Town Hall. The site is bordered by Coleshill Terrace, Church Street and Coldstream Street. It is built of brown snecked rubble stone with extensive Bath stone dressings and a slate roof. A prominent feature is the four-pillared Corinthian arcade at the entrance. It was Grade II* listed in December 1992. It is used as a venue by the Llanelli Choral Society. Other listed chapels in Llanelli include Bethel Baptist Chapel in Copperworks Road, Park Congregational Chapel, at the junction between Murray Street and Inkerman Street, Zion Baptist Chapel at Island Place, and Hall Street Methodist Church.


=== Church in Wales ===

The parish church of St Elli has a medieval tower; the main body of the church was rebuilt by G. F. Bodley in 1905–1906. The church is a Grade II* listed building. Several other churches in the town are also listed buildings, but made redundant by the Church in Wales and now in private ownership. They include All Saints Church, and St Albans Church.


== Sport ==


=== Rugby union ===
The town's rugby union teams—the Scarlets regional side, competing in the Pro14, and Llanelli RFC, competing in the Principality Premiership—play at Parc y Scarlets, opened in November 2008 just outside town in Pemberton.
Previously, the two teams had played at Stradey Park, home to Llanelli RFC for over 130 years. It was one of the stadiums used during the 1999 Rugby World Cup, hosting the Argentina v Western Samoa game on 10 October. Stradey Park is now being re-developed.
The Welsh folk song Sosban Fach ("Little Saucepan") is mostly associated with Llanelli RFC. Many rugby clubs have notable scalps collected from touring international sides, but on 31 October 1972, Llanelli claimed perhaps the greatest by beating the New Zealand All Blacks. The Scarlets side emerged 9–3 winners at Stradey Park.
There is also a strong junior rugby core in Llanelli, including club sides such as Felinfoel, New Dock Stars, Llangenech and the Llanelli Wanderers. In 2005, Coedcae School won the Inter-Schools Cup of Wales with an 8–5 victory over Brynteg Comprehensive.

The house, located directly opposite the parish church, is currently in a poor state of repair, however the town council has recently purchased it with plans to completely restore the house for civic and public use. The house was built for Thomas Stepney, the Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire, in 1714. John Wesley, the early leader of the Methodist movement, stayed at the house several times. The house was also featured in the first series of the BBC television show, Restoration.

== Government ==
Llanelli is within the Llanelli parliamentary constituency, which is presently represented by the elected Labour party member Nia Griffith MP, and the National Assembly for Wales constituency, which is represented by Labour's Lee Waters AM. Llanelli is run on a community level by Llanelli Town Council and Llanelli Rural Council (depending on the area of town) and Carmarthenshire County Council on a local government level. Note that Llanelli Rural Council addresses some part of the town, but mainly the Llanelli Rural community. Llanelli's politics has been Labour-dominated for decades. It's geographical location has led to a sense of exceptionalism in relation to the rest of Carmarthenshire, which is dominated by Plaid Cymru. In reaction to this, there have been calls to reinstate the local government district of Llanelli either as a county or as the City of Llanelli, returning the entire area to a one party enclave.
The community of Llanelli is bordered by the communities of Llanelli Rural; Llanrhidian Higher; and Llanrhidian Lower, the latter two being in the City and County of Swansea.

=== Llanelli Waterside ===
Llanelli Waterside, a joint venture between Carmarthenshire County Council and the Welsh Assembly Government, is a project that aims to drive the regeneration of the Llanelli area by transforming the waterfront into a business, leisure and residential community. Currently, there are two seafront housing developments under construction. Pentre Nicklaus Village, located on the Machynys Peninsula has been the subject of recent criticism for being above the price range of local people. Pentre Doc Y Gogledd (North Dock Village) in the historic North Dock area is currently being developed by David McLean homes and is currently on the last phase of development.
