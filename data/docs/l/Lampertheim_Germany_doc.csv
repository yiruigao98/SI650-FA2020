Lampertheim is a town in the Bergstraße district in Hesse, Germany. In 1984, the town hosted the 24th Hessentag state festival.


== Geography ==


=== Location ===
Lampertheim lies in the southwest corner of Hesse in the Rhine rift at the Biedensand Conservation Area (an old arm of the Rhine) and borders on Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. It is on the right bank of the Rhine across from Worms (Rhineland-Palatinate), roughly 15 kilometres (9 miles) north of Mannheim (Baden-Württemberg). The town is broadly, but visibly surrounded by the Odenwald and the Palatinate Forest.


=== Neighbouring communities ===
Lampertheim is one of Hesse’s southernmost towns and borders on Bürstadt, Lorsch, Viernheim and Mannheim (Baden-Württemberg).


=== Constituent communities ===
Lampertheim has the outlying centres of Hofheim, Hüttenfeld, Neuschloß and Rosengarten, which are all Stadtteile. Furthermore, there are residential neighbourhoods named Heide, Oberlach-Rosenau, Am Küblinger Damm, Lache, An der Wormser Straße, In den Böllenruthen, In den Ruthen, Wehrzollhaus, Wildbahn and Seehof.


== History ==
The earliest forms of the town’s name handed down from 832 were Langobardonheim or Langbardheim, which led to the conclusion that the town was founded by the Lombards (Langobarden in German). There is however today no further doubt that Lampertheim arose at the time of Frankish settlement and that the name is to be taken as meaning “Lantberths’ Home”, the name “Lantberth” – also “Lampert” or “Lambert” – meaning “Land-brightening ones”. In 1716, the town was granted market rights, and on 4 August 1951 town rights.

=== Buildings ===

Worth mentioning is the Schloss Rennhof built by Baron Rothschild in 1853 and the old schoolhouse built in 1906 and 1907, both in Hüttenfeld. In the Schloss Rennhof is found the Litauisches Gymnasium Hüttenfeld (“Lithuanian Gymnasium”), originally established as a school for  Lithuanian émigrés’ children after their homeland was overrun by the Soviet Union in the Second World War. It is the only recognized Lithuanian school in Western Europe.
The many transmission masts of the shortwave broadcaster Radio Free Europe Lampertheim, one of the biggest shortwave transmission facilities in Germany, are up to 125 m tall.
