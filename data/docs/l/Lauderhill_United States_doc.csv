== Etymology ==
The development that eventually came to be known as Lauderhill was originally to be named "Sunnydale", but William Safire, a friend of the developer, Herbert Sadkin, convinced him to change his mind. Safire felt that "Sunnydale" sounded like a neighborhood in Brooklyn. Sadkin said there were no hills in the new town, to which Safire replied, "There are probably no dales in Lauderdale, either!"  From that discussion, the name "Lauderhill" was coined. The development eventually grew to become Lauderhill, the city.


== History ==

Lauderhill was one of two developments (the other in New York) that began largely as off-the-shelf architectural designs which had been available to the public at Macy's department store. The homes, which had been designed by Andrew Geller, had originally been on display at the "Typical American Houses" at the American Exhibition in Moscow. Following a group of approximately 200 of the homes constructed in Montauk, New York in 1963 and 1964, the same developer, Herbert Sadkin of the New York-based All-State Properties reprised his success in New York, building a series of similar homes in Florida, calling the development Lauderhill.
In 2003, the New York Times described the Macy's homes:

The package deal included a 730- to 1,200-square-foot house on a 75-by-100-foot lot, as well as state-of-the art appliances, furniture, housewares and everything else a family would need for a weekend in the sun, including toothbrushes and toilet paper. The cost was roughly $13,000 to $17,000.
The Inverrary Country Club was built in 1970, and two years later, its East golf course became home to the new Jackie Gleason Inverrary Classic on the PGA Tour, which it hosted through 1983.  Gleason himself built his final home on the golf course.
Up until the late 1980s-early 1990s, Lauderhill was mostly a retirement community for Jews and a second home for snowbirds (especially in the Inverrary neighborhood). It is now home to mostly Jamaicans, West Indians, and African Americans, but it still has a sizeable white, Jewish, and Hispanic population in the Northwest section and in the Inverrary neighborhood, located north of Oakland Park Boulevard and east of University Drive).
