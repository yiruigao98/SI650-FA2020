Levallois-Perret (IPA: [lə.va.lwa.pɛ.ʁɛ]) is a commune in the Hauts-de-Seine department and Île-de-France region of north-central France. It lies some 6 km from the centre of Paris in the north-western suburbs of the French capital. It is the most densely populated town in Europe and, together with neighbouring Neuilly-sur-Seine, one of the most expensive suburbs of Paris.


== Name ==
The name Levallois-Perret comes from two housing developments, Champerret (started by landowner Jean-Jacques Perret in 1822) and Village Levallois (founded by developer Nicolas-Eugène Levallois in 1845), which resulted in the incorporation of the commune.


== History ==
On the territory of what is now Levallois-Perret, before the French Revolution, stood the village of Villiers and the hamlet of Courcelles (or La Planchette). They now give their names to two Paris Métro stations. At the time of the creation of French communes during the French Revolution, they were part of the commune of Clichy, and the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine extended over what is now the south-western part of Levallois-Perret.
Landowner Jean-Jacques Perret initiated a number of housing developments in 1822 in the northeast of the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine, in a place which soon came to be known as Champerret ("champ Perret": "Perret field") and would later give its name to a station on the Paris Métro. Later in 1845, Nicolas-Eugène Levallois began to develop housing on behalf of André Noël, who owned land near La Planchette (in the commune of Clichy). The land developed by Levallois soon became known as the Village Levallois.
In the 1860s, the village had grown to the point of forming a single built-up area and several requests were made to the authorities for the area to be incorporated as a commune.

Eventually the requests were acceded to and on 30 June 1866 the commune of Levallois-Perret was eventually created by detaching that part of the territory of Clichy on which stood the Village Levallois stood and merging it with that part of Neuilly-sur-Seine occupied by Champerret.
The Eiffel company had its factory in the commune, and it was therefore in Levallois-Perret that the structure of the both the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower were built.Levallois-Perret became an important centre of the early French automotive industry with the establishment there of such companies as Clément-Bayard, Delage, and the coachbuilders Chapron and Faget & Varnet. Citroën purchased the Clément-Bayard factory and produced the famous Citroën 2CV there for nearly forty years. Levallois-Perret was also an important centre of the cosmetics industry in the early 20th century. It is also home to the large European commercial real estate company Atisreal and to the conglomerate Alstom.
The northern part of the famous Île de la Jatte in the river Seine, is where French impressionist painters created many of their masterpieces.
Patrick Balkany has been the mayor of Levallois-Perret for more than 18 consecutive years. He was also mayor during the period 1983–95. His wife, Isabelle Balkany Smadja, works for the municipality.
