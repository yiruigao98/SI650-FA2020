The ancient name of the city was Bergula; Emperor Theodosius I changed it to Arcadiopolis (Greek: Αρκαδιούπολις) in honour of his son and successor Arcadius.
The city of Arcadiopolis fell to Attila the Hun during his campaign against the Eastern Roman Empire in 443 AD.
The Battle of Arcadiopolis (970) saw Byzantine forces defeat an invading Kievan-Pecheneg-Magyar force who were aiming to capture Constantinople, 100 miles (161 kilometres) to the east.
The Battle of Lule Burgas (1912) was here in the First Balkan War.
As the capital of the Roman province of Europa it had its own bishop, who was noted to a number of important church councils and was noted as an autocephalous archbishopric by the seventh century.  It is no longer a residential bishopric, although the Diocese of Arcadiopolis survives as a Roman Catholic titular see.
