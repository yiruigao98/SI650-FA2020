Plaisir (French pronunciation: ​[plɛziʁ]) is a commune located in the heart of the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France in north-central France. It is located in the western suburbs of Paris, 29.5 km (18.3 mi) from the center of Paris.
It borders among others on Élancourt (south), Trappes (southeast) and Les-Clayes-sous-Bois (east).

Plaisir is the ninth commune of the Yvelines department in terms of population., with nearly 31,000 inhabitants.
It is a member of the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.
Between 1968 and 1990, Plaisir has seen explosive growth in its population, but since then, the town's policy has been to contain growth and aim for stabilisation, in order to main the local quality of living as well as the natural spaces (forests and agricultural lands).
It has a major shopping mall that is still expanding. This commercial activity has been a boon for local tax revenues, but also led to congestion of its roads.
