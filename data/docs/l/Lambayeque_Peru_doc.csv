Lambayeque is a city in the Lambayeque region of northern Peru. It is notable for its exceptional museums featuring artifacts from local prehistoric archaeological sites.


== Geography ==
The vast plains of Túcume are part of the Lambayeque Valley, the largest valley of the north coast of Peru. The Lambayeque Valley is the site of natural and man-made waterways and is also a region of about 250 decaying and heavily eroded mud-brick pyramids.


== Archaeology ==
The Brüning Museum, established in the early 20th century, contains hundreds of gold and silver pieces, as well as textiles and ceramics, from the Vicus, Moche, Chimú, Lambeyeque and Inca cultures. The Tumba Real (Royal Tombs of Sipán Museum), established in 2002, contains artefacts from the Moche tombs of the Lord of Sipan, of which fourteen have been excavated.
Dating from around 2000 BCE, the Ventarron temple is one of the oldest found in the Americas, as reported by the Peruvian archeologist Walter Alva.


== Culture ==
Lambayeque is also the home of King Kong milk candy, a popular dessert with filling made of fresh milk, pineapple sweets and sometimes peanut. The region is also known for alfajores.
