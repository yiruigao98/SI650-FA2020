Las Anod (Somali: Laascaanood; Arabic: لاس عانود‎) is the administrative capital of the Sool region of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, an entity that is recognized as part of Somalia.


== History ==

During the pre-independence period, Las Anod served as an early center for Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's Dervish resistance.

On October 15, 1969, while paying a visit to the city, Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on October 21, 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army. Large protests have also been staged in the city against visiting delegations from Somaliland. Additionally, the Khaatumo authorities have condemned the occupation and demanded that Somaliland withdraw its troops.


== Territorial dispute ==

The city is disputed by Puntland and Somaliland. The former bases its claim due to the kinship ties between the Dhulbahante clan and the dominant clan in Puntland, the Majerteen. Whilst the later's claim is grounded on the border of the former British Somaliland Protectorate.In 2018, there were clashes between Puntland and Somaliland in the town of Tukaraq in which the Puntland vowed to recapture Las Anod. The residents of the city demonstrated their loyalty to Puntland via widespread protests.
