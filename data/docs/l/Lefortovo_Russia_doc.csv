It is named after a close associate of Tsar Peter the Great, Franz Lefort, whose troops were stationed nearby at the German Quarter. Lefortovo is considered to have been founded in 1699. In the 18th century, it was home to Annenhof, Lefortovo Palace, Sloboda Palace, and Catherine Palace. In later centuries, the district hosted troops and military organizations, and also became heavily industrialized.
The present-day Lefortovo is famous for the Lefortovo Prison, Lefortovo park and the Lefortovo Tunnel on the Third Ring. Several higher educational institutions are located in Lefortovo, such as the Moscow Power Engineering Institute.
