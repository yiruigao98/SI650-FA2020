Landerneau (French pronunciation: ​[lɑ̃dɛʁno]; Breton: Landerne, pronounced [lãnˈdɛrne]) is a commune in the Finistère department of Brittany in north-western France.
It lies at the mouth of the Elorn River which divides the Breton provinces of Cornouaille and Léon, 22 km (14 mi) east of Brest.  The name is from Lan Terneo and can mean "(religious) enclosure of St Ténénan (Welsh: Tyrnog)": allegedly a Welshman who also had llans in the Vale of Clwyd in North Wales and in Somerset, and who moved to Brittany in the 7th century. Lann means a religious sacred place. The town has been founded by Saint Arnoc, some times called Ternoc and confusion can occur with Saint Ténénan. Some sources point Saint Arnoc and Saint Ténénan as the same person.
It was an important centre of the flax and linen industries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Landerneau is also the hometown of Édouard Leclerc, a businessman and entrepreneur who founded the French supermarket chain E.Leclerc in 1948. His first store applies a hard competition with other supermarket chains with local made products and lower prices. Leclerc's new methods of sales are still applied in all supermarkets and hypermarkets and marks an evolution in the market's history. The town is actually the heart of the agricultural market in northwest Brittany with several agribusiness companies headquarters located in the town.
A picturesque feature of the town centre is the sixteenth-century house-lined bridge (the Pont de Rohan) across the Elorn. The Pont de Rohan was the most downstream crossing of the Elorn River until 1930 and the construction of the Pont Albert Louppe near Brest.
The town is also known for its moon, La Lune de Landerneau (the Moon of Landerneau). This nickname is supposed from a noble visiting Versailles court and was not impressed by the luxury of the Château de Versailles. He was contemplating the moon with others in the Versailles gardens when he said "the Landerneau's moon is bigger", that made the assembly laugh. The Breton noble made reference to a big silver metal disc on top of the Saint Houardon Church, well known in the surroundings as "the moon of Landerneau".


== International relations ==

== Music festival ==
Each year in August a music festival called "Fête du bruit dans Landerneau" takes place in Landerneau. "Fête du bruit dans Landerneau" means "festival of noise in Landerneau". When spoken it sounds identical to "faites du bruit dans Landerneau" which means "make some noise in Landerneau". This is a play on words based on the homophones "fête" and "faites". It also a play on words based on a French expression "Cela va faire du bruit dans Landerneau" meaning "That gonna make some noise in Landerneau". The origins of the expression is not clear. The first theory is from a 1796 theater drama, "Alexandre Duval's Les Heritiers", after a famous sailor declared dead is back to his hometown, Landerneau. "His death will make some noise in Landerneau" text said. The second theory is from the "Bagne de Brest" (Brest's Prison between 1749 and 1848). When a prisoner escapes, the prison's cannons were fired to alarm the area of the evasion. The noise of the canons could be heard from Landeneau, 22 kilometers (14 miles) away.
