It is about 15 km (9.3 mi) southeast of Palma Airport, at the foot (about 4 km  southwest) of Puig de Randa mountain on the road from Palma to Santanyí. Since the town is also about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the coast, it is not especially geared towards tourists.


=== History ===
The first church in Llucmajor was erected in 1259. In 1300 it was elevated to "villa" by James II of Majorca. The most important historical event in connection with the town is the Battle of Llucmajor, where in 1349 Peter IV of Aragon defeated his cousin James III of Majorca, resulting in the end of the independent Kingdom of Majorca. James was killed on the battlefield northeast of the town. He was first buried in the parish church of the town. Today his grave is located in the cathedral of Palma.
In 1543 Charles V granted the city the right to hold a market on Wednesdays and Fridays.
In the 20th century Llucmajor developed into an industrial centre (especially for shoemaking), and so achieved a degree of prosperity.
