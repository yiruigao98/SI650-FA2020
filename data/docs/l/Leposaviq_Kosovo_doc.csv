The Sočanica Monastery was founded in the 13th century by King Stefan Milutin.

=== Yugoslavia (1918–92) ===
After the First Balkan War (1912), Kosovo was internationally recognised as a part of Serbia and northern Metohija as a part of Montenegro at the Treaty of London in May 1913. In 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later named Yugoslavia was established by the merging of the Western South Slavic states. Between 1929 and 1941, the region was administratively part of the Zeta Banovina.
Lešak, Belo Brdo, Vračevo, Berberište were incorporated into the Leposavić municipality in 1953.In the mid–1950s, the Assembly of PR Serbia decided that the Leposavić municipality be ceded to Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija, after requests by the Kosovo leadership. It had up until then been part of the Kraljevo srez, of which the population was wholly Serb. After this, the number of Serbs drastically fell. In 1959, Leposavić was incorporated into the province.


=== Modern ===
After the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the political group Pokret za Leposavić ("Movement for Leposavić") was established, which sought to bring together those committed to cooperation and communication with the international community and the Albanians.The municipality assembly joined the Association of Serb Municipalities and Settlements of Kosovo and Metohija in 2003, which exercised legislative and executive authority over North Kosovo and other Serb enclaves.
