== Library ==
Lynn Haven Public Library, Bay County’s first library, was established in the city of Lynn Haven in 1911 when a group of fourteen ladies donated a book and three magazines . Without a true library, they met in various homes and other local buildings as the Lynn Haven Literary Club . By 1915, the collection grew to 500 volumes. In 1922, the McMullin family donated a building and $1,000 and library became known as the Mcmullen Library . The Literary Club began a weekly story-telling hour on Saturdays for children under the age of twelve . 
In 1925, the Literary Club joined the Federation of Women’s Club, continuing their sponsorship of the McMullin Library. The Lynn Haven Women’s Club provided building maintenance and expense, made several improvements, and purchased many books . 
In 1961, the McMullin Library joined the Northwest Regional Library System. During this time, the city was flourishing and required a larger, more modern building. The library moved to a new location, once again. In 1970, the new North Bay Branch Library was founded. In the middle of the 1980s, the library underwent a major expansion to improve service and create room for over 11,000 volumes . A fund drive was held, along with funds matched by a grant from the State of Florida allowed for the building addition. The grand opening happened at the end of 1988 .
In 1990, the City of Lynn Haven took charge of the library’s financial responsibilities and the name was changed to the Lynn Haven Public Library .
