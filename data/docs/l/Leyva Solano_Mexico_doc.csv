The first outline of the city was made by the architect Luis F. Molina.


== Etymology ==
The genuine Aztec name of the Nahuatl language is Colhuacán or Culhuacán, which is from colhua or culhua and can, which is a place, and its meaning varies according to different historians:

"snake place"
"crooked hill"
"where walkers twist the path"The most respected theory is "place of the colhuas", that is "inhabited by the colhua tribe", and the most frequent meaning is "place of worshiping the God Coltzin".


== History ==


=== Prehispanic era ===
In ancient times, there was an indigenous population called Huey Colhuacan that dates back to Tecpatl, which corresponds to the year 628 of our era; the Aztecs built it during their pilgrimage. Its exact location is unknown, but it is assumed that it was close to the current town of Culiacancito. Here he was born in 1065 A.D. the cult of Huitzilopochtli, the warrior god of Aztec mythology. The ancient settlers were called Culichis.


=== Virreinal time ===
The city that we know today as Culiacán was co-founded in 1531 by Lázaro de Cebreros and Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán under the name of Villa de San Miguel. Upon their arrival in the 16th century, the Spanish found the existence of farmhouses organized in indigenous nations by the tribe of the Tahues, which brought together a group of people of the same origin and language who had a common tradition, their limits were the elements natural, like rivers, mountains, among others.
Other indigenous peoples that inhabited the original territory of Culiacán were the Tebacas, Pacaxes, Sabaibo and Achires.
After their war of conquest, Lázaro de Cebreros and Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán (1531), organized the territories acquired in three provinces, one of them was Culiacán which was delimited, to the south, by the Elota river and in the north by the Mocorito River, depending on the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia. Organized in this way, it lasted until 1786, the year in which the administration system was implemented, with Sonora and Sinaloa forming the administration of Arizpe and the ancient province of Culiacán gave life to the party of the same name with equal jurisdiction.


=== Independent Mexico ===
On October 6, 1821, Independence was sworn in Culiacán. Culiacán is granted the category of city, on July 21, 1823, when the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa separated by decree from Congress. In 1824, by Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation, Sinaloa and Sonora meet again, forming the state of the West. In 1830, the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa were definitively separated, by decree of October 13, 1830, the city of Culiacán being designated capital of the state of Sinaloa. Later, during the conservative government related to the French Intervention in 1861, prefectures were installed and the Municipalities Law was decreed that divided the Districts into City Councils. The Badiraguato District was suppressed and became part of the Culiacán District as a Municipality.
From 1859 to 1873 it ceased to be the capital of Sinaloa, which moved to Mazatlán. Already in the Restored Republic, Governor Eustaquio Buelna confronted the merchants of the port. He returned to Culiacán and the Local Congress gave him the status of capital of the state.


=== Porfirian and revolutionary times ===
For 1878, Culiacán had three City Halls, whose headwaters were Culiacán, Quilá and Badiraguato, it remained that way until in 1880 Badiraguato returned to being a district with the limits that previously corresponded to it.
1912 was the year in which the Municipalities were established by law as a new form of internal government, but it was until 1915 that the Political Directories were suppressed, this law coming into force, causing the Districts to become free municipalities.
Culiacán was established as a Municipality by decree published on April 8, 1915, comprising within its limits the current Municipality of Navolato that was segregated in 1982, according to a decree of August 27 of that year, thus losing 2,285 km² of the valley agricultural.

Some time later, the State Congress approved the extension of the name of the capital city, giving it its current official name, Culiacán de Rosales, in honor of the great Mexican military man, Antonio Rosales.


=== After World War II ===
Beginning in the late 1950s, Culiacán became the birthplace of an incipient underground economy based on illicit drugs exported to the United States.  The completion of the Pan-American Highway and the regional airport in the 1960s accelerated the expansion of a workable distribution infrastructure for the enterprising few families that would later come to dominate the international drug cartels along Mexico's Pacific Northwest.


== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms of the municipality and the city of Culiacán in Sinaloa, Mexico, has various elements that represent the history of the municipality yesterday and today.
Rolando Arjona Amábilis was the one who drew up the official coat of arms of the Municipality of Culiacán, which was made official, through municipal decree number 13 of May 26, 1960 and published in number 90 of the Official Newspaper of the State of Sinaloa on July 30, 1960.

Its shape is square with rounded corners, ending in a point. The entire "field" of the shield covered with a reddish color of earth, is occupied by a hieroglyph representing a hill with a human head on top, very inclined forward and which alludes to Coltzin, "the crooked god", an authentic figure of the Nahuatl mythology, which gave name to a Nahuatlaca-Colhua tribe and this, in turn, to the town of its residence, Colhuacán or Teocolhuacán.
Behind the hieroglyph to the right, there are symbols of water referring to rivers; On the same hieroglyph, in the central part and towards the left side, there is a cross followed by a path on which footprints can be observed, which end in a small construction, motifs that symbolize the missionaries of San Miguel de Culiacán left for the north and they are invoked as an obligatory tribute to the goodness and heroism of the missionaries.
On the carmine border, the word "Culiacán" can be read in its upper part and in its lower part the word "Colhuacán" which corresponds to the true name of the place in the Nahuatl language. In the upper part of the shield there is a hill with a germinating seed and on it, the figure of a golden sun that alludes both to the tropical climate of this region and to the fundamentally agricultural effort of its inhabitants.
