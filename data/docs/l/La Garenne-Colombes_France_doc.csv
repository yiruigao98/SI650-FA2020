La Garenne-Colombes is a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 9.6 km (6.0 mi) from Notre Dame de Paris which is the center of Paris. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe.


== Name ==
The city used to be part of the neighbouring city of Colombes. At this time, before 1910, it was called "La Garenne de Colombes", which means "Colombes' Garenne". "Garenne" is French for "warren", so the English for "La Garenne-Colombes" could be "Columbia's warren" or "Warren of Columbia" ; yet the official translation of the name of the city is just "La Garenne-Colombes".
The explanation for the city being called "warren" is that it really used to be a warren where people would hunt. But this dates back to the French Royalty, at the 18th century or so.


== Geography ==
La Garenne-Colombes is usually simply called "La Garenne", and nicknamed "petit Neuilly".


=== Surroundings ===
Four towns surround La Garenne-Colombes: Colombes (North), Bois-Colombes (East), Courbevoie (South) and Nanterre (West). The city is quite small compared with the other cities in the Hauts-de-Seine, it is more or less as small as the first arrondissement of Paris. Very close to La Garenne-Colombes are La Défense and the Île de la Jatte island (Bowl Island).


=== Transportation ===
La Garenne-Colombes is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail line: La Garenne-Colombes and Les Vallées (this last station is located at the border between the commune of La Garenne-Colombes and the commune of Bois-Colombes, with a postal address in La Garenne-Colombes). The train has been used there since 1837.
The two stations directly join Paris's most important urban station (Gare Saint-Lazare, Saint-Lazare station) in 10 minutes and the biggest university in Paris (Paris Ouest La Défense University, Western Paris University La Défense) in 2 minutes.
In 1935, five Tramway lines crossed La Garenne-Colombes.
Many RATP Bus lines also cross the city: lines 73, 161, 163, 164, 176, 178, 262, 272, 278, 358 and 378.
Two RATP Noctilien night Bus lines cross the city: N24 and N152.
In 2012, the line 2 of the Parisian Tramway  will cross La Garenne-Colombes, with two stations: Les Fauvelles (French for Wildcats) and Charlebourg. To join the center of the CBD, 2 to 4 minutes will be required by tramway.


== History ==
It was named in 1240 as "La Garenne dépendant de Colombes" ("La Garenne depending on Colombes"). After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, the estate was bought by Peter Urban Sartoris, a Genevois banker who had lived in London for many years. On his death in 1833 it was inherited by his 6 children, who urbanised it and named the rue Sartoris. They sold the last of their interests in 1865.
The commune of La Garenne-Colombes was created on 2 May 1910 by detaching its territory from the commune of Colombes.


== Demography ==
As the commune's territory is entirely built up, population can only grow if buildings are demolished and replaced by bigger buildings for more people (higher, less gardens). Thereby the population will grow certainly over the 30,000 after many reconstructions in the "Champs-Philippe" neighbourhood, with a density over 17,000 inhabitants per square kilometres (43,855 inhabitants per square miles).
According to statistics, La Garenne-Colombes is an average city of the Hauts-de-Seine department (Paris region), which is one of the richest places in Europe.


== Economy ==

The landscape looks like an American CBD (Central Business District). But this is in the suburbs of Paris, which do not look like the downtown Paris districts surrounding the Eiffel Tower or the Champs-Elysées. Paradoxically, the most advanced part of the city of Paris, geographically speaking, is on the outskirts of the city itself.
There used to be many workshops in La Garenne-Colombes, as in a large part of the Hauts-de-Seine department. Today, it is mainly a residential city. However, some 1200 business units are there.


=== Tertiary activity ===

The service industry is paramount in the economy of La Garenne-Colombes. The proximity of La Défense increases this phenomenon. There is :

Peugeot study offices
Boston Scientific International
RATP's Charlebourg centerThe arrival of the Tramway in 2012 resulted in a redevelopment of a part of the city, and should bring a new breath of life to the local economy.

=== The city ===

In spite of the proximity of La Défense and Paris which has applied a strong pressure, no big buildings were built in La Garenne. Residential buildings (detached homes and apartment buildings) account for the majority of the building stock in La Garenne-Colombes.  Many of these buildings were constructed in the early 1900s. In a large part of the town, new construction is limited to 4 floors.
