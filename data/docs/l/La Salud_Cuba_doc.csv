The COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Cuba on 11 March 2020 when three Italian tourists tested positive for the virus.


== Background ==
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.Cuba is a country that has sent medical personnel to other parts of the world during recent decades. In 2014 the WHO supported the deployment of medical personnel from Cuba to Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic. Cuba's “medical internationalism” has played an important role in the COVID-19 crisis. Cuba has sent medical personnel to the hardest-hit Italian wealthy region of Lombardy and Angola and a dozen Caribbean states including Suriname. However, Cuba is also facing challenges on a domestic level. First of all, it has a precarious domestic health system that is no longer what it used to be. Health professionals are facing challenges, such as shortage of medical supply, poor sanitary conditions and low wages. Cuba also has one of the oldest populations in the continent, together with Uruguay. With one-quarter of the population being considered part of the population at-risk, the poor health system might lead to a high death toll during the pandemic. In addition, Cuba's economy has been precarious for the last two years. It is threatened by a deeper deterioration of the economic situation due to the decrease in tourism and by remittances [explain?]. As a consequence, the government began centralizing economic decision-making in order to avoid a deeper economic crisis like the one experienced by the country after the end of the Cold War.
