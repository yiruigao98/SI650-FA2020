== History ==

Longsight is an ethnically diverse area, with high levels of poverty, deprivation and crime.
For many years, Longsight has been plagued by gang related violence, similar to that of nearby Moss Side. Most of the violence came from tensions between two rival gangs which fought "turf wars" with each other since the 1990s, resulting in many shootings and several deaths. The Gooch Gang, from neighbouring Moss Side, were jailed in 2009, Consequently, gun crime in Greater Manchester as a whole has fallen dramatically, from a high of 120 gang-related shootings in 2006 to just 16 in 2011.

One 0-6-0 was produced in 1858 but then the works closed down as the LNWR transferred its operations to Crewe.
