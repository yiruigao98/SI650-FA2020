== History ==
Lianzhou became part of the Changsha Commandery during the Qin dynasty. During the Han dynasty, which began in 206 BC, the Yangxian prefecture consisted of three cities: Lianzhou, Liannan, and Lianshan. Emperor Kaihuang later put Lianzhou in the Ben prefecture during the Sui dynasty (581–618 AD).
On December 8, 1949, the Communist People's Liberation Army took over Lianzhou, then called Lianxian, from the Kuomintang. On December 20, 1949, the People’s Government of Lianxian was established. On April 22, 1994, Lianxian was renamed Lianzhou City. In 1996, the government of Guangdong Province named Lianzhou as a National Famous Historic and Cultural City.
