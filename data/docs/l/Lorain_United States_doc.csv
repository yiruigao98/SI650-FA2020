(Per official local-government records) the City began as an unincorporated village established pre-1834 as “Black River Village”, but in 1837 (also per local-government records) the name was officially changed in 1837 to ‘Charleston’, (however, according to 19th-century historians, the name ‘Charleston’ was almost immediately rejected by its own citizens, who continued to utilize the former name, Black River Village until 1873). It was subsequently incorporated as a village under the name Lorain in 1874 and became a City in 1896. The first mayor of the City of Lorain is credited as Conrad Reid, beginning his term on April 6, 1874.
