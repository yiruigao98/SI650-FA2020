This is a list of universities in Nigeria. Nigeria is organised into 36 states and a federal capital territory (FCT). As a result of the oil boom years of the 1970s, tertiary level of education was expanded to reach every sub-region of Nigeria. The federal government and the state governments were previously the only bodies licensed to operate universities. Recently, licenses have been granted to individuals, corporate bodies and religious bodies to establish private universities in the country.
The National Universities Commission (NUC) is the major accreditation and regulatory body that enforces uniform standard and sets admissions capacity of every university in Nigeria.
^Note 1  - Established in 1853 as a CMS Training Institution in Abeokuta prior to its relocation to Lagos from 1868 to 1896. It was retrospectively established at Oyo in March 1920.
