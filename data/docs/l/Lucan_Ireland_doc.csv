Lucan ( LOO-kən; (Irish: "Leamhcán" meaning "Place of the Elms") is a suburban town and village located roughly 12km west of Dublin City Centre on the River Liffey. It is located near the Strawberry Beds and Lucan Weir, and at the confluence of the River Griffeen. The majority of the area lies under the jurisdiction of South Dublin County Council while a small portion north of the River Liffey, including Laraghcon, Westmanstown, St Catherine's Park and Lucan Demesne, lies within the jurisdiction of Fingal County Council. Main road access to Lucan is from the N4, and the M50 motorway at Junction 7.


== Etymology ==
In the Irish language, 'leamhachán' refers to the marsh-mallow plant, used up to modern times in folk medicine (for sprains and chest infections) and sweet manufacture, and so the name could be rendered as "place of marsh-mallow plants" or "land abounding in marsh-mallows."  The plant grows in the Liffey Valley and surrounds, as recorded in the 1837 Ainmleabhar Paróiste, reported by Jackson (1914). In 1615, the placename was described as meaning 'a marshy place'.


== History ==


=== Early history ===
There is evidence of prehistoric settlement in Lucan as the features that attracted early people such as river access, fishing, well-drained soil and hunting were all around. There is significant prehistoric activity in the Cooldrinagh townland of Lucan, with early Mesolithic flints found in significant quantities, as well as the remains of two small kerbed passage tombs. In the area around Vesey Park there are remains of a hillfort (Knockanardousk "hill of the high water") that may have been the house and enclosure of an early lord of Lucan in medieval times. This enclosure also contained a souterrain, excavated in the 18th century by George Petrie and of which, some of the finds are in the National Museum of Ireland.


=== Sarsfields and Veseys ===
When Oliver Cromwell came to Ireland, Lucan was a village of 120 inhabitants.
In 1566, Sir William Sarsfield acquired Lucan Manor, and the property became closely associated with the Sarsfield family. Patrick Sarsfield, the Irish Jacobite leader, was born in the castle that had occupied the manor grounds and was granted the title Earl of Lucan by King James II.Lucan House was built on the site of Sarsfield's castle in 1772, by the Rt Hon. Agmondisham Vesey, who was descended from the Sarsfield family. The circular ground floor dining room is said to have been an inspiration for the Oval Office of the White House. The decorative plasterwork was carried out by Michael Stapleton. Over the years, the house passed out of the Vesey family and, since 1942, has been the residence of the Italian ambassador to Ireland. In the grounds of the house is the spa, the waters of which attracted people to the town in previous times.
The influence of the Sarsfield and Vesey families on Lucan is still apparent in the area. For example, the local Gaelic Athletic Association club is Lucan Sarsfields and a pub in the village bears the name 'The Vesey Arms'.


=== Spa ===
The discovery of a sulphurous spa in Lucan in 1758 brought the district into prominence, and it became a mecca for weekend parties from Dublin and the surrounding countryside. A ballroom was erected and subsequently a hotel.


=== 19th century onwards ===
Most of the structures in Lucan village were constructed as part of a large redevelopment around 1815.  Later, Lucan was a terminus on the combination of tram lines serving Lucan and Leixlip from Dublin city centre.


== Transport and access ==
Lucan village is located north of the N4/M4 national primary route to the west and northwest of Ireland. The village is approximately 5 km (3.1 mi) west of the M50 Dublin ring road. An outer-orbital distributor called the Outer Ring Road, designated as R136, from the N4 (Woodies) interchange to the N81 Tallaght Bypass, was completed in 2008.
Lucan is located between two major national/commuter railway lines. The original Lucan North (Leixlip) Station on the north/northwest line, and Lucan South station on the south/southwest line, were closed in 1941 and 1947, respectively. The greenfield development of the Lucan townlands as a major residential area was predicated on the prime location between the motorways and railways. Adamstown railway station re-opened in 2007 to serve the area; it is located south of Finnstown, Lucan. This station will also service significant further developments planned to the south of Adamstown townlands and the south/southwest commuter line.
In 2018 it was announced that the Luas is planned to be extended to Lucan under the governments 'Project Ireland 2040' transport plan.

The estate passed through the Sarsfield, Vesey and Colthurst families through marriage and also was once the resident of Charles Hugh O'Conor, the third son of Charles Owen O'Conor and then, in 1954, it was purchased by the Italian Government for use as the residence of the Italian Ambassador to Ireland.
