=== Limbdi Satyagrah ===
During the Satyagraha, the people of Limbdi formed a "Praja Mandal" on 24 December 1938, which caused friction between the king and the people of Limbdi. In 1939, a conference was held by "Praja Mandal", which the king did not like and he created a huge uproar at the conference. Many people were wounded during this incident. Many people felt disheartened and started migrating from Limbdi to other cities.
