The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old Hamar (Norse Hamarr) farm, since the first church was built there. The name is identical with the word hamarr (rocky hill).

It is also mentioned in the Old Norse sagas as Litlikaupangr ("Little Trading Place").

The coat-of-arms was granted in 1898 and shows a birkebeiner, carrying a spear and a shield, who is skiing down a mountainside.  It symbolizes the historical importance of when the Birkebeiners carried the to-be-King Haakon from Lillehammer to Rena on skis.

There has been no overnight air frost in August since 1978 (the record low for that month being -0.6° C (30.9° F), a sufficient temperature for air frost), and the coldest recorded temperature after 2000 is -26.2 °C in January 2010.

The basis for the city's commerce is its position as the northernmost point of the lake Mjøsa and as the gateway for the Gudbrandsdal region, through which the historical highway to Trondheim passes.  The Mesna river has provided the basis for several small industries through the years, but Lillehammer is now all but industry-less.
