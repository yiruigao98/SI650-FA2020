Lospalos (sometimes written as Los Palos) is a city in East Timor, 248 kilometres (154 mi) to the east of Dili, the national capital. Lospalos has a population of 17,186 (2006) and is the capital of  Lautém District and the Lospalos Subdistrict. The subdistrict has a population of 25,417 (2004).
Internationally, "Lospalos" is mistakenly spelled as Los Palos, suggesting a Spanish origin of the name. In fact, it is derived from Lohoasupala, the name in Fataluku, the local Papuan language, although nowadays Fataluku speakers use the name Lospala. The preferred spelling in English, as well as Tetum and Portuguese, the official languages of East Timor, is Lospalos.
Lospalos is the birth city of the co-founder and president of the party APODETI, Frederico Almeida Santos Costa.
