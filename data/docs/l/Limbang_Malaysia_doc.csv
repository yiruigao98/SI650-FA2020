Limbang is a border town and the capital of Limbang District in the Limbang Division of northern Sarawak, East Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. It is located on the banks of the Limbang River (Sungai Limbang in Malay), between the two halves of Brunei.


== Etymology ==
A settlement along the Limbang River was previously known as "Pangkalan Tarap" where trade activities thrived. The name was derived from a well-known fruit in the Malay community. However, the settlement was combined with Trusan district and Lawas district, "Pangkalan Tarap" changed its name to "Limbang", naming it after the river on which it is situated.


== History ==

In 1884, there was a rebellion by Limbang residents protesting against the high tax rate imposed by the Bruneian Empire, "necessary" because of British and Sarawakian expansion under Charles Venyer Brooke. Pengiran Temanggong Pengiran Anak Hashim, who was poised to become Sultan Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin in 1885, was unable to contain the revolt, which was instigated by the White Rajah. Pengiran Anak Hashim initially sought help from Rajah Charles Brooke, but failed to end the rebellion. Pengiran Anak Hashim then sought help from the acting British Royal Consul at Labuan and the rebellion was suppressed.
Sultan Hashim was then pressured by the North Borneo Chartered Company (NBCC) and Charles Brooke to cede the Trusan, Padas, and Limbang districts. Sultan Hashim submitted to the pressure and ceded Trusan district in 1885 and Padas district in 1887 but refused to relinquish Limbang. This is because Limbang was the rice bowl for Brunei, and the Limbang river had historically been Bruneian. On 17 September 1888, Brunei signed an agreement with Great Britain which formally put Brunei under British protectorate, hoping to stem further losses of territories to the Brooke government or NBCC. However, on 17 March 1890, Rajah Charles Brooke announced that Limbang was to be part of the Kingdom of Sarawak. Brunei tried to seek help from Britain regarding the loss of the Limbang territory but to no avail. To this date, Brunei still claims Limbang as hers as it was forcibly and illegally taken.
Between 1899 and 1901, another rebellion occurred in Tutong District and Belait District. Sultan Hashim was again pressured to cede both the districts, but he firmly refused, as loss of both districts would make Brunei non-existent on the map of Borneo, resembling "a tree without branches".During the Brunei Revolt in 1962, Limbang was occupied by the North Borneo Liberation Army (Tentera Nasional Kalimantan Utara, TNKU). TNKU killed four members of the police and eleven European civilians including the Limbang district officer and his wife. Within five days, British and Australian forces from Singapore contained the rebellion.

The crossing was only possible by ferry until the completion of the Pandaruan or Brunei-Malaysia Friendship Bridge on 8 December 2013. The checkpoint on the Brunei side is called Ujung Jalan.As the only road connection to outside the district is through Brunei, one must have a passport to travel into or out of Limbang.
