La Goulette, known in Arabic as Halq al-Wadi (Arabic: حلق الوادي‎ Ḥalq el-Wād), is the port of Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. The Kasbah fortress was built in 1535 by Charles I of Spain but was captured by the Ottoman Turks in 1574. La Goulette is located at around 36°49′5″N 10°18′18″E.
The name derives from the "gullet", a channel where the city is located, not from the ship type schooner, called goélette, gulet, goleta or goletta in French, Turkish, Spanish and Italian.
La Goulette is linked to Tunis by the TGM railway.
