== History ==

In 1767, Johann Schobert, a German composer at the Palace of Versailles went mushroom picking with his family in Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, and died after insisting on eating them in a soup after two chefs told him that they were poisonous.
On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, a large part of the commune of Le Pré-Saint-Gervais was annexed to Paris, and forms now the neighborhood of Pré-Saint-Gervais, in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, leaving Le Pré-Saint-Gervais as a rump commune.
