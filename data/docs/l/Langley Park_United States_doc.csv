Langley is an unincorporated community in the census-designated place of McLean in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. Langley is often used as a metonym for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as it is home to its headquarters, the George Bush Center for Intelligence. The land which makes up Langley today once belonged to Thomas Lee, former Crown Governor of the Colony of Virginia from 1749 to 1750. Lee’s land was named Langley in honor of Langley Hall, which was part of the Lee home estate in Shropshire, England. In 1839, 700 acres (283 ha) of land was purchased by Benjamin Mackall from the Lee family, while keeping the name.The community was essentially absorbed into McLean many years ago, although there is still a Langley High School. In addition to being a bedroom community for Washington, D.C. and home to the CIA's headquarters, the area is the site of the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center of the Federal Highway Administration and the Claude Moore Colonial Farm of the National Park Service.
