La Plata (Spanish pronunciation: [la ˈplata]) is the capital city of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. According to the 2010 census [INDEC], it has a population of 765,378 and its metropolitan area has 899,523 inhabitants.
La Plata was planned and developed to serve as the provincial capital after the city of Buenos Aires was federalized in 1880. It was officially founded by Governor Dardo Rocha on 19 November 1882. Its construction is fully documented in photographs by Tomás Bradley Sutton. La Plata was briefly known as Ciudad Eva Perón (Eva Perón City) between 1952 and 1955.
The city is home to two important first division football teams: Estudiantes de La Plata and Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata.


== History and description ==

Rocha decided to erect a new city to host the provincial government institutions and a university which had already been planned. Urban planner Pedro Benoit designed a city layout based on a rationalist conception of urban centers. The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north to south and east to west. In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonal streets. This design is copied in a self-similar manner in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. For every six blocks, there is a small park or square. Other than the diagonal streets, all streets are on a rectangular grid and are numbered consecutively. Thus, La Plata is nicknamed "la ciudad de las diagonales" (city of diagonals). It is also called "la ciudad de los tilos" (city of linden trees), because of the large number of linden trees lining the many streets and squares. The linden tree is one of a number of deciduous Northern Hemisphere tree species which dominate La Plata's parks and streets; ash, horsechestnut, plane, sweetgum and tulip tree are among the other examples. Palms and subtropical broadleaf evergreen trees thrive but are comparatively infrequent.
The city design and its buildings are noted to possess a strong Freemason symbolism. This is said to be a consequence of both Rocha and Benoit being Freemasons.The designs for the government buildings were chosen in an international architectural competition. Thus, the Governor Palace was designed by Italians, the City Hall by Germans, etc. Electric street lighting was installed in 1884 and was the first of its kind in Latin America.

The neo-Gothic cathedral of La Plata is the largest church in Argentina.
The Teatro Argentino de La Plata is one of the most important opera houses in Argentina, second to the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. The theatre was built on the square block between 9th and 10th Street and 51st and 53rd Avenue. It was opened on 19 November 1890. It was designed by Leopoldo Rochi in Renaissance style. The work was funded by the first inhabitants of La Plata, but as maintenance was very expensive, it was later donated to the Province of Buenos Aires. In the foyer, entering through the majestic doors, there was a beautiful white Carrara marble staircase. In the concert hall, hangs a huge chandelier with trimmings suspended from the ceiling. The easy chairs were tapestried in blue velveteen and the Bordeaux curtain was embroidered in gold. It had marvelous acoustics. In those years, the students of the Verdi Conservatory of Music performed in the theatre, their annual show of classical Spanish and folklore dances with the teachers Carmen de Toledo, Mrs. Schubert and Nelly Rossotti respectively. Surrounding the theatre was the "Peace Garden," containing flags and national flowers of several countries. People strolled and children played along its stony paths. However, fate decreed that it would not be saved from a fire on 18 October 1977 at 2.30 p.m. This has been noted as one of the largest losses to La Plata's historical heritage. It was later replaced by a new building, which houses the theatre's orchestra, choir and ballet, boasting several halls.

The Curutchet House is one of the two buildings by Le Corbusier built in the Americas.
The University of La Plata was founded in 1897 and nationalized in 1905. It is well known for its observatory and natural history museum. Ernesto Sabato graduated in Physics at this university; he went on to teach at the Sorbonne and the MIT before becoming a famed novelist. Doctor René Favaloro was another famous alumnus. During its early years, the university attracted a number of renowned intellectuals from the Spanish-speaking world, such as Dominican Pedro Henríquez Ureña.
San Ponciano church is on the corner of 48th and 5th Streets. It was the first chapel in La Plata, inaugurated on 19 November 1883, the first anniversary of the foundation of the city. The project belongs to Pedro Benoit, who was also the designer of the city plan. Its neo-Gothic style has been well kept, and the inner paintings are now being restored. The founder of the city, Dardo Rocha, named it "San Ponciano" in memory of his son, Ponciano. St. Ponciano was born in Rome. In 230 he was elected as Bishop of Rome and Pope. Because of the Christian persecution, he was forced into exile to Sardinia Island. In 235 he resigned his position as pope because he did not want to leave the Church in a difficult situation during his absence. He died in 235 and was buried in the catacombs of Saint Callixtus among eight other Popes. Inside the church is the "Virgen de Luján" niche, which was moved here in 1904.


=== La Plata in the 20th century ===
Under Alvear's administration (1922–1928), Enrique Mosconi, the president of the state oil company Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, created the La Plata distillery, at the time the tenth largest in the world.

On 10 December 1945, in the Parish church of St. Francis of Assisi in this city, Juan Domingo Perón and Eva Duarte were married.In 1952 the city was renamed Ciudad Eva Perón, though its original name was restored in 1955. Several daily newspapers are published there, the most prominent of which is El Día.
In March 1976 the Argentine military seized power following a coup d'état, which involved the disappearing of a number of students from La Plata. The military junta had implemented what was called the National Reorganization Process which was a set of policies used by the regime to destroy left-wing guerrilla forces and oppress resistance to its rule. The process included kidnappings, torture and murder. Meanwhile, the Montoneros, a leftist guerilla group, responded violently to the junta and its actions as they enlisted other Argentines to join their campaign against the regime. Those enlisted included young, left-wing, politically active students from the organization named the Unión de Estudiantes Secundarios (Union of High School Students) of La Plata. The UES was committed to achieving school reforms and other political reforms, through demonstrations and protests that irked the ruling regime. Many of these kidnapped students were killed and their whereabouts are unknown, very few were able to survive this experience, one of these was released at the end of the film.
In October 1998, UNESCO approved the city's bid to gain recognition as a World Heritage site. The approval is still pending due to various objections to the criterion of maintaining architectural and landscape features during recent decades, which in the opinion of other specialists, has caused severe damage to the original design and contextual aesthetics.

La Plata is a planned city, urban planning paradigm of the late 19th century. It is also an example of "hygiene", which was becoming important in that time.
The trace of the city, designed by architect Pedro Benoit, characterized by a strict grid, and its many avenues and diagonals. The convergence of the two major diagonals, 73 and 74, which cross the city from east to west and from north to south, respectively, takes place in Plaza Moreno. This square, in whose center is the foundation stone, the heart of the city, is the main square of the city and it is between the City Hall and the cathedral located at 14 N ° 1943 between 51 and 53, High Gothic, with its towers 112 m high, could be completed only in 1999. Highlights of the city are the Museum of Natural Sciences, the building of the Interior, the Provincial Legislature, the new theater and the hippodrome. Many of these buildings were built at the time of the founding of the city, following an international call for proposals. They are often called "buildings erected" and most of them are on the shaft foundation, which blocks are located between 51st and 53rd streets.
Another work is the parent company of Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, located between the streets 6, 7, 46 and 47. This building was designed by architects Juan A. Buschiazzo and Luis Viglione. It opened on 19 April 1886, being amended in 1913 and in the 1970s.

== Carnival ==
Carnival is one of the major popular celebrations in the history of mankind. This celebration has its origins in the pagan rituals of Bacchus, the God of wine. The first Carnival goes back more than five thousand years to one of the ancient civilizations and historical regions in southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq, then it passed on to Egypt and finally to the Roman Empire. From there it was celebrated throughout Europe and it was brought to America by the Spanish and Portuguese sailors. The term carnival comes from the Latin expression "meat Levarium", which means to remove the flesh, referring to the prohibition of eating meat during forty days after
this celebration takes place. In recent times Carnival is one of the most popular celebrations, with shows, parades in costumes; however, the original sense it had at the beginning has changed nowadays. Among the most widely known carnival celebrations, we have the one in Gualeguaychu, province of Entre Rìos, Argentina. Up to now Carnival is celebrated most of all in the northern provinces in our
