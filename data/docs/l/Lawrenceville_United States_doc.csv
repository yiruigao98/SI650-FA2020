== History ==
Lawrenceville was incorporated by an act of the Georgia General Assembly on December 15, 1821. This makes Lawrenceville the second oldest city in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The city is named after Commodore James Lawrence, commander of the frigate Chesapeake during the War of 1812. Lawrence, a native of New Jersey, is probably best known today for his dying command, "Don't give up the ship!" William Maltbie, the town's first postmaster, suggested the name of "Lawrenceville."
In 1821, a permanent site for the county courthouse was selected and purchased, the four streets bordering the square were laid out along with other streets in the village, and a public well was dug. Major Grace built the first permanent courthouse, a brick structure, in 1823–24 for a cost of $4,000. The courthouse presently on the square was constructed in 1885.
Courtland Winn served two terms as mayor starting in 1884 when he was 21 years old.
The two most famous people born in Lawrenceville gained their fame elsewhere. Charles Henry Smith, born in 1826, left as a young man and lived most of his life in other Georgia towns. During the Civil War he wrote humorous pieces for Atlanta newspapers under the name Bill Arp. He has been described as the South's most popular writer of the late 19th century, though he is not much read today. Ezzard Charles, born in 1921, grew up in Cincinnati, where opportunities for African-Americans were far better at the time than in the Deep South. He eventually became the World Heavyweight boxing champion by defeating Joe Louis by unanimous decision on September 27, 1950.
Another resident, Oliver Hardy, became a world-renowned comic actor, a member of the film duo Laurel and Hardy from the 1920s to the 1940s. He lived as a child in downtown Lawrenceville around 1900. But his stay was brief since his family moved often within Georgia.

Lawrenceville was one of many venues in the nation where Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt faced obscenity charges in the late 1970s. On March 6, 1978, during a lunch break in his Lawrenceville trial, he and his local attorney Gene Reeves were shot by a sniper near the courthouse. Both survived, though Flynt was seriously disabled. Years later, imprisoned serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin claimed to have been the shooter, but he never produced any proof and was not charged in the case. (Franklin was executed in 2013 in Missouri for a 1977 sniper slaying.) A heavily fictionalized treatment of the Flynt shooting can be seen in the 1996 movie The People vs. Larry Flynt.
Since 1988, Lawrenceville has been the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church in America.

Lawrenceville's revitalization plan was strengthened in 2005 when the city crafted a unique partnership with Aurora Theatre (Gwinnett County's only professional theatre), which relocated from the nearby town of Duluth to a permanent site in downtown Lawrenceville in May 2007 for the opening of its 11th season. Now in its 23rd season, Aurora Theatre (http://www.auroratheatre.com/), is the second largest professional theatre in Georgia, produces 800 ticketed events a year, attracts 80,000 visitors, and conducts the Lawrenceville Ghost Tours, a 90-minute walking tour of the historic downtown area led by professional storytellers. Ghost tour guides recount town lore and legends including reports of paranormal activity at the historic courthouse and the Female Seminary. Co-Founded in 1996 by Anthony Rodriguez and Ann-Carol Pence, Aurora Theatre works to be both a community partner and destination location. On the brink of another campus expansion, the new expanded Lawrenceville Performing Arts Center, when completed, will house four performance spaces and encompass an entire city block of Lawrenceville's historic downtown.
Each August, the city hosts the annual Polish Pierogi Festival. There are food booths set up serving pierogi, kielbasa and sauerkraut. There are also live music performances, and other events include the Pierogi Toss and eating competitions.
