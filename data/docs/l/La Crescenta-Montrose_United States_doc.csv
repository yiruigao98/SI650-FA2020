== Politics ==

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) operates the Crescenta Valley Station in La Crescenta, serving La Crescenta and Montrose.


== History ==
The area was originally part of the homelands of the Tongva people. It became part of Rancho La Cañada, a Mexican land grant given in 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to a Mexican schoolteacher from Pueblo de Los Ángeles, Ygnacio Coronel (1795–1862).
La Crescenta does not mean "the crescent," which in Spanish would be el creciente. From his home, early settler Benjamin B. Briggs "could see three crescent-shaped formations, which suggested to him the artificial name," accepted by the U.S. Post Office in 1888. Montrose was chosen "as the result of a contest for the subdivision established in 1913 on part of the La Crescenta development.


=== The Great Flood of 1934 ===
In November 1933, wildfires raged through the nearby San Gabriel mountains above the communities of La Crescenta, La Cañada and Montrose. During the last week of December of that year, a series of winter storms pounded the mountainside with 12 inches of rain. On New Year's Eve, more heavy rains led to sporadic flooding.
Around midnight, hillsides in at least three mountain locations collapsed sending millions of tons of mud and debris into the Crescenta Valley neighborhoods below.More than 400 homes were destroyed in La Cañada, La Crescenta, Montrose and Tujunga. Scores of people were killed, and hundreds were left homeless. Entire families were wiped out. The mudslides that began in the mountains above La Cañada and La Crescenta carved a path of destruction all the way to the Verdugo Wash and beyond.
Some Montrose residents sought shelter from flooding at American Legion Post 288, which was destroyed, killing 12.

Parts of Foothill Boulevard were buried under 12 feet (4 m) of mud, boulders and debris. The mud was deep enough to bury cars completely on Montrose Avenue. Miles of Honolulu Boulevard were inundated by several feet of sand and silt.
Two notable victims of the flood were silent-era identical-twin child actors Winston and Weston Doty, who died at the age of 19.Following the disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the County of Los Angeles built a flood control system of catch basins and concrete storm drains, designed to prevent a repeat of the 1934 disaster.The flood was commemorated in Woody Guthrie's song "Los Angeles New Year's Flood".  To honor the victims of that New Year's calamity and to mark its 75th anniversary a small monument was dedicated January 1, 2004, at Rosemont and Fairway Avenues, in Montrose, near where the American Legion Hall had stood.


== In popular culture ==
In the spring of 2012, a large black bear managed to wander regularly from the Angeles National Forest into the La Crescenta-Montrose-Glendale residential area, rummaging through trash cans and showing a preference for Costco meatballs and tuna. The bear was subdued in La Crescenta and returned to the forest. A Twitter account from an individual posting as "GlenBearian" appeared with updates from the bear's perspective.The historic 1946 La Crescenta Motel, formerly known as the May Lane Motel, with its classic postwar L-shaped layout on Foothill Blvd., has been used as a location for numerous feature films and television shows, such as Glee, Criminal Minds, Mad Men and True Blood.Rockhaven Sanitarium on Honolulu Avenue, built entirely of rock, opened in 1923. It became known as the "Screen Actors' Sanitarium," housing such patients as Billie Burke and Gladys Baker, mother of Marilyn Monroe. Closed in 2006, the property was purchased by the City of Glendale in 2008. As of early 2016, the site is being considered for "adaptive reuse."Another, more notorious sanitarium existed in La Crescenta from the 1920s to the early 1960s. A few yards west of the La Crescenta Motel, on the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Rosemont Avenue, is the site of the Kimball Sanitarium, which was housed in a large, foreboding, converted Victorian mansion built in the 1880s.  Bela Lugosi attempted to overcome his morphine addiction at the Kimball, as represented in the Tim Burton film Ed Wood.  Actress Frances Farmer, misdiagnosed as a "paranoid schizophrenic," received insulin shock therapy at Kimball. Plans to expand the sanitarium were rejected by local residents in the early 1960s and the sanitarium was finally torn down.   Construction workers readying the building for demolition found padded cells, straight-jackets and manacles attached to the walls. The site became a shopping plaza, and a Ralphs supermarket currently occupies the spot where the disreputable sanitarium once stood.During an as-yet undiagnosed episode of manic depression (bipolarism) in 1996, actress Margot Kidder attempted to walk 12 miles from downtown Los Angeles to the La Crescenta home of her friend, writer Rosie Shuster. Kidder was discovered in Glendale and hospitalized.

=== Crescenta Valley Town Council ===
The Crescenta Valley Town Council (CVTC) is composed of nine democratically elected councilmembers, each of whom serve three-year terms upon installation. The official purpose of the council is to listen to, address, and communicate "residents’ needs, ideas, and concerns to the appropriate public agencies, City, County and State, including, [but not limited to, the Hon. Kathryn Barger]," the Fifth District's and La Crescenta-Montrose's official, elected representative on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. To that end, the Council is currently the Los Angeles County unincorporated area's main advisory body to the County Supervisor's office & other governing agencies, as well as an organized institution that is often counted on to facilitate community-wide forums to inform or garner opinion from residents.
Currently, the council has no open seats, regular or alternate. As of December 15, 2016, the town council is under the leadership of first-time president Harry Leon and first-time vice president Michael Claessens, who preside over meetings. The other seven councilmembers are: Mrs. Mariam Barnes, Ms. Leslie Dickson, Mr. Sophal Ear, Mrs. Lisa Griffin, Mr. Brandon M. Lee, Mr. Aram Ordubegian, and Mrs. Desiree Rabinov. The three alternate members for the 2016-17 governing year are the two first alternates, Mrs. Jo Ann Stupakis and Mrs. Kyle Studebaker (each tied for the most runner-up votes), and the third alternate, Mr. Charles Beatty.
Runners-up in any given election may be eligible to serve on the council as well, occupying the three Alternate member positions for a term of one year. The Alternate members are selected based on the total number of votes they garnered during the regular election, with the First Alternate being the runner-up who received the most votes, and so-on until all three positions are filled. Alternate members, once installed, may not run to be a regular Councilmember for the duration of their term. While these members are also entitled to full discussion privileges during meetings and may be considered for the Town Council's committee Chairships, the key distinction between regular members and Alternate members is that the latter may not vote on any decisive matters, nor initiate binding motions during Town Council meetings. Regardless, there are some exceptions to this limitation, though, such as: when regular members of the Council are absent at general meetings, or; when they are participating as members or Chairs on the Town Council's various committee/sub-committee meetings.
Lee, Leon, and Ordubegian all won the most recent Town Council election, with Leon securing his reelection bid, Ordubegian advancing from his Alternate member position, and Lee, a 22-year-old local teacher, narrowly defeating both Studebaker and Stupakis by a margin of 1.5% of total votes. The election featured seven, and, at one point, eight hopefuls all competing for the three available Councilmember seats; only one of those seats did not have an incumbent running for reelection. The Council also internally elects a board of five officers—including the President and Vice President—who comprise the Council's official "Executive Committee". For 2017, President Leon and Vice President Claessens are joined by Councilmember(s) Mariam Barnes, Aram Ordubegian, and Sophal Ear, who were elected to hold the posts of Treasurer, Recording Secretary, and Corresponding Secretary, respectively.

== Points of historical interest ==
St. Luke's of the Mountains Episcopal Church was designed and built by the famous artist Seymour Thomas in 1924. Constructed of natural stone from the valley, it is reminiscent of a woodlands church in northern Europe. It is considered to be the architectural centerpiece of the valley. St. Luke's is located at 2563 Foothill Blvd.
Le Mesnager Barn is a stone barn perched high above the valley, built in 1911 by George Le Mesnager, a French patriot, to store and process grapes from his vineyards in the Sparr Heights area. These grapes supplied his "Old Hermatage Vinyards" winery in downtown Los Angeles. There is still a Mesnager Street in the downtown area where the winery had been located. It is owned by the City of Glendale, which plans to restore it as an educational nature/history center. Le Mesnager Barn is located in Deukmejian Wilderness Park at the top of Dunsmore Ave.La Crescenta is home to one of two American ashrams founded by Indian teacher and mystic poet Swami Paramananda who came to America in 1906. Founded in 1923, the Ananda Ashrama is located at the top of Pennsylvania Avenue near Deukmejian Wilderness Park.The La Crescenta Woman's Club began in 1911, incorporated in 1923, and built its beautiful clubhouse in 1925. The structure has been the social center of the valley for most of the last century, and is the home for the organization's many charitable and social events. The La Crescenta Woman's Club is located at 4004 La Crescenta Avenue.
Sparr Heights Community Center was built early in 1922 by William S. Sparr as the real estate office for the Sparr Heights residential tract, originally named Oakmont Park. It was subsequently donated to the City of Glendale on December 24, 1922, and has been a community meeting place and senior center since then. Sparr Heights Community Center is located at 1613 Glencoe Way, across the street from John C. Fremont Elementary School.La Crescenta Elementary School was built in 1887 at the corner of Foothill and Dyer, but soon moved to a new location at La Crescenta and Prospect. A wooden schoolhouse was built on this site in 1890. A larger school building replaced it in 1914, and the present structure was erected in 1948.
The Old School Bell: La Crescenta's school bell first rang students to school from across the valley in 1890. It was placed in storage from 1948 until 1976, when it was re-hung and dedicated with a plaque listing the names of the kids in the first class at La Crescenta Elementary. The bell is now rung once a year in June by the graduating students. The Bell is located in front of La Crescenta Elementary School.
La Crescenta Presbyterian Church is a striking church building constructed in 1923. This is one of the oldest congregations in the valley, first meeting in the 1880s. In the congregation's early years they shared facilities with the elementary school, as did the Episcopals that later built St. Luke's. La Crescenta Presbyterian Church is located at 2902 Montrose Avenue.
