== History ==
The early history of Lago da Pedra begins in 1929, with the arrival of the first residents: Rosendo Rodrigues, Cândido Adão Sales de Oliveira, Joaquim Bastos, José Gago, José Melquíades and Luciano Rodrigues, farmers who were looking for animals for subsistence, which led them to find the region that possessed in its geographical landscape a large lake, whose banks had a rocky fragment of whetstone, a fact that was able to hold the attention of those residents.
In 1931, the arrival of other residents was intensified, so starting the building of the first houses. The main activity at that time was subsistence farming, provided by exceptional weather and soil conditions.
The district which today corresponds to the Municipality of Lago da Pedra was created under the name District of Jejuí, by State Law number 269 of December 31, 1948, on which District of Jejuí was subordinated to the Municipality of Vitória do Mearim, a situation reinforced by territorial division of July 1, 1950. Elevated to a municipality-level under the name of Municipality of Lago da Pedra by State Law number 776 of October 2, 1952, District of Jejuí was so dismembered from Vitória do Mearim, being so established on January 1, 1953. After emancipation, Antonio da Silva Coelho was appointed as provisional administrator, ruling for two years, being replaced by Antonio Bandeira Lima, who ruled for one year.
