== History ==


=== Second World War and Japanese Occupation ===
Early in the campaign, Japanese forces invaded and occupied on the town of Lucban. On December 26, 1941, Filipino and American troops defended Barrio Piis and the attack by the Japanese shifted to the Bataan Peninsula. After the Japanese forces occupied the town, they built a military garrison and Japanese Armed Forces were stationed in Lucban. Both local guerrilla and regular troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army initiated attacks in Lucban from 1942 to 1945.


=== Sampaloc, Quezon ===
Sampaloc used to be the Barrio Dingin of Lucban, Quezon consisting of three sitios. It was later renamed into Sampaloc because of the presence of a large tamarind tree found in the center of the settlement during the earlier days. The name was also changed in Alfonso Trece for a time to honor the King of Spain. In 1873, Capt. Pedro Cadelina of Lucban recommended to change the barrio into a municipality but due to lack of residents, it was only made into a “visita”. “Teniente Mayores” were appointed to head the ”visita”, the first of whom was from Polilio, followed by Arcadio Veluya, Laureano Nanola, Silverio Abueva and Juan Saludades. Through the efforts of Juan Pineda, Sampaloc became a municipality in 1892. He was elected as the first Capitan. He was succeeded by Diego Gagan followed by Teofilo Daya in 1901. During Daya's term in the office, three more barrios from Mauban – Banot, Bilucao and San Bueno, became a part of Sampaloc through the efforts of Ireneo Domeo, the municipal secretary. The town was also renamed to Sampaloc during this time.


== Etymology ==
Legend has it the town derives its name from the lukbán or pomelo tree. Three hunters from neighbouring Majayjay— namely Marcos Tigla, Luis Gamba and Lucas Mañawa— lost their way following the trail of wild animals at the foot of volcanic Mount Banahaw. Resting under a tree, they saw a crow (uwák) in the tree's branches, and believing this to be a bad omen, they moved to another place and rested again. Whilst in the shade of a large pomelo (lucbán) tree, the trio were attracted to a couple of kingfishers (salacsác) that were singing. Fascinated by the bird's plumage and rhythmic chirps, the superstitious hunters took this a sign of good fortune and thus settled in the place they named "Lucbán."
