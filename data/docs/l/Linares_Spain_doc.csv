== History ==
Around the middle of the nineteenth century Linares became an important mining center with lead mines nearby.  The smelting of lead, the manufacture of lead sheets and pipes, and the production of by-product silver from the lead ores led to a significant population increase.  The  6,000 inhabitants in  1849 became 36,000 in 1877.  This commercial and industrial growth brought the concession of the title of city in 1875.

The lead mines of Linares were in almost interrupted activity from pre-Roman times until the 1990s. There were also lead smelters and gunpowder, dynamite and rope factories as auxiliary to the mining industry. Currently, the mines of Linares are protected as cultural heritage.
