Leduc () is a city in the province of Alberta, Canada. It is 33 km (21 mi) south of the provincial capital of Edmonton and is part of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region.


== History ==
Leduc was established in 1899, when Robert Telford, a settler, bought land near a lake which would later bear his name. It was on that piece of land where the new settlement would take root. Telford previously served as an officer for the North-West Mounted Police, and later became Leduc's first postmaster, first general merchantman, and first justice of the peace.
The establishment of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway, later acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway, opened the region to settlement. The first train stopped at Leduc in July 1891.
Originally there were two versions to describe how Leduc got its name. In fact both accounts are true. In April 1886 when a settler (McKinley) setting up a telegraph office needed a name for the new station and decided that it would be named after the first person who came through the door of the telegraph office. That person was Father Hippolyte Leduc, a priest who had served the area since 1867. Five years later, in 1891, the Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who had been Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Edgar Dewdney (1835–1916), was given a list of names, that had been provided to the railroad by Father Lacombe, decided that Telford Place should be renamed at the time the railway terminal was being established. Father Leduc's name was on the list and since the telegraph station was all ready called Leduc Dewdney saw no reason why not to use Leduc's name for the new railroad station and the hamlet that was growing alongside .
Leduc was incorporated as a village in 1899, and became a town in 1906. It became a city in 1983; by that time its population had reached 12,000.
The town continued to grow quietly over the decades and Alberta's historical oil strike on February 13, 1947, occurred near the town at the Leduc No. 1 oil well.

== Controversies ==


=== Buddy Controversy ===
When cannabis was to be federally legalized on October 17th, 2018,  the City of Leduc needed to inform residents about local public consumption and retail bylaws. On September 19th, 2018 approximately one month prior to the legalization, the City of Leduc introduced residents to a new character “Buddy” via a Facebook post as part of their Cannabis: Need to Know campaign. Buddy’s role was to inform residents of the rules and bylaws surrounding Cannabis use in Leduc. The City’s official Facebook post drew a lot of attention to the campaign with upwards of 24,000 people reached directing 4,000+ hits to the City of Leduc website. Buddy was a personified cannabis leaf’s drawn in the style of a cartoon. He wore blue gloves and blue shoes.
Buddy was not received well by all residents. There was concern from citizens that Buddy’s appearance made cannabis use as a whole appealing to younger demographics. On September 20th a second post was made with a revised version of the character designed to look more authoritative with a clipboard of rules as well as an officer’s style hat.
Three days after the Buddy controversy began, Mayor Bob Young noted that the intended purpose of the spokesbud was “creating conversation in our community that will help ensure people follow the rules”. Within a week, on September 24th, 2018 at a Committee of the Whole meeting, Leduc council addressed and reviewed the Buddy character and post, ultimately choosing to remove the spokesbud from the campaign. The announcement was made by the City of Leduc on September 25th, 2018.
With a population of 32,000+ and the campaign reaching such a large audience, this became quite a large spectacle for the city with outlets such as CTV, Global News, and CBC News covering the controversy.
