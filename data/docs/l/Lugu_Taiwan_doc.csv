Postal codes (Chinese: 郵遞區號; pinyin: Yóudì qūhào; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Iû-tē khu-hō) in Taiwan is a system of three + two digits used by Chunghwa Post.  There are 368 sets of three-digit codes for townships, county-controlled cities, and districts in Taiwan.
The cities of Chiayi and Hsinchu have a single code covering all their districts. The uninhabited islands Pratas (Dongsha) and Spratly (Nansha) each have a single code. The uninhabited Senkaku Islands (Diaoyutai) (administered by Japan) have a code, but there are no deliveries. 
Omitting the supplementary two digits is ordinarily acceptable, but using a five-digit code will speed the delivery of the mail.

== Notes ==
Of the disputed territories, it is practically possible to send mail to Dongsha Island within the Dongsha Islands (817) and Taiping Island, the largest island of the Spratly Islands (819), as those are above sea level and controlled by Taiwan. There is no mail delivery to the Diaoyutai Islands (290), as they are controlled by Japan and have been uninhabited for many decades.
