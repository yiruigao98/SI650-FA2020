== History ==
Langwarrin had two post offices opening after the arrival of the Stony Point railway in 1889, Langwarrin Railway Station on 9 September 1889 and Langwarrin away from the railway on 26 September 1889. Langwarrin closed in 1893 and Langwarrin Railway Station was renamed Langwarrin in 1913.


== Geography ==
It has good access to the City via The Western Port Highway, South Gippsland Highway and Monash Freeway. Cranbourne-Frankston Road which runs east-to-west through Langwarrin is a two-lane-each-direction carriageway, recently widened to cater for this growing population, in part helped by a number of housing developments.
Until December 1994 Langwarrin was part of the City of Cranbourne, formerly the Shire of Cranbourne. At this time the suburb was moved into City of Frankston as part of statewide reform of local government.


=== Langwarrin Flora and Fauna reserve (formerly Langwarrin Military Reserve) ===
Langwarrin's most prominent landscape feature is its large Flora and Fauna reserve (formerly the Langwarrin Military Reserve). The nature reserve has many walking tracks and is an ideal place for quiet recreation activities such as walking, cartwheeling, nature study and photography.
The Langwarrin Military Reserve was established in 1886 at what was then deemed to be a strategic elevated location for the defence of Port Phillip Bay and Melbourne from seaborne attack. Over time it was extended to its present size of 509 acres (2.06 km2).Prior to World War I the reserve was used mainly for temporary encampments of volunteer soldiery from throughout Victoria held at Easter or after New Year. These were held here in
1888, 1891, 1894, 1896, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1904 and 1910 as evidenced by the dates the Langwarrin Camp Post Office was open. The Langwarrin railway station was opened in 1888 next to the facility; in the same year a failed attempt was made to sell allotments on a new township of Aldershot adjoining the reserve. On the outbreak of World War 1 the reserve was used for the detention of enemy aliens (predominantly Germans) and from 1915 a military hospital for combatants with venereal disease was established.
After World War II the reserve was used occasionally for military training, until 1974 when it came under control of the Balcombe Military Camp and was used for training of Army Reserve and school cadet units etc.. In 1980 the reserve was leased to the Victorian Ministry of Conservation and in 1982 the State Government purchased the reserve from the Commonwealth Government.
Today all the buildings are gone. Remaining evidence of past use include earthworks, drainage and foundations and changes in the pattern of vegetation following regrowth after clearing.
