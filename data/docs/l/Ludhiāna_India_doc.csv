Ludhiana is located at 30.9°N 75.85°E﻿ / 30.9; 75.85. It has an average elevation of 244 metres (798 ft). Ludhiana City, to its residents, consists of the Old City and the New City. The new city primarily consists of the Civil Lines area which was historically known as the residential and official quarters of the colonial British encampment.
The land dips steeply to the north and the west where, before 1785, the river Sutlej ran.The Old Fort was at the banks of the Sutlej (and now houses the College of Textile Engineering). Legend has it that a tunnel connects it to the fort in Phillaur – although why this should be is debatable, as the Sutlej was the traditional dividing line between the principalities, often occupied by enemy forces (see History section).
The ground is of yellow sandstone and granite, forming small hillocks, plateaus and dips.The tree of largest natural extraction was the kikar, or Acacia Indica, but has been supplanted by the eucalyptus, transplanted from rural Australia in the late 1950s by the government of Chief Minister Pratap Singh Kairon.
Gulmohars and jacarandas were planted by the British along the avenues of Civil Lines, as were other flowering trees, while the Old City contains almost no vegetation or parks, except for a few isolated pipal trees, holy to the Hindus, as it is supposed to be the abode of Lord Shiva.

== History ==
Ludhiana was founded in 1480 by members of the ruling Lodhi dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The ruling sultan, Sikandar Lodhi, dispatched two ruling chiefs of his dynasty, Yusaf Khan and Nihand Khan, to assert Lodhi control over the region. The two men camped at the site of present Ludhiana, which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusaf Khan crossed the Sutlej and established Sultanpur, while Nihand Khan founded Ludhiana on the site of Mir Hota. The name was originally "Lodhi-ana", meaning "Lodhi town", which has since shifted to the present form of Ludhiana. The Lodhi Fort, or "Purana Qila", is the only surviving structure in the city from this period; located in the neighbourhood of Fatehgarh, it was well-maintained under Ranjit Singh and the British after him, but has since fallen into disrepair and is currently used as a den for gambling and drug use. It was declared a state-protected monument in December 2013.
