Le Creusot (pronounced [lə kʁøzo]) is a commune in the Saône-et-Loire department in the region of Bourgogne in eastern France.
The inhabitants are known as Creusotins. Formerly a mining town, its economy is now dominated by metallurgical companies such as ArcelorMittal, Schneider Electric, and Alstom.
Since the 1990s, the town has been developing its tourism credentials. Its main attraction is the Parc des Combes. The Creusot steam hammer is exposed as a tourist attraction in a square at the entrance to the town from the south.
Le Creusot is also the second educational centre of the Bourgogne (after Dijon), with its IUT and the Condorcet university centre.


== History ==
In 1836, iron ore mines and forges around Le Creusot were bought by Adolphe Schneider and his brother Eugène Schneider. They developed a business in steel, railways, armaments, and shipbuilding. The Schneider empire developed much of the town itself, until it was much reduced in the second half of the twentieth century. It eventually became known as Schneider Electric. The steel forgings for the French nuclear power plants as well as the special alloys for the TGV trains were manufactured in Le Creusot.
On 17 October 1942 the Schneider factory was targeted by the RAF in a daylight raid designated Operation Robinson.


== Transport ==
About 5 km (3.11 mi) south-east of town centre is the Gare du Creusot TGV, a train station on the LGV Sud-Est line, which links the area to Paris, Lyon and beyond with high-speed rail.
