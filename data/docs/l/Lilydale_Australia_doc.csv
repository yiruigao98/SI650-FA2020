== Toponomy ==
Some prefer to believe the town was named after an 1852 song "Lilly Dale" by H. S. Thompson but evidence shows it was named after an early settler, Lilly de Castella.  Most of Victoria has been named after prominent citizens or with traditional Aboriginal names. Lilly de Castella was one of four daughters of Colonel Joseph Anderson and wife Mary. Joseph Anderson was one of eight nominated (non-elected) members of Victoria's first parliament.  Lilly was born Elizabeth Anne on Norfolk Island, where her father was commandant from 1835 to 1839.  Lilly was a typical Victorian pet-name for girls named Elizabeth.  The family settled in South Yarra in 1848 and were friends of Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe and his wife Sophie.  Mary Anderson was a pioneer member of the Melbourne Mechanics Institute.  Colonel Anderson was also a close friend of Crown Surveyor Clement Hodgkinson and was a pallbearer at the funeral of Governor Hotham, who died on 31 December 1855.  Lilly married Paul de Castella in 1856; Colonel Anderson co-owned the couple's Yering Station.  Anderson Street in Lilydale was named after the Colonel, and the parallel Castella Street was named after his son-in-law, Lilly's husband Paul.
