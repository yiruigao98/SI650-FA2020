Lodi ( LOH-dye) is a city in Columbia County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,050 at the 2010 census. Lodi is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area.


== History ==
Isaac Palmer founded the village of Lodi in 1846 in what was then the Pleasant Valley Precinct of the Wisconsin Territory. He named it after Lodi, in Italy. Palmer chose this glaciated valley as the location for the village because of its water power potential. Spring Creek powered a sawmill that year and a grist mill followed in 1850.

== Susie the Duck ==
Susie the Duck has been the town's official mascot since 1948. On Wisconsin Highway 113 in downtown Lodi is a small creek-side park where visitors can buy dried corn from vending machines to feed the wild ducks. The machines have since fallen into disuse. In this area is a small stone basket, inscribed with the name of former Lodi resident Engle Knerzer, and every year a duck builds a nest there. When the first mallard settled in that location in 1948, it was nicknamed "Susie" by the granddaughter of the police chief.There is an annual "Susie the Duck Day" celebration, the highlight of which is the rubber duck race. Participants pay a fee for a small rubber duck. The thousands of ducks are then dumped into the creek where they "race" toward a finish line and prizes are awarded based on order of finish. The day's celebrations also include a parade, activities in Goeres Park, brat stands on Main Street and in Goeres Park, and a beer garden in the park.

=== Airport ===
The Lodi Lakeland Airport (FAA ID 9WN5) is a publicly owned general aviation airport 1-mile (1.6 km) north of the city center. The airport is owned by the town of Lodi and operated by a local organization.


=== Railroad ===
A Wisconsin and Southern (reporting mark WSOR) railroad line runs through town en route north to Baraboo and Reedsburg and south to Dane, Waunakee, and Madison.This section of railroad was formerly the CNW mainline, reached Lodi in 1872 and was fully completed in 1873, and linked Milwaukee and Fond Du Lac, with intercity travel provided in the towns in between by C&NW. Two sets of tracks were originally built, although only one remains today in most locations along this line. It was then briefly owned by Union Pacific Railroad after it merged with CNW in 1995, and a lease was signed in 1996 by Wisconsin and Southern for rights to this trackage included in a Madison-area ex-C&NW trackage deal. The line now runs through Lodi from Madison to Reedsburg, and trains that run along it are recognized as L463. Ex-Union Pacific and ex-Burlington Northern units that now belong to WSOR still occasionally run in the area, although most have been repainted.During the line's early days, Lodi had a depot where trains could refill with water, fuel, receive and deport cargo and passengers, and send telegraphs. The depot and adjacent feed mill have long been demolished, but its foundation and platform still remains between the Church Street grade crossing and the Sauk Street grade crossing, and a barren lot remains where they once stood. The Lodi Canning Company is still capable of cargo shipments consisting mainly of canned vegetables and plant products. The plant's siding has been seen storing track maintenance equipment such as tamping machines and rolling stock.
