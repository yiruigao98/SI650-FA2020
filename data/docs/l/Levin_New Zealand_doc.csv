== History and culture ==


=== 20th century ===
The Levin township was established in 1906.
The town was named after William Hort Levin, a director of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company.The name is a variation of the Jewish clan Levi. It is a shibboleth – unlike the usual pronunciation of the surname, stress is placed on the second syllable of the word. However his great grandson, Peter Levin, claims his forebear would have pronounced his surname as in Levene and this pronunciation was in common use for many years and always used by the family.


=== 21st century ===
The town celebrated its centenary in 2006 and the bowls club celebrated theirs in 2007.
In October 2019, thirty people had to evacuate a public pool after a chemical incident at the local aquatic centre.

Kawiu Marae and Te Huia o Raukura meeting house, located just north of the Levin township, are a meeting place for Muaūpoko.In October 2020, the Government committed $945,445 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Kawiu Marae and nearby Kohuturoa Marae, creating 50 jobs.
