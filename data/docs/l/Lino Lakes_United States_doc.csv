== History ==


=== Settlement ===
When the first settlers arrived, Native Americans were already making their home in the area where Reshanau, Baldwin, Rice and Marshan Lakes cluster. The Dakota people found this to be a land of plenty, with abundant wild rice and small game. Several Indian burial grounds are in the area. White hunters and trappers began coming to the area from both Canada and the eastern states around 1850. Those who settled on the west side of the lake had names like Ramsden, Speiser, and Wenzel. The east side of the lake was settled by families including the Cardinals, LaMottes, Houles and Dupres. Many of their descendants still live in the area. The area's first unit of local government was the township of Centerville, organized on August 11, 1857, and encompassing 36 square miles. The population of just under 300 was organized into three loosely knit communities known as the "German settlement" west of the lakes, the "Swede settlement" south of the lakes, and the "French settlement" east of the lakes. In the 1950s neighboring villages started annexing land away from Centerville Township. To protect the boundaries and allow for the financing of public improvements, the township residents voted to incorporate into a village.


=== Naming ===
Several names were suggested for the new village, most containing the word "lakes". The origin of the word "Lino" is unknown. A Lino post office operated for about 10 years in the late 1800s. The town board decided to name the new village Lino Lakes. On May 11, 1955, the Village of Lino Lakes was incorporated. It covered the original Centerville Township except the Village of Centerville, and comprised 21,000 acres of land and 1,800 citizens. In 1972, the state legislature changed all Minnesota villages to cities, hence Lino Lakes's current status.


== Education ==
Most of the city is served by the Centennial School District, which in 2011 was ranked as having better public schools than 90% of the country and 95% of Minnesota. Lino Lakes Elementary is also in the city, but falls within the adjacent Independent School District 831 in Forest Lake.


== Recreation ==


=== Parks ===
The Lakes Parks and Recreation Department is responsible for the development and maintenance of the parks and trails system. Development of the parks system includes installing playground equipment, and benches, irrigation, landscaping projects. Staff maintains 11 softball/baseball fields, 12 soccer fields and 3 ice rinks as well as approximately 30 miles of trails. The 5,500-acre Rice Creek Chain of Lakes Regional Park Reserve in Lino Lakes is one of the seven-county metropolitan area's largest parks and contains some of the most significant native wildlife habitat and water resources in the region. 


== Controversies ==


=== English Only resolution ===
On July 26, 2010, the Lino Lakes City Council voted 4–1 to establish English as Lino Lakes's official language. The resolution stated that all official documents would be prepared in English and that the city would not pay for translation of its official documents into any other language. Proponents stated that the expenses related to translation of governmental expenses were unnecessary. On the other hand, the resolution has been perceived as connected to the English-only movement. MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce president Lori Higgins said, "it makes the area appear unwelcoming."
