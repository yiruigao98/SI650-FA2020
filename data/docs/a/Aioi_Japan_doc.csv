== History ==

Aioi City was founded on October 1, 1942, and was enlarged to its present size on August 1, 1955. The city's name comes from the name of one of the villages that were merged to create the city. (Curiously, the name of the village was pronounced "Au", but used the same kanji characters as the present-day city.)  During the Edo period, these villages were part of the Akō han (fiefdom of feudal lords) of Harima Province.The main industry in Aioi is shipbuilding, which, despite many years of decline, still maintains a strong presence through Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI).
Aioi is known for the annual dragon boat races held during the Aioi Peron Festival (相生ペーロン祭), which takes place on the last weekend of May each year. In 1655, the dragon boat races were brought from China to Nagasaki. Later in 1922, some Nagasaki IHI workers were transferred to Aioi. They brought the dragon boat races with them.

=== Trains ===
Aioi is well connected with transportation. Aioi has two train stations and several major expressways and roads.
The two train stations in Aioi are: Aioi Station (相生駅) and Nishi-Aioi Station (West Aioi Station) (西相生駅). Two train lines run through Aioi Station: Sanyō line (山陽本線, Sanyō-honsen) and the Akō Line (赤穂線, Akō-sen). The Sanyō line is the main train line running west and east along the Seto Inland Sea (瀬戸内海, Seto Naikai). The Akō line begins in Aioi and runs west through Nishi Aioi Station and Akō City and continues into Okayama Prefecture to Okayama City.
Today, Aioi Station serves as a gateway to Harima Science Garden City, which hosts SPring-8, the largest synchrotron in the world, among other scientifically oriented institutes and companies.

== Daikon ==
On November 2005, the city was mentioned in world news reports after a large daikon radish that grew though the pavement was found slashed.  According to a city spokesperson, the radish was seen as an inspiration due to "its tenacity and strong will to live." The tenacious daikon, nicknamed "Daichan," has since been celebrated in a children's book. In 2006, a special firework representing the daikon was set off at the annual firework display preceding the dragon boat races.
