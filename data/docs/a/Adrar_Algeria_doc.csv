Summer temperatures are consistently high as they commonly approach 40 °C (106 °F). temperatures at night are still hot at around 27 °C (81 °F). Even in early May or in late September, daytime temperatures can rise to 45 °C (113 °F). Adrar experiences the same kind of desert heat as Death Valley, California during summertime. Winter nights can be chilly and frost is by no means unknown but the days are pleasantly warm, sunny and dry. During the summer, the Sahara region of Algeria is the source of a scorching, sometimes dusty and southerly wind called the Sirocco.
