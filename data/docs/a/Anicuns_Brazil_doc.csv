== Origin of the name ==
The name of the city comes from the Guanicuns Indians, who would hunt a bird with the same name (extinct).  The anicuns bird was known for its beautiful feathers and song. The Indians made adornments from the feathers and ate the bird's tongue believing that it would allow them to imitate its beautiful singing.


== History ==
