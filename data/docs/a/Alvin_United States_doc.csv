== History ==
The Alvin area was settled in the mid-19th century when bull ranches were established in the area. The Santa Fe Railroad eventually expanded into the area, and a settlement was established along the railroad. Alvin was originally named "Morgan" by the town's residents in honor of the settlement's original resident, Santa Fe employee Alvin Morgan; upon discovery that the name Morgan had been taken, the town named itself after Morgan's first name. The town was officially incorporated in 1893, making it the oldest incorporated settlement in Brazoria County. Alvin Morgan received a land grant from the state of Texas prior to 1891.
As of 1933, Alvin was a sundown town, where practically no African Americans were allowed to live.On July 25, 1979, Tropical Storm Claudette stalled over Alvin and inundated the region with 45 inches (1,140 mm) of rain in 42 hours. The total included 43 inches (1,090 mm) in 24 hours, at the time the maximum 24-hour rainfall in American history.


== City election history ==
In Alvin's municipal election on May 7, 2016, citizens voted to elect newly relocated resident, Chris Sanger, as their At Large Position 2 city council member in the city's largest turnout in a municipal election, with 1,590 votes cast. Sanger ousted two-term incumbent, Terry Droege, with Sanger receiving 50.58% to Droege's 49.42%. Chris Sanger ran on the slogan, "Fresh Face, New Voice," while pointing out that the incumbent had a spotty attendance record to regularly scheduled council meetings, amongst other calls for accountability, such as lower property taxes, expenditure responsibility, and that police for the city of Alvin have been historically underpaid.Chris Sanger resigned in October 2017, citing a possible conflict of interest between his occupation and his position on city council. Candidate filings began the next month and on March 24, 2018, then 18-year-old Joel Castro won a special election against John Burkey to serve for the remainder of Sanger's unexpired term. The election made Castro, who turned 19 shortly after his victory, the youngest sitting city councilman in the state of Texas. Joel Castro was reelected in 2019 to begin serving his first full term on city council.
