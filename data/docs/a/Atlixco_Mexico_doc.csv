The main portal is decorated with paired columns, spiraling vines in high relief and ornamental sculptures in niches on both the upper and lower levels. The doorway itself is a lobed Moorish arch. The center of this decoration is a niche with an image of the Virgin of Mercy, who shelters Mercedarian founder Pedro Nolasco and other saints with her cloak. The interior was redone in the 19th century, but maintains a large colonial era portrait of Our Lady of Mercy by José Joaquín Magón as well as an 18th-century inlaid wood pulpit.

Above the facade, there is an escutcheon with a relief of the Holy Sacrament and a two-headed Habsburg eagle. On the sides of this are rampant lions and angels in while on an ocher background.

== Geography and environment ==

The territory of the municipality is divided between the Valley of Puebla and the Atlixco Valley, both of which extend from the Sierra Nevada. The altitude varies from a low of 1,700 meters above sea level in the south to 2,500  in the northwest at the foot of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, with an overall average altitude of 1840. The center of the territory is a valley floor that extends from north to south, with isolated mountains such as Zoapiltepec and Texistle in the southeast. Other isolated peaks include the Pochote, Tecuitlacuelo, Loma La Calera and El Charro.The municipality is located in the basin of the Nexapa River, a tributary of the Atoyac. Various streams run through the territory, which have their source at the Iztaccihuatl Volcano; however, most depending on snow melt from the volcano. The Nexcapa is one of the few that run year-round and splits the Atlixco Valley in half. Other larger ones include the Cuescomante, which passes by the seat, the Molino and the Palomas. The highest elevations at the foot of the volcanos are marked by a large number of ravines. The San Pedro Atlixco Waterfall is in this area, surrounded by pines and cedars. This area has fishing, boating, camping and more.The municipality is in the transition zone between the more temperate climates of the north of the state and the hotter climates of the south. The northwest and isolated peaks have a temperate and semi humid climate as it has the highest altitude. The center and south have a warm and semi-humid climate.

Most of the valley floor area is dedicated to irrigated farming, with rainy season farming dominant in the higher elevations. The latter has contributed to extensive deforestation, cutting down pines and cedars. The only remaining wild vegetation is in small areas in the north and northeast, where these trees still exist. In small areas in the southeast, there is pastureland and scrub brush.


== Culture ==
The most important annual event in the municipality is called El Huey Atlixcayotl, a Nahuatl phrase which roughly translates to “the great Atlixco tradition.” This event, started in 1965, is a reinvention of an old indigenous celebration that tradition says in the pre Hispanic period honored the god Quetzalcoatl, giving thanks for the harvest. On the last Saturday of September, the event begins with the selection of the festival queen, called the Xochicihuatl (lit. flower woman) and a dance called Las Canastas, when women dance with baskets of fireworks on their heads. The main events are on the following day, Sunday, when a parade of between 800 and 1,500 participants from Puebla's eleven regions leaves the town square to climb Cerro de San Miguel, which has a stage area with stands. The rest of the day is filled with performances by charros, bands, mojigangas, voladores and more. These activities are in honor of the Archangel Michael, who has a small church on the mountain. In 1996 the event was named as part of the Cultural Heritage of Puebla.

The Festival de la Ilusión (Illusion Festival) was started in the 1990s by two teenagers to reinforce the tradition of Three Kings’ Day in Mexico, January 6.  At that time, many fathers and other family members went to the United States to work, leading to foreign influences such as Santa Claus. To give January 6 precedence, the teens took a collection from local businesses to buy thousands of balloons and envelopes so that children could have a mass launch, sending their requests for toys. The fourth of January is still dedicated to this launch, but two days have been added. On January 5, a 5 km parade with floats in honor of the Three Kings is held, and on January 6 the local convention center hosts musical groups, clowns and other forms of entertainment for the city.The Festival de la Iluminación (Lights Festival)  or Villa Iluminada (Lighted Village) begins on November 20 with large lighted figures that adorn the city's streets. This event was begun in 2010, with the lights placed along a corridor of a km and half. The event draws over 500,000 visitors to the city during the 46 days it is set up from the end of November to the beginning of January. In addition to the lights the event also features amusement rides, and an exhibition of sky lanterns.Some of the annual events are related to Atlixco's economy.

== History ==

The name “Atlixco” comes from a Nahuatl phrase which can be interpreted as either “water in the valley” or “water on the ground.” Its main economic activity has earned the city the suffix of “de las flores” (of the flowers) . The city of Atlixco received its coat of arms from King Phillip II in 1579, which now represents the entire municipality.In the pre  Hispanic period, it was part of Cuauhquecollán, today Huaquechula. The first known inhabitants of this area were the Teochichimecas around 1100CE, before becoming a Xicalanca settlement. This area was eventually conquered by Tenochtitlan. Its location made it a battleground among several indigenous peoples, with the populations of Calpan, Huejotzingo and Cholula claiming possession. After the Conquest it was named Acapetlahuacan (place of reeds) until its current name.During the colonial period, the area was an important producer of grain, especially wheat, giving rise to the first wheat mill in the state.  The city proper was founded in 1579 as Villas de Carrión by Pedro de Castillo, Cristóbal Ruiz de Cabrera and Alonso Díaz de Carrión. Originally it and the surrounding area was under the jurisdiction of Huejotzingo, but in 1632, it became a local independent seat of government.In 1706 the area became under the direct control of the Spanish Crown, with Philip V granting José Sarmiento de Valladares the title of Duque y Señor de Atlixco.In 1840 the Marquesa Calderón de la Barca visited the community and noted that it was filled with beautiful churches, monasteries and other buildings.The town was given the official status of city by Nicolás Bravo in 1843. In 1847, the municipal government took over administration of the San Juan de Dios Hospital. In 1862, troops led by General Tomás O´Horan defeated French sympathizers under Leonardo Márquez, impeding the advance of French troops. This was an important precursor to the Battle of Puebla .Since then the area's economy has changed to the production of flowers and ornamental plants along with some commerce and industry. There have also been efforts to make the area attractive for tourists, with various festivals and other events established since the late 20th century.In 2008, the municipality set a world record for the largest chile en nogada, measuring 2.6 meters by 90 cm.
