Al Sulayyil is in the southern Riyadh region. Along with the nearby city of Wadi ad-Dawasir, these are the main cities of the area which are considered to be one of richest farming areas in the kingdom, although it is very close to the largest continuous sand desert in the world towards the east of the region, named Rub' al Khali.
Sulayyil is mostly inhabited by the people of the Dawasir tribe. The Al Sulayyil ballistic missile base was built in 1987–1988 in the valley 25 km north of the town.
