The name passed on to the whole network because of the location of the first university in the network, the campus "Universidad Anahuac Mexico Norte" located in the area of Lomas Anahuac in Interlomas in Mexico City. Symbolically, the name refers to "the lake region that gave central place at the Aztec capital: Tenochtitlán, Central America's most populous and largest cultural development, where the City of Mexico now stands and in it, the university "

== The bad manage of the Anahuac University and the Covid-19 ==
The Anahuac University, like many educational institutions in the world, suffer the ravages caused by the recent pandemic caused by a coronavirus. In March 2020, the Mexican government headed by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, issued a highly important executive order to initiate a national quarantine as a result of the growing wave of coronavirus infections worldwide, which forced educational institutions to apply a form of online classes, through platforms such as zoom and classroom respectively.
However, the university has been questioned on multiple occasions by teachers, students, parents and anonymous student groups (for fear of academic retaliation), due to the poor quality of the classes and lack of substantial support from the university to the teachers who worked from their homes and taught distance classes, demanding better materials and understanding from the students.
In the middle of June and July, the students of the Anahuac University were on vacation, but worried about the high wave of infections and economic uncertainty that the country was going through, added to the constant erroneous promises of government health authorities. These factors caused a series of doubts among the families of the students, teachers and administrative staff of the institution, regarding the future of their stay at the university, payment of salaries, etc., according to testimonies from the students themselves, the university ruled in the months of June and July with a somewhat varied position since it issued late, inefficient official communications that created even more doubts, so organized student groups sought the support of Dr. Cipriano Sanchez Garcia, LC, rector of the University Anáhuac Norte and Universidad Anáhuac Sur, without success and even obtained little or no support from the institution's student affairs council, in addition some students pointed out that the rector preferred to attend to their social and advertising matters by appearing in capsules of television programs such as: come joy, today and the sun came up, amidst student requests whose central theme was the possibility Theity of reaching an agreement with the university so that a large number of university students would enjoy the possibility of continuing to study, since many depended on family income that was diminished by low business income, layoffs and low economic growth in the country , all as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
The university presented an official statement in which it was specified that due to the demands of the students, the internal conclusion would have been reached (that is, without consulting real demands), if the amount of the credit per subject was not increased and a discount of the 5% to enrollment, which was questioned by teachers, students and various threads in the well-known social network Twitter, considering it a null support compared to the actions that other institutions of the same Network of Anáhuac Universities and institutions of the same size would have carried out .
The null support from the institution forced the students to start a campaign on social networks under the hashtag #ayudameanahuac and #anahuacayudameaestudiar, this time adding other members of the students of the Anáhuac University Network such as Campus Cancún, Mayab and Queretaro. The campaign consisted of taking a photo specifying the reasons why students asked for more meaningful support in order to help them continue with their university career. The campaign had more than 2,000 publications together, on networks such as instagram, facebook and reddit. The university ruled in mid-July with a revision statement specifying that they would have to consult the demands of the students with the general university council, asking for 2 weeks to issue a final resolution.
On July 25, the university issued the resolution statement without moving the previous stance, which many qualified only as a mechanism of the same institution to only create time before students had to assign schedules for their next semester, forcing to students to make more uncertain decisions and putting their family's assets at risk with the promise of continuing to study and even forced many to stop studying. The university ended up being massively criticized by the student and teaching community since they also received a 15% reduction in payment for their services.
In addition, a select group of students indicated that the university would have significant savings in managing its current expenses (electricity, water, maintenance), since there is no real use of the facilities and its expenses would be reduced to significant levels, reason enough for the students to express their anger, pointing out the lack of empathy and solidarity of the institution. So far neither the rector nor the university has made a statement regarding these actions.
