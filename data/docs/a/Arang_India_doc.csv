The period horror-romance is based on the folklore of Arang, who died unjustly and returns as a ghost in order to reveal the circumstances surrounding her death.

== Synopsis ==
A nobleman named Kim Eun-oh (Lee Joon-gi) comes to town searching for his mother after hearing a rumor that she is staying at the village of Miryang. He has the special ability to hear, see and touch spirits, but pretends he doesn't because he gets annoyed when they pester him to help them.
A-rang (Shin Min-ah) lost all her memories when she became a ghost and is unable to rest in peace until she finds out how she died. After appearing to three magistrates, none of them survive the fright of seeing her. Some local officials, desperate over the fact that no one wanted to take up the position for so long, coerce Eun-oh into becoming the new magistrate. When she finds out that Eun-oh is able to see her and that he appointed as the new magistrate, she begs for his help.
At first, Eun-oh rejects her request. However, he changes his mind after seeing that A-rang somehow has a distinctive hairpin that he gave his mother at their last meeting. He believes that if he helps her, Arang will regain her memories and give him information about his mother. He exasperatedly (then affectionately) nicknames her “Amnesia”. As the town's newly installed magistrate, he teams up with her to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death, which may involve the mysterious nobleman Joo-wal. Along the way, they must prevent Arang from being captured by Mu-young, the leader of the local grim reapers. Eun-oh also uncovers a long history of corruption by a local nobleman and decides to use his new position as magistrate to bring justice and order.
Arang and Eun-oh's actions, meanwhile, are being tracked by the Jade Emperor and Yeom-ra themselves, who fear that events in Miryang are much more horrifying than they appear.

== Background ==
The drama is based on famous folklore, as most ghost stories are: During the Joseon era in the city of Miryang, Arang was the pure, beautiful, goodhearted daughter of a magistrate. She grew up without a mother and was raised by a wicked caretaker who conspired to have her raped and ruined by a servant, Baekga. He attacked and she resisted, so he stabbed and killed her, and left her body to rot in the woods. Her father, the magistrate, just believed that she dishonorably eloped with a man and so resigned his position swathed in shame. Thus the legend goes that every time a new magistrate comes to Miryang to fill the position, Arang's vengeful ghost shows up to tell him her story and he flees in terror. But one day a new magistrate comes to town — a young man by the name of Lee Sang-sa. Arang appears to him like every other magistrate before him, but this man doesn't flee, and instead sympathizes with Arang, and promises to find her killer and avenge her death. Lee Sang-sa has Baekga seized and executed, and thereafter, Arang's spirit ceased to trouble the town.
