Albano Laziale (IPA: [alˈbaːno latˈtsjaːle], Latin: Albanum, Romanesco: Arbano) is a comune in the Metropolitan City of Rome, on the Alban Hills,  in Latium, central Italy.  Rome is 25 kilometres (16 mi) distant. It is bounded by other communes of Castel Gandolfo, Rocca di Papa, Ariccia and Ardea. Located in the Castelli Romani area of Lazio. It is sometimes known simply as Albano.
Albano is one of the most important municipalities of the Castelli Romani, and a busy commercial centre. It has been also a suburbicarian bishopric since the 5th century, a historic principality of the Savelli family, and from 1699 to 1798 the inalienable possession of the Holy See. It now houses, among other things, the Praetor of the district court of Velletri.  The territory of Albano is partially included in the Parco Regionale dei Castelli Romani.


== Geography ==


=== Territory ===

The territory of Albano Laziale is 23.80 square kilometres (9.19 sq mi) and one of the largest of Colli Albani;  sixth after Velletri at 112.21 square kilometres (43.32 sq mi), Lanuvio at 43.91 square kilometres (16.95 sq mi), Rocca di Papa at 40.18 square kilometres (15.51 sq mi), Rocca Priora at 28.07 square kilometres (10.84 sq mi) and Marino at 26.10 square kilometres (10.08 sq mi). According to the classification given by the Geological Survey of Italy most of the territory is similar to other areas of the Colli Albani, from lands classified as v 2.


==== Hydrography ====
The main hydrographic feature is Lake Albano, whose full name is actually Lake Albano and Castel Gandolfo.  In fact, most coastal lakes are relevant to the town of Castel Gandolfo, while the remainder are in the Albanense  territory. The lake basin is run by the Metropolitan City of Rome.
Some small streams, often dry, start from the north:

Fosso of Santa Palomba, originates from springs from the hills of the Colli Albani area of the old town, and flows westwards to the town of Santa Palomba, in the municipality of Rome and Pomezia.
Fosso of Chancellor, originates from springs from the Chancellor resort, in Ariccia common, about 118 metres (387 ft) above sea level, and continues to flow in a south-south-west to the Tyrrhenian Sea.
Fosso di Valle Caia, originates from the Quarto Negroni, bordering with the municipality of Ariccia at 7 kilometres (4 mi) of National Road 207 Nettunense and continues its path towards the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west.
Fosso di Montagnano; originates from drain water that is collected in the local mountains, between the towns of Albano, Ariccia and Ardea, and continues to the arm for the west the Tyrrhenian Sea.


==== Topography ====

The highest peak of the town of Albano is the Colle dei Cappuccini, located at 615 m above sea level.  From the hill, which houses a pine forest adjacent to the Capuchin Monastery, there is a remarkable overview of Lake Albano, Agro Romano and Monte Cavo.
The historic center of Albano has a maximum gradient of 11%, or 47 metres, 435, taking into consideration the distance between the Cathedral of San Pancrazio (384 m asl) and the St. Paul's Church (431 m asl). Other altitudes through the center of town are Villa Altieri, at kilometre 25 of the State Road 7 Via Appia (363 m asl) and the Church of Stella (391 m asl).
The hill town of Castel Savelli is 280 m above sea level, while the underlying fraction of Pavona is built at 110 m above sea level.  The village of Cecchina at the railway station is located at 212 m above sea level.


=== Climate ===
In terms of climate, the area falls within the domain of the temperate Mediterranean climate with mild winters, with temperatures higher than those autumnal spring, summer breezes.  In the area of Colli Albani, so even at Albano, presents the phenomenon called TSUE, which is the reduction of water vapour in the clouds as the ground rises.  So there will be more rainfall on the foothills of the hills, facing the sea, south southwest, and to the north.  Albano, lying on the trajectory of the current wet Tyrrhenian, is fairly rainy with 900–1000 mm annual precipitation.   The winds blow mainly from the south and west, more rarely from the north and east. Summer is hot and dry, with a mild and rainy winter with snow quite rarely and only in the presence of a marked generalised cold.  In summer, temperatures can reach 35 °C (95 °F) with peaks of 37 °C (99 °F) in rare cases.  The temperature never reached 40 °C (104 °F).


== Etymology ==

The name Albano is still a source of debate. In Roman times, the territory of Latium was called Albanum: Albanum (Pompeians Domitiani, etc.).The estate of the wealthy Romans on the Colli Albani (Ager Albanus) and Castra Albana was the name of the camp built by Septimius Severus, within the confines of the fund Albanum previously owned by Domitian, to accommodate the Legio II Parthica.  This place-name hypothesis is considered the most reliable as the root of these ties in Indo-European * alb / * alp indicating a high location, the Mons Albanus (now Monte Cavo) in this case, while it was the centre of worship and common pasture (compascuo).  Other assumptions, however, considered valid are the Latin place-name adjective albus (“white") or Greek αλαβα (“ash").  Etymologically proposed Albanum / Castra Albana is the same as being proposed for Alba Longa, whose location is not known with certainty, but placed in a medieval tradition of urban core areas of modern Albano Laziale .  The second part of the Latium name of was used in 1873 to distinguish the city from  Albano Sant'Alessandro (Bergamo), Albano Vercellese (Vercelli province) and Albano di Lucania (Potenza province).


== History ==


=== Ancient age ===
The first recorded evidence of human settlement in the town of Albano Laziale  dates from the beginning of the first millennium BC with the remains of settlements of Tor Paluzzi, Castel Savelli and Colle dei Cappuccini. The human presence in these locations, is maintained even in later times, while from Laziale IIB period (830 BCE – 730 BCE) start to appear due to traces of the mythical foundation Latin capital of Alba Longa.
Most modern historians  seems inclined to place the site of Alba Longa in between the towns of Marino, Rocca di Papa and Ariccia on the eastern side of Lake Albano, which is opposite to the present city of Albano.

Albano is located in the area in which, according to the legend, Aeneas's son, Ascanius, founded Alba Longa. Today the coat of arms of Albano still sports the white (Latin: Alba) boar dreamed of by Ascanius before the founding of the city. Alba Longa was one of the main cities of the Latins and, again according to the legend, the birthplace of Romulus and Remus, the mythical founders of Rome.
Albanense in the territory, were then subjected to a large extent the wealthy of Aricia, which built several suburban villas built by the leading exponents of the Roman nobility. Pompey had a villa, the Albanum Pompeii, whose ruins have been found inside of the Villa Doria Pamphili. A villa belonging to the Seneca would be identified within the ruins found on the south ridge of Lake Albano, bordering the town of Ariccia. All of these residences, at the time of Emperor Domitian were combined into a single fund owned by the Emperor's Albanum Cesaris, within which erected a monumental imperial residence, with the ruins mostly contained in the Villa Barberini at Castel Gandolfo. The Emperor Septimius Severus around 202 had installed in place of the old town of the Legio II Parthica. Thus were born the Castra Albana, which were huge camps that remained in operation until the end of 3rd century. Albano developed from this settlement, as is shown by the main streets, which still follow the ancient decumanus and cardo. Remains of the large baths built by Septimius' son, Caracalla, are still visible.


=== Middle Ages and early Modern era (476–1699) ===

In 326, Emperor Constantine I, according to an established tradition, ordered the founding of the Albanense cathedral dedicated to St. John the Baptist. According to sources, Constantine donated to the newly formed cathedral, various sacred vessels and several estates and funds in Ager Albanus. During the Gothic War, Albano was reduced from municipium to oppidulum, a small fortified city.In 964, Emperor Otto I conferred the investiture at Albano to Virginio Savelli, his captain in Rome. Pope Paschal II in 1118 took refuge in Albano as a hostile insurgency occupied Rome, and found that Albanensi loyalty be granted perpetual exemption from taxes of milling wheat.During the schism of anti-pope Anacletus with Pope Innocent II in 1137 the  anti-pope marched on Lazio Albano and other locations to extend its domain, but these territories were taken over by Innocent II. In the Year 1142, Albano was sacked by the Saracens.
After the Battle of Monte Porzio, in 1168, the Roman people thought it well to take revenge on Albano, who had sided with the city 's Emperor Frederick Barbarossa against Rome, and so the town was looted and razed. Given the state of abandonment, Pope Innocent III gave the monastery of St. Paul Outside the Walls the Palatium with the churches of Santa Maria Minor and St. Nicholas and their dependencies. In 1436 it was razed along with Castel Savelli by Cardinal Giovanni Maria Vitelleschi, by order of Pope Eugenius IV. In 1697 Albano switched to direct control of the Holy See.


=== Feudal era (1699–1798) ===
Pope Pius VI in 1780 began the rearrangement of the Via Appia, to achieve a fast link between Rome and Terracina, where there was intense work on the reclamation of the Pontine Marshes. The first route of the new "National Road" arrived to follow the Via Appia Antica, only to stray from the path along the ridge of ancient Vallericcia to arrive at Genzano, avoiding the sharp uphill to reach Ariccia. Only with the construction of the Ariccia bridge under the pontificates of Pope Gregory XVI and Pius IX (1839–1849) will outline the current route of State Road 7 Via Appia. The opening of the new route of the Via Appia undoubted benefited Albano and locations along its course.
During the first French occupation and the events tied to the French Revolution in the Papal States, on February 18, 1798 Albano, along with Frascati, Velletri and later Marino, proclaimed itself a "sister republic" to the nascent Roman Republic. Following the uprising the Albanensi rebelled against the French, Albano was occupied and looted by the troops of Murat. The following year, however, at Albano, installs Fra Diavolo, commanding Neapolitan column.


=== Contemporary era (1798–1944) ===

With the motu proprio of July 6, 1816, by Pope Pius VI elevated Albano back in the Papal States with the Restoration of the Government seat.
In 1870 Albano became part of the Kingdom of Italy. It became the seat of the district court, by merging the offices of Marino.
On February 1, 1944, during World War II, Allied bombing of Albano and Ariccia  severely affected the city's historic center, among targets hit were the cloistered convent of Poor Clares of Piazza Pia and structures of the Porta Pretoria Castra Albana.
On the morning of Sunday September 21, 2008 Pope Benedict XVI travelled to Albano on a pastoral visit, starting from the Pontifical Villas of Castel Gandolfo, with the opportunity to re-consecrate the Basilica Cathedral of St. Pancras after the restorations of 2008.

=== Military architecture ===
Walls and gates. The fortification of the old town of Albano was now almost completely dismantled at the end of the 18th century for the enlargement of Via Appia. At the time of the Gothic War (535-554), Albano was an oppidulum, then a small fortified settlement. Presumably, the fortifications suffered the vicissitudes of the various destruction and subsequent rebuilding of the city. The complex was the originally fortified Savelli palace, dates back to the 13th century.  Portals in the fortification retain much historical and ornamental significance:
Porta Romana or Porta di San Rocco is situated on the Via Appia towards Rome, flanked by the Doria palace and the church of San Rocco, the final appearance was given in the 18th century.

=== Archaeological sites ===
The Castra Albana contains one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Rome in the Castelli Romani. It consists basically of a few major monuments, dating in general to the time of Septimius Severus:

Santuario di Santa Maria della Rotonda, built probably as a garden nympheum at the Villa of Domitian at Castel Gandolfo, was later incorporated in the complex of Castra Albana by Septimius Severus and eventually became, around the 7th century, a Christian shrine. Similar to the Pantheon of Rome but reduced in scale, it is now preserved after the restoration erased the Baroque changes.

The old building was transformed into a stronghold in medieval times and later occupied by civilians.
The Amphitheater of Albano is the only pattern found in the Castelli Romani belonging to or even pre-existing Castra Albana. It was the place of martyrdom for Christians, as might be inferred from two small Christian chapels, painted in the niches of vomitoria.
