Algemesí (Valencian pronunciation: [aʎdʒemeˈzi]) is a municipality in the comarca of Ribera Alta in the Valencian Community, Spain.
The town of Algemesí is one of the major centres for the production of citruses in Spain, and several cooperatives are based there. This is due to the mild climate and good irrigation coming from the Xuquer river, which passes through the city.
Every September is celebrated the Festivity of “la Mare de Déu de la Salut”, declared as Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2011. The traditional Valencian dance called Muixeranga is originally a part of the festivity.

=== Events ===
La Mare de Déu de la Salut Festival” The Festivity of “la Mare de Déu de la Salut” presents a series of traditions which from 1247 through to 1905 (date of the most recent addition), were transmitted from generation to generation until they came to form what can now be considered a homage to cultural tradition. This event takes place in the historical parts of the city of Algemesí on the 7th and 8 September each year. Of special note is the great participation and involvement of the townsfolk of all ages in the event, through the many associations formed to meet the needs of the traditions and ritual acts that make up the festivity. The guilds, from which the age-old dances were born, underwent many changes with the industrial revolution in the late 19th century, providing their members with a window onto other social and professional environments. These days, the ritual acts and traditions which call for a specific number of participants all have waiting lists. Positions on these lists are hereditary. The number of people joining in the dances which are open to any number of participants is growing constantly.
