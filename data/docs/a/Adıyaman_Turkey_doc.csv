== Politics ==
Until the 1950s, Adıyaman was a city in the province of Malatya. It was made into a province in its own right, on 1 December 1954, as a reward for voting for the winning Democratic Party in the 1954 general election.Adıyaman has since proved relatively high vote shares for Islamist politician, Necmettin Erbakan. His movement (then, the National Salvation Party) scored a landmark 15% there in 1973 a few years after its modest beginning, and his score went on to gradually increase. After being damaged by the military coup in 1980, Erbakan's party (which had become the Welfare Party) came back to win the province with 29.24% and 27% in 1994 and 1999, respectively.Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's AKP won the 2004 local elections with 39.21%.
