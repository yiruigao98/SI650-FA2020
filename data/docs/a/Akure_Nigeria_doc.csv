== History ==


=== Pre 1914 ===
Rock engravings dating back to the Mesolithic period, have been discovered on the outskirts of Akure. Also the oldest Homo sapiens fossil ever found in West Africa thus far was discovered there, dating back to around 11,000 years ago.
Oral tradition states that Akure was founded by Omoremilekun Omoluabi, a great-grandson of the Emperor Oduduwa. The Prince left Ile-Ife, his great-grandfather's kingdom, in search of a place to settle after passing a strict test administered by Oduduwa himself, and eventually founded the city upon his arrival in the Akure region.
The Oba's Palace is located at the centre of the town, and was built in 1150 AD.
It has over 15 courtyards, with each having its unique purpose. Ua nla, Ua Ibura, Ua jemifohun, Ua Ikomo are some of the names of the courtyards. For example, in the Ua ubura courtyard, oaths are taken, and the ua Ikomo is used for naming ceremonies. At present, a bigger and more modern palace is being built to the south of the old palace's grounds. Oja Oba, which means the Oba's Market, is just a stone's throw away from the Palace.
Akure's King is known as the Deji of Akure and is supported by six (6) high chiefs (Iwarefa) in his or her domain. The totem of Akure is the Leopard and the father of Omoremilekun Omoluabi was himself called Ekun (this was his regnal name). It is for this reason that every descendant of the Akure clan has been addressed by outsiders as Omo Ekun during the recitation of his or her praise poetry or, alternatively, as 'Omo Akure Oloyemekun', since Omoremilekun was said to have stayed for a while at Igbo Ooye before coming to the region that would become his kingdom.


=== 1914 - present ===
In 1915, the colonial government merged the divisions of Owo, Ondo and Ekiti to form a new province with headquarters in Akure. In 1976, the town became the capital of Ondo State.
Adebiyi Adegboye Adesida Afunbiowo II was chosen as the Deji of Akure on 13 August 2010 to succeed the previous Oba Oluwadamilare Adeshina, who had been dethroned on 10 June 2010 for sacrilegious misdeeds.  Afunbiowo's daughter, the Omoba Adetutu, was appointed princess regent following his demise on the 30th of November, 2013.
In 2015, Omoba Kola Aladetoyinbo successfully emerged the new monarch of Akure after beating twelve other contestants nominated by the Osupa ruling house to become the 47th Deji of Akure.
