Azua de Compostela, also known simply as Azua, is a municipality (municipio) and capital of Azua Province in the Dominican Republic. Founded in 1504, Azua is one of the oldest European settlements in the Americas. The town is located 100 kilometres west of the national capital, Santo Domingo.


== History ==
The territory was part of the chiefdom of Maguana, one of the five Taino chiefdoms in the island. Christopher Columbus encountered great difficulties that forced him and his companions to take refuge in the Bay of Ocoa, in the eastern part of the Azua territory. There he met the resistance of the Great (Cacique) of Azua Cuyocagua, whom the Admiral tried to subdue without success.
The town of Azúa de Compostela was officially founded in 1504 by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar (conqueror of Cuba), during the government of Don Nicolás de Ovando. The famous conqueror of Mexico Hernán Cortés also resided in the town for several years (1504-1511). During his stay in Azua he used to spend his hours of leisure on the Monte Río beach.


== Economy ==
Azua has an active population (of working age) of 23,242 people of which 16,167 work, 69% of the economically active population. Of those who work, 20% are public servants (3,232 people). Most of the area of the municipality is concentrated in medium-sized properties, in which combined technology is used, with a predominance of mechanization. Large properties, with more than 800 tasks (one task = 628.83 m²), are in the hands of a few large producers.
The municipality has been one of the most benefited with the installation of agro-industrial companies covered by Law 409, which has stimulated the development of the public and private financial sector.
