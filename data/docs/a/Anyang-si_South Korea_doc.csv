Anyang (Korean pronunciation: [a.njaŋ]) is a city in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. With a population of approximately 600,000 persons, it is the 20th largest city in South Korea. It is a satellite city of Seoul and located approximately 21 km (13 mi) south of Seoul, and 19 km (12 mi) north of Suwon. It is connected to Seoul via the Seoul Subway Line 1 and Line 4. The City motto of Anyang is "Livable city, Proud citizens". City symbols are a grape mascot named 'Podong-i', Forsythia (flower), Ginkgo (tree), and eagles.The 'Emblem of Anyang' consists of several different meanings. The blue color represents peace and stable life of its citizens, the white color represents "purity of the white clad folk", the white circle represents "shining sun" and "citizen unity", the interweaving lines represent "industrial and scientific development", "famous mountains around the city" and "tourist resort". Together, the four different symbols mean modern development and cultural exchange. The current mayor of Anyang is Lee Phil Woon.


== Geography ==
Anyang is divided into two-halves for administrative purposes: the Manan district to the west and Dongan district to the east. The Manan district is an old and original downtown area centered on Anyang Station. It is dominated by a shopping area with outdoor markets, known as "ilbeonga" (first street). The Dongan district is a new, wealthy suburb of Pyeongchon. The tallest building in Anyang is the Acro Tower, which was completed in April 2007. It is a twin-tower office building in the Dongan district, across the street from Anyang City Hall. Anyang is a convenient transportation center between Seoul and other major cities across the country.
Anyang spans 58.46 square kilometres (22.57 sq mi). Forest and fields constitute 30.15 km2 (11.64 sq mi), urban development constitutes 11.51 km2 (4.44 sq mi), dry fields constitute 1.8 km2 (0.69 sq mi), rice paddies constitutes 1.25 km2 (0.48 sq mi), and other land use constitutes 13.76 km2 (5.31 sq mi). Anyang is surrounded by mountains on all four sides. These mountains are Gwanak Mountain and Samsung Mountain to the north, Suri Mountain to the southwest, and Cheongye Mountain and Morak Mountain to the other sides. There are eight streams and rivers in Anyang, with a length of 34 kilometres (21 mi).
The main river is Anyang River (one of the four main tributaries of the Han River in Seoul), which is 32.2 km (20.0 mi) long. It has a basin area of 275 km2 (106 sq mi), fed by 21 tributaries. The center of the overall elliptical basin topography is low and flat. The river runs through the center of Anyang city and is a common place for people to walk, jog, or ride bikes. The river flows through seven cities in Gyeonggi Province. This, however, has caused major issues with pollution. River banks are often covered with parking lots or athletic fields, combined with poor sewerage systems in the upper reaches of the river. As a result, the Anyang Stream Watershed Management Committee for Water Quality Improvement had been established to address some of these issues. Between 1974 and 1977, Samduck paper and Samyoung hardboard factories poured industrial waste into the Suam and Samseong Rivers (two of the tributaries of Anyang River), causing the rivers to become toxic. This pollution was serious, and local residents dug pools to collect the industrial waste, producing a large, damp paper slab at the base of the pools. Local elder women citizens cut out the paper slabs into blocks that were sold back to Samduck; the remaining residues from the drying process were kept and used as fire fuel by the residents during winter. The "owner of Samduck recently donated his factory ground to the city as a gesture of compensation to the citizens of Anyang". In November 2008, the site reopened as a city park.


== Climate ==
Anyang is very cold and dry in winter and hot and humid in summer. However, Anyang is cooler than Seoul in summer. The average annual temperature is 12.3c, while the average rainfall is 1,344mm. Around two-thirds of Anyang's rainfall occurs during monsoon season between June and August.


== History ==
The name Anyang originates from Anyang mall which was established by Wang Geon, the First Emperor of the Goryeo dynasty. In the fourth year of Hyōgong, king of Silla (900), Wang Geon, a general of Gung Ye, was passing through Samsung Mountain to quell the rebellion in the Gumju (Siheung) and Gwaju (Gwacheon) areas. During their travels, the troops met an old Buddhist priest named Neungjung, and while listening to the priest, Wang Geon had the idea of building a temple at the location. Anyang itself is a Buddhist term signifying a heavenly land where unimaginable joy and freedom overflow.As with most towns and cities in South Korea, Anyang has experienced tremendous urban growth during the past few decades. Anyang was severely battered by warfare during the Korean War. Ten years after it ended, the area's population was still largely rural and its landscape agricultural. It was well known for its grape growing. Anyang was given city status in 1973 and has grown to become the 15th most populated city in the country. It is also becoming a commuter city for many workers in Seoul because of its close proximity.
