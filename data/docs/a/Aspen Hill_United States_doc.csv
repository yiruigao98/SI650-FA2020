Aspen Hill is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States.


== Etymology ==
The community name is derived from aspen trees that once were found near the first post office in the area. The post office was located in a general store on what was then known as the Washington-Brookeville Pike (now the intersection of Connecticut and Georgia Avenues) and opened circa 1864.


== History ==
In the 1920s and 1930s, Aspen Hill was known as being the location of Aspin Hill Memorial Park, one of three pet cemeteries then operating on the East Coast of the United States. Burials at Aspen Hill Cemetery included dogs that had served the during World War I as well as the pets of area residents. Memorial ceremonies honoring pets were often held there on World Day for Animals.In July 1950, Louis M. Denit sold 517 acres (2.1 km2) of land in Aspen Hill to Gelman Construction Company for approximately $300,000. Denit was a well-known attorney who specialized in banking and trust law. Gelman Construction Company bought the land in order to build 2,450 three-bedroom ramblers, a shopping center, schools, playgrounds, and churches. The homes were priced at less $10,000 each.In January 1955, Minnie Goodman sold 268 acres (1.1 km2) of land in Aspen Hill to Metropolitan Homes, Inc. At the time, the land was the last vacant tract of land of its size between Rockville and Wheaton. Metropolitan Homes planned to build 12,000 homes, schools, shopping centers, and churches on the land. Prices for the homes started at $15,000 each.Aspen Hill was one of the locations in which a fatal shooting took place in October 2002 as part of the Beltway sniper attacks.


== Geography ==
As a census-designated place, Aspen Hill's boundaries are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. The United States Postal Service does not accept “Aspen Hill” as a place name; addresses in the community must use the place names Rockville, Silver Spring, or Wheaton.Some addresses use Wheaton (20906), notably in the Aspen Hill Shopping Center, while immediately across Aspen Hill Road at the Northgate Plaza Shopping Center, the addresses use Silver Spring (20906). Immediately to the west across Connecticut Avenue, addresses use Rockville (20853). As a result, crime statistics which are reasonably considered as belonging to Aspen Hill are buried in the statistics of three different areas. Aspen Hill straddles a corner where three statistical areas meet in what locals consider the commercial heart of Aspen Hill.
The United States Census Bureau, defines Aspen Hill as a census-designated place located at 39°6' North, 77°5' West. In the 2000 Census Bureau Gazetteer, Aspen Hill was located at 39°5′19″N 77°4′49″W (39.088525, −77.080267).The United States Geological Survey definition of Aspen Hill is centered at 39°4′46″N 77°4′24″W, somewhat different from either of the Census Bureau's definitions.
Other organizations, such as the Aspen Hill Civic Association, Inc., have their own definitions. The organizational membership bounds of the Civic Association do not include any areas to the east of Georgia Avenue. The community organization, Aspen Hill Group, on the other hand, only represents and consists of homeowners from the neighborhoods of Aspen Hill Road, Parkland, Arctic Avenue, and Frankfort/Mariana. Other local resources such as the Montgomery Gazette and the Washington Post use a more broad definition. Generally speaking, if it is not a part of Manor Country Club or Leisure World, and is south of Norbeck Road and north of Veirs Mill Road, east of Rock Creek and west of Bel Pre Creek or Matthew Henson State Park or Matthew Henson Greenway, the local media consider it to be Aspen Hill.
