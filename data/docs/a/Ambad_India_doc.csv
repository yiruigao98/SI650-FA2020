Ambad is a town with a municipal council in Jalna district  in the state of Maharashtra, India. Ambad is notable for its temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Matsyodari. In October of each year, devotees of the goddess gather in Ambad for the Hindu festival of Dashahara. A local tradition claims that the name "Ambad" was given to this city by a Hindu Raja named Ambarisha. According to this tradition, Raja Ambarisha would worship the goddess on a rock hill which resembled a fish. Because of this fish-shaped rock hill, the goddess was named Matsyodari ("in the stomach of fish").  The temple was constructed by Ahilya Devi Holkar, who also has developed Ambad by constructing Pushkarini and Kavandi (water reservoirs). Ambad is the second most populous town in district of Jalna. Ambad also has a Government Polytechnic College which is one of the only two Government Polytechnic Colleges located in Jalna district along with Government Polytechnic, Jalna. Ambad municipal council is convened at Court Road.
Ambad is also famous for its "Dattajayanti Sangeet Mahotsav" celebrations. The festival was started in 1923 by Pandit Bappasaheb Jalgaonkar. His son the Pandit Govindrao Jalgaonkar continued the tradition and gave it a broader appeal among masses. The festival is purely based on Indian classical music.
