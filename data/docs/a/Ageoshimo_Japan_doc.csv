== History ==
Ageo-shuku, a post town on the Nakasendō highway flourished during the Edo period. 
Ageo's rail station opened in 1883. In 1889, Ageo-juku merged with the hamlets of Ageoshimo, Kashiwaza, Kasugayatsu and Yatsu to form the town of Ageo with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The two towns of Hirakata and Haraichi and the three villages of Kamihira, Ōishi and Ōya merged with the town of Ageo on January 1, 1955, which was elevated city status on July 15, 1958. A proposal to merge with the neighboring city of Saitama was rejected by referendum in 2001.

Ageo was a noted agricultural area well into the 20th century.  In the second half of the 20th century, numerous metallurgical and automobile factories were constructed, and UD Trucks and Bridgestone Cycle remain major employers. Due to its geographic location, Ageo is increasingly becoming a bedroom community for Saitama City and Tokyo.
