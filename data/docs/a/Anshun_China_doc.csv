== History ==
During the Warring States Period, the area belonged to the independent kingdom of Yelang. The Records of the Grand Historian states that of all the independent kingdoms in the area, Yelang was the largest. The kingdom was located along Zangke River (now called Beipan River), and Nanpan River. Bamboo Worship, Cow Totems, bullfights and dogfights were the culture traditions of the Yelang Empire. In 111 BCE, Yelang was conquered by the Han Dynasty, and incorporated as Zangke Commandery. From 28 BCE to 25 BCE, an insurrection against Emperor Cheng called for the reinstatement of the Yelang Kingdom, but was crushed by Han forces.In the Three Kingdoms Period, the area was split between the county of Yelang and the county of Qielan within Yi Province.Under the Jin Dynasty, the area of present-day Anshun would fall under the jurisdiction of Guangtan County (廣談縣) within Yi Province.During the Sui Dynasty, the area belonged to Binhua County (宾化縣), located within Zangke Commandery, Zang Province.This organization of the region remained intact until the latter portion of the Tang Dynasty, when it was re-organized under the Puning Commandery.
