== Syrian Civil War ==

On October 3, 2012, Akçakale was hit by shells from across the Syrian border in Tell Abyad, killing five civilians. In October 2014, there was an Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant presence in the town, due to the porous nature of the border at that time between Akçakale and Tell Abyad, which was then part of the Islamic State. When Tell Abyad was taken by the Kurdish-majority People's Protection Units in June 2015, the Turkish government then closed the border.
