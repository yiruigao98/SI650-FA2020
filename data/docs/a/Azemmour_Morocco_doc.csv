Azemmour or Azammur (Arabic: أزمور‎, romanized: azammūr; Berber languages: ⴰⵣⵎⵎⵓⵔ, romanized: azemmur, lit. 'wild olive tree') is a Moroccan city, lying at the Atlantic ocean coast, on the left bank of the Oum Er-Rbia River, 75 km southwest of Casablanca.


== Etymology ==
The word Azemmour comes from the Berber word Azemmur ("wild olive tree").


== History ==
Azemmour is generally identified as the Punic Azama, latinized as Asama.Before 1486, it was a dependency of the King of Fez. In 1486 its inhabitants became vassals and tributaries of João II of Portugal.In 1513 Azemmour's governor Moulay Zayam refused to pay the tribute and mustered a powerful, well-equipped army. Manuel responded to this challenge by sending a massive fleet of 500 ships and 15 thousand soldiers (Bergreen, 19).  James, Duke of Braganza led this army and on  September 1st  he conquered the city with no resistance from its inhabitants. Ferdinand Magellan, the man famed for leading the first-ever circumnavigation of the earth, was among the Portuguese soldiers there; he lost his horse in skirmishes outside the city. Portuguese control of the city lasted only for a short period; it was abandoned by João III of Portugal in 1541 due to his court's economic difficulties.
