== Overview ==
Aweil is the capital city of Northern Bahr el Ghazal. It is also the county seat of Aweil Centre County. The city's infrastructure is relatively developed. Aweil now has a functioning railway station, hotel, airport, soccer stadium, and a public hospital. The city functions as a team site for the United Nations Mission in South Sudan. Several NGOs providing aid in South Sudan are based here.
The topography is flat and is prone to flooding, although the city itself lies on higher ground that the surrounding plains. The city lies close to the confluence of the Lol River with the Pongo River. The average elevation of the city of Aweil is about 425 metres (1,394 ft) above sea level.  During the rainy season, the plain-dwellers seek refuge on higher ground in the city of Aweil.
Socially and economically vibrant, Aweil is one of the most peaceful cities within South Sudan's Ten States. Peace within the region has provided an economic boost, secondly most Aweilians remain unaffected by political decision making, they no longer have issues with cattle raiding and ethnic or tribal violence.


== Demographic ==
The population of the Aweil city fluctuates. During the dry season, the population is lower as the plain-dwellers return to the plains to tend to their gardens and harvest their crops. When the rains  come and the plains flood, they return to the city, to escape the raging waters. In November 2008, Médecins Sans Frontières estimated the town's population at about 100,000, but there is no verified population figure.

The railway passes through Aweil South County to Wau. Aweil is served by Aweil Airport to Juba. In 2012 the local airline stopped flying.
