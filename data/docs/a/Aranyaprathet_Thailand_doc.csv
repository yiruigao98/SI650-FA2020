Aranyaprathet (Thai: อรัญประเทศ) is a town (thesaban mueang) in Sa Kaeo Province in eastern Thailand . It covers the entire tambon of Aranyaprathet, in Aranyaprathet District. As of 2005, the town has 16,937 inhabitants. It is located just 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the border with Cambodia; the town of Poipet is on the other side of the border. On the Thai side of the border is the huge Rongkluea market. Cambodian people cross the border daily with pushcarts and scooters with side cars loaded with their products. A significant part of the trade is in second hand clothes. Just over the border on the Cambodian side there are casinos. These are visited by many Thai people because gambling is prohibited in Thailand. Special free buses run between Bangkok and these casinos. Cambodians themselves are not allowed to gamble in these border casinos.
