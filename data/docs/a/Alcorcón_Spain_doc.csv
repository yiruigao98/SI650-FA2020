The first recorded written reference to Alcorcón is in a court document (privilegio rodado) dated on 28 July 1208, in the context of the territorial strife over El Real de Manzanares between the city councils of Madrid and Segovia that took place in the Middle Ages. The parish church of Santa María la Blanca dates back to the 16th and 17th centuries. Alcorcón preserved an urban structure characteristic of a small rural settlement until the 1960s. The centre is surrounded by modern developments, as Alcorcón has grown rapidly since that decade.
