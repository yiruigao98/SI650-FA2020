The PreK-5 school was built as part of a bond approved in May 2008. Bush is adjacent to the Greenhill School and is located along Addison's trail system; therefore the school will be accessible by bicycle or on foot from the Les Lacs and Midway Meadows subdivisions.

=== History of schools serving Addison ===
The Addison School building was opened in 1914. In 1954 the school became a part of the Dallas ISD, and the school closed in 1964. The school building is now the "Magic Time Machine Restaurant."McLaughlin was built in 1959. Field was built in 1960. Stark opened in 1963. R. L. Turner High School opened in 1962, replacing Carrollton High School.Prior to fall 2006, all Addison residents were zoned to Frank for Kindergarten through 4th Grade, E. D. Walker Elementary School for 5th and 6th grades, and Marsh Middle School for 7th and 8th grades. Junkins Elementary School opened in fall 2006, relieving Anne Frank, and Tom C. Gooch Elementary School took an additional portion of Frank's attendance zone. During the same year, Walker became a middle school, serving the Frank and Junkins-zoned sections of Addison, while the Gooch-zoned section was still assigned to Marsh.In fall 2008 boundary changes rezoned the Frank-zoned section of Addison from W. T. White and Walker to Hillcrest and Franklin. In addition, Strickland was dedicated in 2008.George Herbert Walker Bush Elementary School opened in Addison in 2011. As a result, boundary changes during that year involve Bush taking attendance zone territory from Tom C. Gooch, Frank, and Junkins elementary schools. Because of Bush's opening, now Walker MS and White MS served the Junkins and Bush zones, while Franklin continued to serve the Frank zone. Because Gooch is no longer serving portions of Addison, Marsh Middle School no longer serves portions of Addison.
