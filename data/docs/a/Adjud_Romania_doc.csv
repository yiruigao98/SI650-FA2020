== History ==

In the northern part of the town a settlement from the Bronze Age was discovered, which dates roughly from the second millennium BC and belongs to Monteoru culture. Geto-Dacian vestiges of 5th century BC were also found here.
The first mention of the town is made by its Hungarian name Egyedhalma (“in oppido nostro Egydhalm” meaning "in our city Gilles’ Hill") in a Latin language document from 1433, where Iliaș of Moldavia granted commercial privileges to Transylvanian Saxon merchants. The Romanian name of Adjud derives from the Hungarian one. The original name supports the idea that the town was established by Hungarian Csángós settled in Moldavia as part of a systematic Hungarian imperial policy to settle Hungarian and partly German population in places of strategic economic, commercial and military importance with the task to control and defend the eastern frontier of Hungary.The Battle of Adjud occurred here on October 14, 1788, during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), pitting the armies of the Russian Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy (under the command of field marshal Baron Spleny von Mihald) against those of the Ottoman Empire.Adjud was declared a city in 1948. In 1950 it became the residence of Adjud district from Putna Region, then (after 1952) from Bârlad Region and (after 1956) from the Bacău Region. In 1968, it became a city of Vrancea County, while in 2000 Adjud was declared a municipality.
