Arcueil (French: [aʁkœj] (listen)) is a commune in the Val-de-Marne department in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 5.3 km (3.3 mi) from the center of Paris.


== Name ==

The name Arcueil was recorded for the first time in 1119 as Arcoloï, and later in the 12th century as Arcoïalum, meaning "place of the arches" (Latin radical arcus, "arch", and Celtic suffix -ialo, "clearing, glade", "place of"), in reference to the Roman aqueduct carrying water to the Roman city of Lutetia (modern Paris). Still standing, the arches of the Roman aqueduct are still visible since the Middle Ages, crossing the Bièvre River valley near Arcueil.


== History ==

Between 1613 and 1624 a bridge-aqueduct over 1300 ft. long was constructed to convey water from the spring of Rungis, south of Arcueil, across the Bièvre river to the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. Between 1868 and 1872 another aqueduct, still longer, was superimposed above that of the 17th century, forming part of the system conveying water from the river Vanne to Paris.The commune of Arcueil was officially renamed Arcueil-Cachan in 1894, after the hamlet of Cachan located within the commune. On 26 December 1922, Cachan seceded from the commune of Arcueil-Cachan and became a commune in its own right. The reduced commune of Arcueil-Cachan was renamed simply Arcueil.
