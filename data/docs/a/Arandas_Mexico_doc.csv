== Local toponymy ==
The name is derived from the original name the existing population received during the 17th century: Santa María de Guadalupe de los Aranda, which was derived from the last name Aranada, one of the founding families; along with Camarena, Hernández Gamiño and Hernández Rull.


== History ==
Originally, the region was inhabited by the Chichimeca and the Purépecha people. To show the origin of this community more extensively, the past was excavated and information was linked together until reaching its institutional origin that dates to July 2, 1544, the year that both the viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza, as the governor of Jalisco Francisco Vasquez de Colorado, leased out a series of land bonds to Spanish captain Juan Villaseñor y Orozco, which by its vast land area became a large estate.
