== History ==
The area was sparsely populated in the initial centuries since the settlement of the island. While Viera y Clavijo mentioned a small village of the same name in an early work on the islands, a church was not built until the 17th century and this church did not obtain the status of a parish church until March 1796.
The economy until the twentieth century was based on fishing and agriculture including cochineal, bananas and cattle. There was also a small quarry in the fishing village of Los Cristianos in the nineteenth century.
In the first half of the twentieth century, the population grew slowly despite a slump in cochineal prices, a general decline in farming and the Spanish Civil War. However, the economy and population has grown rapidly in recent years as it has become a popular tourist destination. The population has grown from 13,556 in 1981 to 28,208 in 1996.  The 2005 population has finally reached over 60,000. In contrast, the municipality had a population of approximately 2,000 in 1901. The tourism industry employs 60% of the workforce.
Since 2015, the town of Los Cristianos in Arona is the headquarters of the Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands, which is the organization that brings together associations and Muslim communities of the Canary Islands.
