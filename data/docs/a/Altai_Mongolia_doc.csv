The city of Altai (Mongolian: Алтай) is the capital of the Govi-Altai province (aimag) in western Mongolia. The capital is officially named Yesönbulag sum. It is not to be confused with the separate sum also named Altai in the south of the aimag. City population is 15,800 (2008 est.)


== Transportation ==
The Altai Airport (LTI / ZMAT) has one runway and is served by regular flights to Arvaikheer and Ulan Bator.


== Climate ==
Altai has a typical Mongolian cold semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk) with subarctic (Dfc) influences, although the climate is so dry as to qualify as semi-arid despite the annual mean being sufficient for sporadic permafrost. The climate experiences long, very dry and very cold winters with short, mild summers when the majority of the scant precipitation occurs.
