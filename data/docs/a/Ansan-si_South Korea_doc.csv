== History ==


=== Ancient Era ===
The first humans in Ansan were in the New Stone Age, and many shell middens and prehistoric remains were found at Oido, Sihwaho, Chojidong and Daebudo. In the Seonbu-dong and Wolpi-dong area, over 10 stone dolmen tombs could be found. Also in 1995, Old Stone Age relics were found while constructing the Seohaean Expressway. Most dolmens in Ansan are north dolmen, but the dolmen in Seonbu-dong is table-shaped and another table-shaped tomb was found in Hakon-dong, Gwangmyeong. There are many ancient relics found in the city.


=== Three Kingdoms and Goryeo Era ===
Not much evidence or antiquities survive from the Proto-Three Kingdoms and Samhan periods are in Ansan and nearby areas. The Mahan confederacy in Chen Shou in Records of the Three Kingdoms preserves writings about the chiefdom state. Ansan was in communion with Baekje but very little has been saved.
In the Later Three Kingdoms era, the Ansan area was owned by Taebong (also known as Hugoguryeo, "Later Goguryeo") in Silla Hyogong's 4th year (AD 900). After then, Gung Ye, who was ruler of Taebong, was overthrown by Wang Geon, and the Ansan area was turned over to Goryeo, founded by Wang Geon. First the Gung Ye Ganggu-gun was changed to Ansan-gun but the state of the military was preserved.


=== Joseon Era ===
Ansan belonged to Gyeonggijwa-do (left Gyeonggi province) in the Joseon dynasty. Taejo's 5th year (AD 1396), Ansan-eoso (meaning Ansan fishery) that is now under direct control of a detached building of Saongwon (the Department of foods and meals in the Joseon dynasty) was set up. After Gyeonggijwa-do and Gyeonggiwo-do (right Gyeonggi province) were unified in Teajong's 2nd year (AD 1402), Ansan was still called Ansan. Under Teajong's 13th (1413), the whole country was detached into eight provinces.


=== Modern Era ===
Until 1914, Ansan City and the southern part of today's Siheung city consisted of Ansan County. In 1914, Ansan County was annexed to Siheung County. This region produced high quality salt from ancient times and valuable marine products. Ansan was then a fishing village.
In 1986, several towns of Hwaseong county became incorporated, representing the beginning of Ansan as a city. With currently over 700,000 residents, Ansan now has two distinct and separate districts: Danwon, which has 12 dongs as of 2009, and Sangnok, with 13.
