ARCore is a software development kit developed by Google that allows for augmented reality applications to be built.
ARCore uses three key technologies to integrate virtual content with the real world as seen through your phone's camera:
Six degrees of freedom allows the phone to understand and track its position relative to the world.
Environmental understanding allows the phone to detect the size and location of flat horizontal surfaces like the ground or a coffee table.
Light estimation allows the phone to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions.ARCore has been integrated into a multitude of devices.
