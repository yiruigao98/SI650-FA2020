North Korea is a country in Northeast Asia, which may have as many as 78 usable airfields, although the state's secrecy makes it difficult to ascertain their number and condition with certainty. This is a list of airports in North Korea.
The state carrier, Air Koryo, joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in the late 1990s, and North Korea has proclaimed a program to upgrade several airports to international standards.  However, with the exception of Pyongyang Sunan International Airport and a few that receive irregular service by Air Koryo, commercial aviation in North Korea is practically non-existent and most airfields appear to be military use.
