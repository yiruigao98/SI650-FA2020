Aliağa, is a town and a district of Izmir Province in the Aegean Region of Turkey. The town is situated at about 50 km (31 mi) north of Izmir. Aliağa has a big port, mainly for oil and bulk. Its economic activity is based on tourism, shipbreaking, and an oil refinery.


== Overview ==
Aliağa lies in the heart of ancient Aeolia. The town was named after a member of the influential Karaosmanoğulları ayan family, Karaosmanoğlu Ali Ağa, who owned an estate here. It was a township in Menemen district in 1937 and became a municipality in 1952. It finally separated from Menemen and became a district on 21 January 1982.
The remains of the ancient city of Myrina are within the boundaries of the district, located at about fifteen km north of Aliağa center. Another important site is the yet unexplored Gryneion, near Şakran township on the peninsula, to the south of the center town, also at a distance of 15 km (9 mi). Visitors also often use the road from Aliağa to visit the remains of Aigai in Yuntdağı in Manisa Province.
The D.550 roadway runs through the city, between Muğla-Edirne and also to İzmir. Aliağa is also connected to İzmir by İZBAN, a commuter railway operating around İzmir. İZBAN operates 15 daily trains from Aliağa Railway Station to Alsancak Terminal in İzmir. ESHOT operates the 740 bus line to İzmir as well.
There are several facilities for dismantling and scrapping ships.
