Al-Jahra Governorate (Arabic: محافظة الجهراء‎ Muḥāfaẓat al-Ǧahrāʾ) is one of the six Governorates of Kuwait.  It is located to the northwest of the other Governorates and houses the city of Jahra among others. It includes Bubiyan Island and is the largest Governorate in Kuwait.  It also contains most of Kuwait's arable land.  Jahra also has some historic relevance to Kuwait's history.  The Red Palace or Al Qasr Al Ahmar is the most important historical landmark there. In and around it the famous battle between Kuwait and the Dweesh army took place. When Jahra was a village it was an oasis and most Jahrans were farmers.  Now Jahra is a large city and farming has been reduced to a few small farms. The geographic midpoint of Kuwait is located in this governorate.
