Anmore (2016 population 2,210), British Columbia, Canada, is a village municipality in Metro Vancouver, north of the city of Port Moody and along the shores of the Indian Arm. It is one of three politically independent villages (municipalities with populations under 2,500) in the Greater Vancouver area, the others being its neighbour, Belcarra, and Lions Bay.


== Origin of the name ==
Anmore got its name from a local homesteader, F. J. Lancaster, who combined the names of his wife (Annie) and his daughter (Leonore) to make "Annore." This evolved into the village's current name.


== Demographics ==


=== 2016 ===
According to the 2016 census, Anmore had a population of 2,210 in that year.Anmore residents have high incomes, with an average household income of $186,134 in 2016. The median household income was $139,469, the highest in all of Metro Vancouver, compared to $69,995 for British Columbia as a whole.


== Neighbourhood ==
Often referred to as "The Hamptons of Metro Vancouver", Anmore is a wealthy, coveted neighbourhood, with residential properties ranging in the millions.
A 1978 plan for the village to have 15,000 residents by 1988 was vocally opposed by its residents, and they have instead insisted on preserving what they call their "semi-rural" goal. Consistent with this earlier citizen opposition to development, in a referendum concomitant with the municipal election of 2002, 70% of the citizens of Anmore voted in favour of maintaining the existing RS-1 zoning (1 acre lot size), 70% in favour of the 1-acre (4,000 m2) zoning with further enhancements, another 77% voted against half acre zoning, and 67% against a half acre every five years.
Anmore is home to the Buntzen Lake recreation area, which is a popular tourist destination for its two beaches located on each end, as well as its network of hiking and biking trails that surround the lake. Managed by BC Hydro, the lake is used to power two hydroelectric stations located on Indian Arm.


== Transportation ==
There are two main streets in Anmore both of which terminate at Port Moody. Sunnyside Road runs primarily north-south from the near sea-level western entrance of the village to the entrance of Buntzen Lake at the northern end of the village.  East Road enters Anmore from Heritage Mountain, and runs primarily north-south until about the 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) mark where it turns and runs east-west until its termination at Sunnyside Road. There are several proposed plans to build another street between Port Moody and Anmore.
As part of Metro Vancouver, Anmore is connected to the TransLink public transit system and is served by the 182 Community Shuttle bus that runs down both major streets, Sunnyside Road and East Road. Supplemental summertime service to Buntzen Lake is provided by the 179 service from Coquitlam Central Station.


== Notable people ==
Anmore was a long-time home for Canadian icon Margaret Lally "Ma" Murray, an American-Canadian newspaper editor, publisher, and columnist, an officer of the Order of Canada, and the wife of publisher and British Columbia MLA George Matheson Murray. George and "Ma" Murray's former home at the corner of Sunnyside and East Road was donated to the Village in 1988 by the owners at the time, and acted as Anmore's village hall until early 2018, when the 100-year-old homestead was demolished.
Ryan Johansen, professional ice hockey centre and alternate captain for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL), resides in Anmore.
