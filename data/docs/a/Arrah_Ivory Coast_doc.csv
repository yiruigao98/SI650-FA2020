Departments of Ivory Coast (French: départements de Côte d'Ivoire, also known as collectivités territoriale) are currently the third-level administrative subdivision of the country. Each of the 31 second-level regions of Ivory Coast is divided into two or more departments. (The autonomous districts contain no regions, but they do contain departments.) Each department is divided into two or more sub-prefectures, which are the fourth-level subdivisions in Ivory Coast. As of 2016, there are 108 departments of Ivory Coast.
There is one area of Ivory Coast that is not governed by departments: the portion of Comoé National Park that is within Zanzan District is not assigned to any department.
Departments were first created in 1961. During their existence, they have been first-, second-, and third-level administrative subdivisions.

== History ==


=== 1961–69 ===

Departments were established in 1961 and were the original first-level administrative subdivision of independent Ivory Coast. Initially, there were just four departments: Centre, Nord, Sud-Est, and Sud-Ouest. In 1963, two more departments were created: Est was created by dividing Sud-Est, and Centre-Ouest) was created by dividing Sud-Ouest. As a result of the divisions, Sud-Est was renamed Sud and Sud-Ouest was renamed Ouest.


=== 1969: 24 new departments ===
In 1969, the six departments were abolished and in their place 24 new departments were created. The following table illustrates how the old departments were divided into the new departments:

Due to a lack of government resources, the 1969 changes were not fully implemented until 1974.


=== Subsequent divisions and relegation to second-level ===
From 1974 onward, new departments were occasionally created through division of pre-existing departments. New departments were created in 1974 (2), 1980 (8), 1988 (15), and 1995 (1). In 1997, when there were 50 departments, regions were created, which supplanted departments as the first-level administrative subdivision. As a result, the 50 departments became second-level divisions.
More departments were created in 1998 (8), 2005 (12), 2008 (11), and 2009 (9). By the time of the late-2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, there were 90 departments in 19 regions.


=== 2011 subdivision reorganisation ===
In the 2011 reorganisation of the subdivisions of Ivory Coast, five new departments were created, bringing the total to 95. More significantly, however, districts were created as a new first-level division. As a result, regions became second-level subdivisions and the 95 departments became third-level subdivisions.


=== Post-2011 changes ===
Since the 2011 reorganisation, 13 more departments have been created, bringing the total number to 108. Twelve departments were created in 2012 and one was created in 2013.


== Names and governance ==
Departments are named after the city or town that serves as the seat of the department. In most cases, this is the most populous settlement in the department.
Each department is headed by a prefect, who is appointed by the council of ministers (cabinet) of the national government. For departments that house regional capitals, the prefect of the department is the same individual as the prefect of the region, though the two offices of prefect remain distinct.Each department is divided into two or more sub-prefectures, which serve as fourth-level administrative subdivisions. There are currently 510 sub-prefectures in the country.
