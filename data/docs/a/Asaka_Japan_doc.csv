== History ==
The area of modern Asaka developed as a series of four post stations on the Kawagoe Kaidō highway from the Muromachi period onwards.
The village of Hizaori was created within Niikura District, Saitama with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Niikura District was abolished in 1894 and became part of Kitaadachi District. It was raised to town status on May 1, 1921, and renamed Asaka after Prince Asaka who was an honorary chairman of the Tokyo Golf Club, which relocated to the area at that time.
On April 1, 1955, Asaka annexed the neighboring village of Uchimagi.  At the 1964 Summer Olympics in neighboring Tokyo, the town hosted the riding part of the modern pentathlon event at Asaka Nezu Park.
Asaka was elevated to city status on March 15, 1967.
