The first mosque of the Netherlands was built in Almelo in 1976 for the Turkish population of the city. Almelo also has a sizeable number of Armenians who built their own Armenian Apostolic Church in 2003.In the 1970s the industry dwindled and most factories were relocated to countries with cheaper labour.
