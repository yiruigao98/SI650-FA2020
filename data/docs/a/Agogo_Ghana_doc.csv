== History ==
Around the year 1500, the people of the Aduana clan in Asantemanso, who were originally from Esumegya, dispersed to settle in different parts of the country. One group settled at Nyanawase under Ansa Sasraku, but moved again after a series of wars with the Ashantis and the Gas. In the end they settled in Akwamu.
In or around the year 1600, three chiefs of the Aduana clan: Ofori Krobon of Agogo, Ntori Nimpa of Kwaman, and Effa Kai of Kumawu left Akwamu to join forces under the command of Ofori Krobon of Agogo with the intension of fighting and defeating Ataara Finam. He was the supreme ruler of the Afram plains at that time. This war lasted for almost three years. All the lands controlled by the vanquished Ataara Finam were annexed to the three stools who were independent of each other. Because of this annexation, the three stools - Agogo, Kumawu and Kwaman - all controlled some of the most extensive land possessions in the Ashanti Union. Their lands extended to Akwamu, the Volta Region, Brong Ahafo and to parts of the Northern Region.
Meanwhile, the people of Agogo settled in Santenso, which is where the three-year war with Ataara Finam came to an end. Like all other Asante states, the people of Agogo had remained an independent entity until the need to form a union of states became apparent. The people of Agogo did directly participate in the Denkyira war in 1698, which concluded in the liberation of Asanteman from Denkyira under Ashanti King Asantehene Osei Tutu I. However, they did contribute men and materials to support the Ashanti forces.
