== History ==


=== Anderson Court House ===

Cherokee first settled the area of what is today the city of Anderson. During the American Revolution the Cherokee sided with the British. After the American Revolutionary War the Cherokee's land was acquired as war reparations and colonized. In 1791 the South Carolina legislature created the Washington District which comprised Greenville, Anderson, Oconee and Pickens counties. The Washington District was then divided into Greenville and Pendleton districts. Anderson, Pickens and Oconee comprised the newly created Pendleton district. Anderson was settled in 1826 and incorporated in 1828 as Anderson Court House separating from the Pendleton district. The name Anderson is in honor of Robert Anderson who fought in the American Revolutionary War and also explored the Anderson region in the mid-18th century. Anderson District (later Anderson County after 1867) was also established in 1826 out of the Pendleton district.
In 1851 the Johnson Female Seminary was established in Anderson as the first college of the town and was named after William Bullein Johnson. One year later the seminary was renamed Johnson University. During the American Civil War Johnson University was closed and converted into a Confederate treasury. On May 1, 1865 Union forces invaded Anderson looking for the Confederate treasury. The treasury office of Anderson was ransacked by Union forces and the main building of Johnson University was used as a Union headquarters. A minor skirmish erupted at the Battle of Anderson leading to two Union casualties. After the war a Union garrison was stationed in Anderson.

Anderson became one of the first cities in the Southeastern United States to have electricity. Electricity to Anderson was established by William C. Whitner in 1895 at a hydroelectric plant on the Rocky River giving the city the name "The Electric City." Anderson also became the first city in the world to supply a cotton gin by electricity. In 1895 Anderson Court House was renamed to Anderson. In 1897 Whitner's plant was upgraded with a 10,000 volt generating station at Portman Shoals. Whitner's power plant at Portman Shoals became the first hydroelectric plant in the United States to generate high voltage without step-up transformers . The Portman Dam was swept away in 1901 forcing Anderson to be in darkness until it was rebuilt in 1902.
