Cairo Governorate  is the most populated of the governorates of Egypt.  Its capital, the city of Cairo, is the national capital of Egypt, and is part of the Greater Cairo metropolitan area.  Because it is completely urbanized, the governorate is considered a city proper, and functions as a municipality. However, there are uninhabited desert areas.
Parts of the governorate were separated in April 2008 to form the Helwan Governorate, only to be reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate in April 2011.
