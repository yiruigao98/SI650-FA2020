The extraction process involves first pulverizing the raw material, and then filtering out the gold using a cyanide nitrate chemical process.The soupy byproduct of the cyanide nitrate chemical process is both toxic and radioactive and collects in a tailing pond. There have been numerous incidents of animals dying near and around the plant's area.
