Since then, McDonald’s expanded its presence across the region, opening its first stores in Costa Rica in 1970, in Brazil in 1979, in Mexico and Venezuela in 1985 and in Argentina in 1986.Arcos Dorados was formed on August 3, 2007, as a result of the acquisition of McDonald’s Corporation's Latin American business by the region’s operations managers. Prior to the acquisition, Woods Staton, Arcos Dorados’ Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder, was the joint venture partner of McDonald’s in Argentina for more than 20 years and also served as President of McDonald’s South Latin America division from 2004 until the acquisition.

== Advertising and promotion ==
Through McDonald’s, Arcos Dorados sponsors several global sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil.   The company uses similar advertising and in-store campaigns as McDonald’s. For example, the McDonald’s Monopoly campaign, which has been a global campaign for many years, is run in several countries in Latin America, including Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
McDonald’s has been targeted by advocacy groups to end advertising and marketing to children. In 2008, Arcos Dorados implemented McDonald’s Children's Marketing Global Guidelines which stipulate that the company communicate balanced food choices that fit within a child's nutritional needs; use its licensed characters and properties to encourage physical activity and promote balanced food choices for children; instill positive messages about well-being, body, mind and spirit; provide national information to help parents and families make informed choices, and engage third parties to help guide its efforts.

== Environmental and social responsibility ==


=== Sustainable food sourcing ===
There are many myths and misperceptions about the quality of McDonald’s products, including ingredients and additives in its beef products. A recent television and online campaign by Arcos Dorados called "Beyond our Kitchen" or "Mas Alla De La Cocina" highlights the origin of the ingredients used in McDonald's restaurants and  addresses questions about the quality of McDonald’s food by showing the farms where the beef, chicken, potatoes and vegetables come from and how the food is handled and processed before making its way to a McDonald's restaurant.
Globally, McDonald’s has worked with animal welfare expert, Dr. Temple Grandin, since the mid-1990s to help ensure animals in the supply chain are properly cared for. McDonald's is currently in discussion with its pork suppliers to explore ways to phase out gestation stalls for pigs and is working with producers and suppliers to develop traceability systems to prove that the meat it buys is not from farms that use gestation stalls.McDonald’s became a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) in 2012. The group is working to advance the sustainable production of beef through the commitment of stakeholders in the beef value chain. One hundred percent of Arcos Dorados’ beef and oil suppliers have committed to ending procurement of any goods produced as a consequence of any forest clearance from the Amazon.


=== Supply chain ===
All of Arcos Dorados food and paper suppliers comply with McDonald’s Supplier Workplace Accountability policy, which stipulates that workers are compensated and treated fairly, work in safe conditions and produce high quality foods and packaging.Arcos Dorados also surveys and audits its suppliers in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure their operations meet McDonald’s quality, health and safety standards.  based on globally recognized, established industry standards including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP).


=== Reducing consumption ===
McDonald's restaurants use a significant amount of energy, specifically in cold storage to protect food safety. During the past several years, Arcos Dorados implemented a restaurant maintenance strategy to reduce water consumption, energy utilization where possible and waste reduction at its restaurants.
As one example, the company developed a collection and storage system for the water generated through condensation from the air conditioning equipment. They used the collected water to clean external areas and to water plants, reducing daily water consumption at one restaurant in Brazil from 8,000 liters to 6,800 liters.
