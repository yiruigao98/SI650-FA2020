== History ==
Archaeologists have found evidence of settlements in Aluva as far back as 250 BC. The place used to be a continuous area of land spread across Kakkanad and Alangad; historians have recorded that it was so up to AD 1341. The town, by then thickly populated, became a holiday resort and a centre of commerce.  Mangalappuzha, a branch of Periyar which bifurcates at Aluva was known to be the nerve centre of trade and commerce in this part of South India. Before Indian independence, Aluva was part of the Kingdom of Travancore and was the official summer residence of the royal family.
The etymology of the name of the town of Aluva has been the subject of speculation for centuries. One of the more accepted version relates to the story of Hindu god Shiva drinking the Kalakootam poison to save the world. It is said that Shiva with the poison 'Alam' in his mouth 'Vaa' was made into a deity which was then rested in a temple in Aluva. The Sivarathri festival for which the town is famous for is celebrated in the honour of Shiva.  In the twentieth century, when there was a community of Jews in Cochin, some used to have holiday homes in Aluva on the banks of the River Periyar. It also has a name "gate way to east"

== Aluva Railway Station ==
There are two railway stations in Aluva: Aluva Railway Station. Aluva Railway Station is a major stop for trains that passes north to south of Kerala. It is the second busiest station in Kerala by number of trains, second only to Thrissur. The station is important for southern railway because of the number of passengers itself. The commuters and travellers from Idukki district have to use either this station or the Tripunithura railway station for all their train journeys as there is no possible railway in the Idukki topography. There are no trains starting or ending at this station, but there are a lot of trains which stop for considerable duration here.
Aluva Railway Station is situated at the Railway Station Road junction near the KSRTC stand. The KSRTC stand hosts many buses from Ernakulam and a lot of City Low Floor buses, both A/C and non A/C which ensures connectivity to almost all the places in Kerala.


== Aluva Mahadeva Temple ==
The Mahadeva Temple is situated at a distance of 1 km from the Marthanda Varma bridge in NH-47. Periyar river splits into two near Aluva railway bridge and after the splitting one part is called Mangalappuzha. Aluva Mahadeva Temple is located on the sand bank in between the Mangalppuzha and Periyar river. Aluva Mahadeva Temple is managed by Travancore Devaswom Board.
The unique feature of Aluva Mahadeva Temple is that the Shivalinga is not enshrined in a Sreekovil. The Swayambhoo Shivalinga installed by Lord Parasurama and worshipped by Lord Sree Rama rises out of the sand banks of the Periyar river. This place is called the Aluva Manal Puram (land with sand).
There are many legends associated with this temple. After installing the Lingam Parasurama built a temple here but was destroyed by a flood. Lord Shiva told him that no temple structure will exist at that place because He does not want a temple structure for protecting the Lingam. Another legend goes like this. The Bhuthaganas of Lord Shiva worshiped the Lingam every night. They decided to construct a temple there. But Lord Shiva told them that they must complete the temple in a single night. Bhuthaganas agreed and started the construction. When the foundation was completed, Lord Vishnu came there, disguised as a cock and crowed to mislead the Bhuthaganas. The Bhuthaganas, fearing that dawn had approached, left the work unfinished. Sri Rama, during his search for Sitha, performed tharpana for Jadayu here. Another legend is associated with Vilwamangalam Swamiyar. One day he visited this place and realised the presence of Lord Shiva and identified the Shiva Linga installed by Parasurama. He started worshipping the Linga and Lord Mahadeva appeared in front of him and told him to start poojas there. Pottayil Ilayathu, Thottathil Nambiar and Idamana Nampoothiri made proper arrangements for Shiva Pooja and Vilwamngalam started the pooja. But there were no vessels to offer Nivedyam. So Vilwamangalam used a Kavungin Pala (aracanut leaf) to offer Nivedyam. Even today the nivedyam is offered in Kavungin Pala and is called Palanivedyam. Later Vilwamangalam and his associates – Ilayathu, Nambiar and Nampoothiri – constructed a temple but it was destroyed by flood in AD 1343. During the monsoon season the whole region gets flooded and the Shivalinga gets submerged in water. So the Ooranma Nampoothiris were decided to construct a small temple on the bank of the river in order to perform poojas during monsoon season. This temple is called Bala Kshetram. It is a fact that though unfinished in nature, this temple has withstood many a flood and still stands as an enigma to the architects, regarding its foundation and structure. The Travancore Devaswom Board authorities constructed a temple structure here some years ago. but the Deva Prasna conducted later revealed that construction of the temple structure is against Lord Shiva's wish.


== Kochi Metro Rail Limited ==
Kochi Metro Rail Limited, the pride project of Kerala Government, undertaken by DMRC starts from Aluva Bypass. Aluva metro station is the northern terminus of the line which was open on 19 June 2017.
