AlUla (Arabic: ٱلْعُلَا‎ al-ʿulā), also Al-ʿUla, is a governorate of the Medina Region and a city in north-western Saudi Arabia. Historically located on the incense route, the city lies within the Governorate of 'Ula (Arabic: مُحَافَظَة ٱلْعُلَا‎, romanized: Muḥāfaẓat Al-ʿUlā), one of seven in the Medina Region, covering an area of 29,261 square kilometres (11,298 sq mi). The city is 110 km (68 mi) southwest of Tayma and 300 km (190 mi) north of Medina. The city (municipality) covers 2,391 square kilometres (923 sq mi). The population of the city is 5,426.AlUla was the capital of the ancient Lihyanites (Dedanites). The governorate contains the first UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Saudi Kingdom, called Hegra (also known as Al-Hijr, or Mada'in Saleh / Mada'in Salih), 22 km (14 mi) north of the city. Hegra (Mada'in Salih) was built more than 2,000 years ago by the Nabataeans. AlUla, the ancient walled city, is packed with mud-brick and stone houses.


== History ==

The walled city of AlUla was founded in the 6th century BC, an oasis in the desert valley, with fertile soil and plenty of water. It was located along "Incense Road", the network of routes that facilitated the trading of spices, silk and other luxury items through Arabia, Egypt and India. AlUla stands on the site of the Biblical city of Dedan but was founded with the ancient North Arabian Kingdom of Lihyan, which ruled from the 5th to 2nd century BC. The older history of the oasis has been divided into several phases. The Dedanite kingdom spans the seventh and sixth centuries BC. Dedan is mentioned in the 'Harran Inscriptions'. In these it is told how Nabonidus the king of Babylonia made a military campaign to northern Arabia in 552 BC or somewhat later, conquering Tayma Dedan and Yathrib (Medina). It is thought that around the turn of the fifth century BC the kingdom became hereditary.
The next four hundred years, until around 100 BC, were the time of the Kingdom of Lihyan. The Nabataeans were the lords of the region at least until 106 AD when the Romans conquered their capital Petra. The Nabataeans made Hegra, the modern Mada'in Salih, their second capital. The power centre of the region thus shifted to Hegra some 22 km (14 mi) to the north of AlUla.
The Islamic Nabi (Prophet) Muhammad passed through AlUla in 630 on his campaign to Tabuk. Al-Mabiyat some 20 km (12 mi) away near Mughaira became the next commercial centre of the region. It thrived from around 650 until it declined at some time before 1230. In the 13th century the old city of AlUla was built and many stones of the old Dedanite and Lihyanite ruins were reused. AlUla now became the major settlement of the region again until modern times. Between 1901 and 1908 the Ottomans built the Hejaz railway in order to link Damascus to Madinah. The railway had main stations in both Mada'in Salih (Hegra) and AlUla, where a line was built through the western part of Al-Khuraybah, some 12 km (7.5 mi) to the north of the old medieval town, which is believed to be the site of the old Dedanite and Lihyanite town that is still standing there despite being in bad shape.In the 20th century the new town centre was established beside the old town and eventually the people left the old buildings. The last family is said to have left in 1983, whilst the last service in the old mosque was held in 1985. Both the ruins of the medieval town and the site of the Liyhanite settlement now lie within the limits of the modern town.
The most detailed study of the area was made by the French priests Antonin Jaussen and Raphael Savignac, who visited the area three times, in 1907, 1908 and 1910.  They studied the remains at Hegra and Dedan and collected a large number of Lihyanite, Minaean, Thamudic and Nabataean inscriptions. Accordingly, it was their work that came to constitute the basis for all further study and research in the history of the area.The first European traveller of modern times to describe the town was Charles Doughty in 1876. Charles Huber was in AlUla in 1881–82. He returned in 1883 accompanied by Julius Euting. In 1968 a team of archaeologists from the University of London investigated some fifteen inscriptions.
The vertical sandstone cliffs surrounding the valley provide ample surfaces for rock art, making the governorate one of the richer petroglyph regions in the Kingdom. Ar-Ruzeiqiah is a mountain in the southern part of the governorate, with a large petroglyph panel displaying hundreds of images, including depictions of hunting scenes with humans and a variety of animals. Ibex are the most common species but camels, horses and other species can also be found. Mount Ikma also has a large façade with scenes, strange symbols and inscriptions.


== Cities, towns, villages ==
There are four major municipalities in the Governorate of 'Ula: AlUla: the capital lying to the southwest (population 5,426); Mughīrāʾ (Arabic: مُغِيْرَاء‎) to the southeast (population 8,952); Abu Raku, to the north (population 2,678); and Al Hajar to the northeast (population 1,707).


=== Heritage Village ===
AlUla Heritage Village, also known as Ad-Deerah, is the traditional Arabian village to which people of the oasis moved some eight centuries ago and inhabited until the 20th century. It was built on a higher part of the valley in order to be clear of the floods that can occur during the rainy season. At its maximum expansion the town contained more than 1000 houses, which were built adjacent to one another, thereby forming a wall around the town to defend the population. On the west of the town, at the bottom of the cliff, is the old souq, which has been renovated.


== Timeline ==
Here is the sequence of historical events and the ancient evidence found in the AlUla governorate:


== Royal Commission for AlUla ==

The importance of AlUla as an archaeological and historic site led to the establishment of The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) in July 2017, the aim of which is to develop and promote AlUla as an international tourism destination. Moreover, the commission develops the plans for heritage conservation and preservation.


== Development plan ==
To promote tourism and gain more attraction, the Royal Commission on AlUla is training 200 young Saudis on an ambitious project where tourists will explore one of the greatest profusions of cultural treasures to be found anywhere in the world. Recruited from the AlUla region, the 200 young people (all high-school age or in their first year as university students, and split 50-50 between boys and girls) are in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia being trained in hospitality, learning new languages, studying farming and water technology, and researching the cultural, social and natural history of their home region.


== Tourism ==
AlUla has the potential to be one of the most important archaeological destinations for tourists from across the world. Saudi Arabia is collaborating with experts from around the world on the AlUla development and in April signed a 10-year deal with France that includes provisions for hotels, transport infrastructure and a world-class culture and art museum.A major integrated archaeological survey of AlUla valley and beyond has been launched by the commission, charged with protecting and regenerating this north-western region. Until a conservation and development plan can be established, some of the sites including the World Heritage Site of Mada'in Salih are temporarily closed to the public. It will re-open in 2020 for the visitors.


=== Sharaan Resort ===
A resort is planned to be built as early as 2020 and completed in 2023 in Sharaan area. The result will have residential places, a conference venue, a relaxing area and restaurants.


== "Winter at Tantora" festival ==
Winter at Tantora was a traditional celebration to mark the start of the 40 day winter growing season.  The name of the festival 'Tantora' is inspired by a sundial located in the old town of AlUla, which has been using by the locals as a marker for the changing of the seasons.
