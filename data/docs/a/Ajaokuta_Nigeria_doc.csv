== Ajaokuta Steel Mill ==

The town is the home of the multibillion-dollar Ajaokuta Steel Mill, the largest steel mill in Nigeria.  Begun by the Soviet Union in 1979 under a cooperation agreement with Nigeria, the complex reached 98% completion by 1994.  The steelworks have been called the "bedrock of Nigeria’s industrialization".  However, the project has been mismanaged, and the steel mill has not produced a single sheet of steel as of December 2017.


== Transport ==
The town is not connected to the Nigerian railway system, except by river.  In 1987, a contract was awarded for the construction of a standard gauge railway from the iron mines at Itakpe to the steelworks at Ajaokuta, continuing to the Atlantic Ocean port city of Warri.  The Warri–Ajaokuta–Itakpe line is still incomplete as of August 2017, and the section from Itakpe to Ajaokuta has been vandalised.  The Nigerian government plans to repair the railway and put it into operation in June 2018.
