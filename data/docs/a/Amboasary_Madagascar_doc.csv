This is a list of major cities in Madagascar with population (1993 census and 2018 census), region, and former province. These are listed in order of their 2018 population. Note that these are the populations of the cities themselves (i.e. administrative districts, except in the case of Ambovombe) and exclude the populations of suburban communes outside the cities; some of the communes adjacent to Antananarivo have more than 100,000 population themselves.
