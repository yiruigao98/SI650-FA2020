Amsterdam is a city in Montgomery County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 18,620. The city is named after Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
The City of Amsterdam is surrounded on the north, east, and west sides by the town of Amsterdam. The city developed on both sides of the Mohawk River, with the majority located on the north bank. The Port Jackson area on the south side is also part of the city.


== History ==

Prior to settlement by Europeans, the region which includes Amsterdam was inhabited by the Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy, having pushed the Algonquin Mohican tribe across the Hudson River.  Dutch settlers began to arrive in the area in the 1660s, founding Schenectady in 1664, and arrived in what would later be Amsterdam c.1710. They called the community Veeders Mills and Veedersburgh after Albert Veeder, an early mill owner.  In the early 1700s, Scotch-Irish and German Palatinate immigrants began to arrive in the Mohawk Valley region, but few settled in Amsterdam, instead  going further west.The American Revolutionary War had little effect on the Amsterdam region.  No major battles were fought there or in the surrounding region, with the exception of the Battle of Johnstown, which was essentially the repelling of a raid by British forces and their Native American allies.
The settlement grew slowly in this period, primarily providing the services  needed for the farming communities which surrounded it.  It was located in the now-defunct town of Caughnawaga,  but when the town of Amsterdam was created, the city changed its name to Amsterdam in 1803, possibly to encourage its selection as the seat of the town's government.After the War, Loyalists like the powerful Johnson family fled to Canada, and many new settlers came from New England. The settlement was incorporated as a village on April 20, 1830, from a section of the Town of Amsterdam.  This was a period of rapid growth for the village.  In turn, the Mohawk Turnpike, the Erie Canal, and the coming of railroad service improved trade, and the steeply descending creeks were used to power an increasing number of mills, which in turn provided materials to make manufactured goods which were shipped by land, canal and rail. Products such as linseed oil, brooms, knit ware, buttons, and iron goods came out of the growing village, making it an important manufacturing center. It was best known, however, for its carpets, eventually becoming the carpet and run manufacturing center of the U.S.  Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was a destination for immigrants from Europe: Irish, Italian, Polish, and Lithuanian people, among others, who found worked in the factories.
In 1865, the population of Amsterdam was 5,135.  New charters in 1854, 1865, and 1875 increased the size of the village. In 1885, Amsterdam became a city, which subsequently increased in size by annexation of Rockton to the north, with the former village of Port Jackson on the south side of the Mohawk River becoming the fifth ward of the city. By 1920, the city's population was 33,524.
In the Great Depression the mills slow down their output, but do not close, and the city survives the two world wars without significant effect.  Shortly after World War II, however, manufacturing in general begins to move to the southern United States, where costs – including wages and taxes – are lower, and the mills of Amsterdam are no exception.  One by one, they move south and overseas. In addition second and third generations of the city's immigrant families leave to go to college, and do not return, as there are few jobs to attract college-educated citizens.  The city attempts to re-create its industrial base, but the effort is not terribly successful.
Then, to add insult to injury, the city is hit by urban renewal. As the city's website expresses it: In an attempt to draw people and business back to Amsterdam, the City and State began a program of urban renewal and arterial roadway construction, destroying much of the original fabric of downtown. Now, not only is there less to go downtown for, it's harder to get there. Once again, Amsterdam is somewhere to be bypassed on the way to somewhere else.
In the 21st century, post-industrial Amsterdam is still trying to re-invent itself.Amsterdam experienced serious flooding damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene in late August 2011. The flooding threatened properties at the river's edge due to erosion and water damage.


== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.3 square miles (16.3 km2), of which, 5.9 square miles (15.4 km2) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.9 km2) of it is water. The total area is 5.41% water.
The city developed on both sides of the Mohawk River and Erie Canal. The Chuctanunda River flows into the Mohawk from the north at Amsterdam.
New York State Route 30, a north-south highway called Market Street in part, crosses the Mohawk River to link the main part of Amsterdam to the New York State Thruway. NY-30 also intersects east-west highways New York State Route 5 and New York State Route 67 in the city. New York State Route 5S passes along the south side of the Mohawk River.
Amsterdam is currently within New York's 20th congressional district.


== Economy ==
In the 19th century, the city of Amsterdam was known for carpet, textile, and pearl button manufacturing. It continued to be a center for carpet-making in the 20th century, when the Bigelow-Sanford and Mohawk Mills Carpet companies both were located in Amsterdam, but these companies have relocated to other regions. Amsterdam was also the home of Coleco, makers of the ColecoVision, Cabbage Patch Kids and the Coleco Adam. Founded in 1932 as the Connecticut Leather Company, Coleco went bankrupt in 1988 after a failed attempt to enter the electronics market, and pulled out of Amsterdam, as well as its other North American manufacturing sites.
The enclosed shopping center is named the Amsterdam Riverfront Center. Once filled with clothing shops, the mall complex has been adapted for offices of doctors, public assistance services, community organizations, a radio station WCSS, and an off-track betting site.

Media in Amsterdam includes one print newspaper, The Recorder, which is owned by the Schenectady based Daily Gazette, an online newspaper, The Mohawk Valley Compass, and two AM radio stations, WVTL and WCSS.
In the early 2000s distribution centers began being constructed in the Florida Business Park in the Town of Florida which is located right outside the City of Amsterdam. The park currently holds Target, Hill & Marks, Alpin Haus, and most recent Dollar General. In 2019 Vida Blend broke ground on a new distribution center in the park. These distribution centers provide thousands of jobs to city residents along with residents in other parts of the county.

The Sanford Clock Tower, also known as the Sanford Mills, the Hasbro Plant, the Coleco Industries Plant – where Cabbage Patch Dolls and ColecoVision were manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s – and, currently, the Clock Tower Complex, was built in 1922 for carpet magnate Stephen Sanford as the headquarters and mill of the Sanford-Bigelow Carpet Company. The current owners, who bought the property in 2001, hope to attract small businesses and professional as well as manufacturing and warehousing businesses to the building.
