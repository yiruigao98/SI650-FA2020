== Notable events ==
In the 1970s, the associated Catholic parish of Aguilares was served by Rutilio Grande, a Jesuit priest and activist who was assassinated in the fields near El Paisnal, a neighboring village. For this reason, the Aguilares area figures prominently in the film Romero, a biography of martyred Archbishop Óscar Romero, which shows Grande's work in and around Aguilares just before his death in 1977.
