== History ==
The area of present-day Anjō has been continuously occupied since preshistoric times.  Archaeologists have found numerous remains from the Japanese Paleolithic period and burial mounds from the Kofun period.  During the Nara period, the area was assigned to ancient Hekikai County, and was divided into several shōen during the Heian period, largely under the control of the Fujiwara clan or the Taira clan.  However, in the Kamakura period, parts of the territory came under the control of the Jōdo Shinshū sect, who challenged the secular authority of the various samurai clans, most notably the Matsudaira clan.  During the Sengoku period, numerous fortifications were erected in the area. Tokugawa Ieyasu unified the region and destroyed the power of the Jōdo Shinshū sect in the Battle of Azukizaka (1564).  During the Edo period, half of present-day Anjō was controlled by Okazaki Domain and the other half by Kariya Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate with some scattered portions of tenryō territory ruled directly by the shogunate. During this period, the area was noted for its production of cotton and textiles.
At the start of the Meiji period, on October 1, 1889, Anjō was one of a collection of villages organized within Hekikai District, Aichi Prefecture by the establishment of the modern municipalities system,. It was elevated to town status on May 1, 1906. The opening of the Meiji Irrigation Canal transformed the area in the 1920s and 1930s into one of the most agriculturally productive regions of the period, sparking the comparison with Denmark, then regarded the most highly advanced agricultural nation in the world. This led to Anjō's moniker of "Japan's Denmark" (日本デンマーク), which remains in the form of Den Park, a Danish theme park, as well as Den Beer, a microbrew available in the park.
Anjō was elevated to city status on May 3, 1952. On April 1, 1967, it annexed the neighboring town of Sakura.

Anjō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 28 members. The city contributes two members to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly.
