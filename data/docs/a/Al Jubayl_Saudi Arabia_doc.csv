Jubail (Arabic: الجبيل‎, Al Jubayl) is a city in the Eastern province on the Arabian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia. It is home to the largest industrial city in the world. It is also home to the Middle East's largest and world's fourth largest petrochemical company SABIC. It has the world's largest IWPP (Independent Water and Power Project) producing 2743.6 MW of electricity and 800,000 m3 of water daily. Jubail comprises the Old Town of Al Jubail (Jubail Balad), which was a small fishing village until 1975 and the new industrial area. Jubail Industrial City is the largest civil engineering project in the world today.
In 1975, the Saudi government designated Jubail as the site for a new industrial city, with rapid expansion and industrialization arising. The new industrial and residential areas were named Madīnat al Jubayl aṣ Ṣinā`īyah (Jubail Industrial City). The 2005 Census Report for Jubail Industrial City estimates the population at 224,430 residents.


== History ==
The town of Al-Jubail, on the Persian Gulf coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has ancient roots. Human habitation dates back at least 7,000 years, when the people of Dilmun — whose civilization radiated up and down the coast of the Persian Gulf — established a settlement there.
In September 1933, Jubail gained a measure of fame as the landing site for the first team of geologists to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia.


== Jubail Industrial City ==

It is the World's Largest Industrial City established in 1975. It  covers 1,016 square kilometers and includes industrial complexes, major harbour and port facilities. It contributes to about 7% of Saudi Arabia's GDP.Bechtel began work on the Jubail Industrial City project more than 40 years ago and is still working in Jubail now. Bechtel has managed the Jubail project since it began in the mid-1970s, and in 2004 the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu asked the company to manage Jubail II, a $3.8 billion expansion of the city's industrial and residential areas.


== Transportation ==


=== Highway ===
Jubail is directly connected with other cities by two major highways; Dhahran-Jubail Highway and Abu Hadriyah Highway.
One ongoing project is the Jubail-Qassim (Buraidah) Expressway 500 km (310 mi), which will reduce the distance between Jubail and Qassim (Buraidah) to around 331 km (206 mi) from the current 831 km (516 mi).


=== Railway ===
A branch of the Saudi Landbridge Project railway is proposed to connect Jubail to Dammam.


=== Seaport ===
There are two seaports in Jubail—the Jubail Commercial Seaport and the King Fahd Industrial Seaport. As of 2011, Jubail ranks 92nd in the world in terms of Total Cargo Volume with 44,700 tons.


=== Airport ===
The city is served by King Fahd International Airport.
Jubail Airport is an airfield 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Jubail City, near the industrial area. Originally constructed by the Royal Commission of Jubail and Yanbu as part of Jubail project, it was meant to be used for commercial aviation until it was decided to utilize the large nearby King Fahd International Airport. Thus, it was handed over to the Ministry of Defence and has been used as a base for the naval aviation group/eastern fleet of the Royal Saudi Navy since then. The terminal in Dammam Airport is about 60 km drive from the suburbs of Jubail, 80 km from the city center and 100 km from the Royal Commission neighborhoods. 
However it was recently announced that the airport will be opened for private aviation operations starting September 2014. A  project to renovate the airfield was undertaken since some of the airfield's infrastructure was incomplete, as a result of the previous change for the use of airport from commercial to military. To date, the project and renovations have not been completed.
In addition, two other airfields are located in the city; Abu Ali Airport is located in the Island of Abu Ali while the other is located in King Abdulaziz Naval Base.
