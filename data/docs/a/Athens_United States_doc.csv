The chancery building in Athens was designed by famed Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius with consulting architect Pericles A. Sakellarios. It was constructed between 1959 and 1961 and is a protected architectural landmark. Gropius' famous design was in the characteristic simple Bauhaus form, inspired by the architecture of the Parthenon.In 2003, the U.S. Embassy and the Athens Municipality celebrated the addition of a welcoming green space, the Makedonon Street Park. The landscaping of this pedestrian walkway was prompted by heightened security requirements.In 2007, an office building, parking garage, compound entrances, fuel station, Marine Corps Security Guard quarters, swimming pool, and basketball court were completed. The design of the new office building is intended to integrate well with the chancery, as well as with the Megaron Mousikis (Athens Concert Hall) next door. The new office building enabled the embassy to bring onto the compound employees who have been working in leased space for many years.
The office building is 5026 m2 and includes office space for over 150 people.
