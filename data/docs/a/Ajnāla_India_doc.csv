== Historical importance of the town and monuments sites ==


=== Indian Rebellion of 1857 ===
During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 282 sepoys of the 26th Native Infantry mutinied at Lahore and subsequently surrendered, believing they were going to be given a fair trial. They were summarily executed without trial by Frederick Henry Cooper, then–deputy commissioner of the district. The bodies were dumped into a deep dry well near the police station which was later filled with charcoal, lime, and dirt. The 26th Native Infantry was made up entirely of Sikhs and the British made it a point to order Sikh soldiers to shoot the Sikh mutineers, to prevent religious tensions between communities of natives and between the natives and colonizers.[3] In March 2014 the head of a local Sikh gurdwara announced that the remains of those buried had been uncovered in the excavation of a well within the shrine.[4] The well is known as Shaheedan da Khu in local Punjabi dialect, which means "the black well".
