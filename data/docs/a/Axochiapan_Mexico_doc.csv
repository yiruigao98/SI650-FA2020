== Etymology & Shield ==
The origin of Axochiapan's name comes from "axochi-tl", which means “water flower or water lily”. This comes from the many white lilies that form like carpets on the ponds and lakes in the area. The shield's appearance is due to the water lilies that are prevalent in the area. Its peeking out of the water conveys how, just like in real life, they rapidly grow and reproduce in water, particularly during the month of August.


== History ==
Axochiapan is a city with ancient Olmec and Tlahuican origins. They were dominated by the Aztec Empire. With the Spanish conquest, the village stopped paying tribute to the Aztec Empire and came under the rule of the Spanish Crown.Axochiapan belonged to the municipality of Jonacatepec from 1824 to 1869. Later, the State of Morelos was created, which also created the municipality of Tetelilla. From 1869 to 1898, Axochiapan belonged to Tetelilla until it finally became its own municipality on November 9, 1898, covering territory that previously belonged to Tetelilla (with exception to a city which was integrated with Jonacatepec). Axochiapan's first town hall was installed and the town's first mayor, Luis G. Rebolledo, assumed office at that time.A number of citizens from Axochiapan joined the fight during the Mexican Revolution, including Joaquín Camaño, Marcelino Rodríguez, Marcelino Vergara, Benigno Abundes, and José Palma.The epicenter of the September 19, 2017 earthquake was 7.5 miles southeast of Axochiapan. Four people in the municipality were killed. The Secretary of Health reported that 243 homes were destroyed and 1,161 were damaged in the municipality.Felix Sanchez Espinoza of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018.While the state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020, no cases were reported in Axochiapan.

== Connections to the Mexican Revolution ==
Axochiapan was not untouched during the Mexican Revolution. Members from the Liberation Army of the South such as Alejandro Casales, Joaquín Caamaño, Marcelino Rodríguez, Marcelino Vergara, Benigno Abundes, and José Palma had connections to the city.General Alejandro Casales was one of the most important leaders during the Mexican Revolution. He fought in rebel operations in Morelos and helped organize peasant resistance. On March 11, 1911, peasants in Morelos took up arms in Ayala. Directed by Pablo Torres Burgos, they headed south to take Tlalquiltenango and Jojutla. When Burgos failed to control his men, he resigned from their command. After he left, he was captured and executed by his enemies. This left Casales to organize the soldiers. Soon, forces under the command of Morelos Cuernavaca and the 18th regiment under the control of Colonel Javier Rojas began to search for Casales. It wasn't long before the 18th Regiment found Casales. He fought heroically all day until he was finally caught and burned alive. However, he had left Axochiapan organized to be the background for a new municipality.General José Palma was born in Axochiapan; in 1911 he joined the Zapatista movement.

He was an officer under the orders of General Francisco Mendoza, acting as the head of his escorts and later as the colonel of his own guerrilla group.General Benigno Abundes was from Axochiapan. He fought under the orders of General Lorenzo Vázquez. On August 30, 1911, when Emiliano Zapata broke with the group, Abundes took control of his troops. He continued battling in Tilzapotla, Los Hornos, Nexpa, Quetzalpa, Chaucingo. and San Miguel in the state of Guerrero.Joaquín Camaño Pérez was born in Axochiapan in 1887. Joaquín was the son of Martín Camaño and Petra García Sánchez. He began fighting at a very young age because he was angered by injustice.
