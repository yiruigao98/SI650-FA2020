== History ==
Situated in the Northern Paraná region, was born by the Company's initiative to Northlands Paraná, pioneered the settlement of the region. As well as the cities founded by the company, had all its development based on a master plan. Its creator and founder was William da Fonseca Brabason Davids, director of Northlands Company of Paraná, which at the time of Arapongas Foundation held the post of Mayor of Londrina. In 1935, the French dealer René Cellot and her daughter Jeanine Cellot bought the first lots of land, intended for urban construction. Thus, on 28 September 1935, Rene Cellot and her daughter settled with a home business in the same place where today is the building of Banco Bradesco S / A (former Brazilian Discount Bank S / A), the av. Spies. In the same year it opened and sold the first lot to the Brazilian agricultural farmer Floriano Freire. Immediately, several other farmers, from different nationalities, have taken up residence in the place and settled down with trading houses.
In the following years were populated the plots intended for colonies formed by Japanese and Slavic immigrants, coming thus in 1937, the Colonies Orleans Hope and already populated, which greatly contributed to the progress and expansion of new equity.
Spies remained part of the municipality of Londrina until 1943, when it was created the municipality of Rolândia, which happened to belong, by the way as judicial district, created by Law No. 199 of 30 December 1943, which It approved the new administrative division of Paraná, to take effect in the 1943–1947 five-year period. Due to lack of transport, the district grew slowly, this problem is further aggravated due to restrictions motivated by World War II. Under these conditions, by the year 1945, the district headquarters had about 600 houses and was served by the then Road São Paulo-Parana Iron, who shortly after was built, to become part of the heritage of Paraná Traffic Network – Santa Catarina. Nevertheless, the people of Arapongas continued to fight bravely for their progress and well-being, getting to be an entity with the name of the Society of Friends of Arapongas to strive for their independence, progress and development. And so, as a result of these efforts, the State Government, by Law No. 2 of 10 October 1947, creating the city of Arapongas dismembering him Rolândia and raising its headquarters to a city.
That time, the city had a total area of 2007 square kilometers and consisted of administrative districts of the municipal seat, Astorga and Sabáudia.
A few days after the publication of Law No. 2 of 10 October 1947, he was sworn in as interim Mayor Joseph Simonetti which remained until the inauguration of the first elected mayor, Julio Junqueira, on November 9, 1947, by a coalition of parties opposition. Possession of Julius Junqueira took place thirty days after the election.
The first mayor faced several political problems and even revoked his mandate, that is delivered through a skillful political maneuvering. On January 16, 1948 was installed the region, created just before, in the category of first indentation, and two years later was elevated directly to the rank of third indentation. The first was Judge Ismael Dorneles de Freitas, and the first public prosecutor was Marcolino Leite de Paula e Silva. On July 22, 1951 was elected Mayor John Cernichiaro, which like its predecessor struggled with serious problems of political order. Yet Arapongas continued to progress. In this period he started the paving of the city's public parks; generates the set of City Hall; opened several roads and created numerous city schools.
Twice we had John Cernichiaro ordered the forfeiture of his mandate, and twice two Presidents of the City Council tried to take over the duties of the Mayor, only not succeeding because of the boldness and bravery of the Mayor who resisted even the strength to maneuver Town Council. Finally, using the higher court, John Cernichiaro had won the case, continue in power until the end of his term. In 1952, the first newspaper in the city of Arapongas District 'was inaugurated by Ennio Prosdocimi. Spies missed the territory of Astorga district, which was dismembered and transformed into autonomous municipality. The measure implemented by the state government had no good effect, so much so that the twenty councilors who sit on the City Council, five resigned his mandate in protest. In 1954, the city suffered another break up, with the creation of Sabáudia municipality, the old district of the territory of the same name. With this loss, the municipality reduced the district area and district headquarters.
Notwithstanding the territorial losses, Arapongas turned out to demonstrate entrepreneurial dynamism above the regional average, been developing an extensive industrial park furniture and gifts, today is an important furniture manufacturing hub for the rest of southern Brazil. This happened after the 1970s, when the sudden collapse of the coffee crop in northern Paraná due to heavy frost forced the region's cities to seek new economic basis. The low-cost furniture industry, especially upholstery, soon proved a path with great potential to expand consumption, which led to a proliferation of companies in a well-designed (and pioneer in the region) industrial park. In this sector, the Arapongas polo eventually rivaling the furniture industry in Curitiba, this more traditional but very based on handmade carpentry and therefore less competitive. This industrialization process is the basis of population and economic growth of the city, which is gradually enhancing their commercial and service sectors, occupying virtually equivalent position to Apucarana in the region.
