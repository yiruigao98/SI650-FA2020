Ayamonte (Spanish pronunciation: [aʝaˈmonte]) (in Portuguese Aiamonte) is a town and municipality located in the province of Huelva, (Spain) near the Portugal–Spain border on the Guadiana River. According to the 2015 census, the city had a population of 20,357 inhabitants.


== Location and history ==
The township of Ayamonte preserves its old medieval quarter in the central district of the town, with many very narrow streets and historical buildings; this central area is a designated car-free zone.
For centuries the ferry link between Ayamonte and Vila Real de Santo António was the traditional crossing point between Spain and Portugal. A modern bridge over the Guadiana River has now been built to the north of the town, linking the motorway systems of the two countries, but the ferry still runs and provides an inexpensive mode of transport between the two countries.
The beach area of Ayamonte is Isla Canela and is reached by a causeway across the Marismas del Guadiana; the marismas (salt marshes) are an important wildlife reserve, providing a home to many waterfowl, including herons and flamingos. Isla Canela is built along several kilometers of sandy beaches, and provides an ideal area for windsurfing, kitesurfing and sailing. There are a number of quality golf courses in and around the area, including one built into the Marismas itself.
The city, is also famous for his local festivities, the "Fiestas de las Angústias" in honor of their patron "Nuestra Señora de las Angústias". The festivities in the beginning of September are a moment of celebration not only from the Ayamontin population, but also for many Andalucians, and Portuguese. The festivities are graced by the local band, "Banda Ciudad de Ayamonte" and the Portuguese "Banda da Sociedade Filarmónica Progresso e Labor Samouquense" from the Portuguese village of Samouco.
The Costa Esuri development is just to the north of Ayamonte. It was an ambitious development built by the Galicia-based developer Martinsa-Fadesa that stalled as a result of the global financial crisis of 2007–08. Many properties were left unfinished, but because of the steep reduction in price, the development is starting to have the success that was always expected. The development features two golf courses, though only the west course is open. A hotel that was planned remains unfinished.
