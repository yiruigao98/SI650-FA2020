== History of Zubair ==


=== Early history ===
The city was named al-Zubair because one of the Sahaba (companions) of the Prophet Muhammad, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, was buried there.


=== Recent history ===
During the Ottoman times, the city was a self-ruling Sheikhdom ruled by a Sheikh from Najdi families, such as Al Zuhair, Al Meshry, and Al Rashed families. Like other Sheikdoms under the Ottoman Empire, the Sheikdom of Zubair used to pay dues and receive protection from the Ottomans. In the 19th century, the city of Zubair witnessed relatively large migrations from Najd. Up until the 1970s and 1980s, the town was predominantly populated by people of who moved to Najed. Now only a few families remain of the old inhabitants. Most of them moved back to Najd and other regions of Saudi Arabia  Al Saud came form here, and to Kuwait. In the period when Najdis inhabited the city it was dominated by the Sunni denomination of Islam, unlike the mixed Shia - Sunni Basra nearby.


=== 21st century ===
By 2008, the city of Zubair had a population of around 240,000 people and had grown to merge into the Basra metropolitan area with nearly 3 million inhabitants in total. As in Basra, the municipality of Zubair currently has a Shia majority and is barely distinguishable from Basra itself. But, contrary to Basra, Zubair is still home to a large Sunni minority. However, they have faced violence from Shia militants, and many have fled to Gulf countries and Sunni areas of Iraq.
