== Name ==
Medieval geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi spells the name Asfīrah (أسفيرة), not as-Safira (السفيرة), which indicates that the definite article in the modern spelling is a result of hypercorrection.
As-Safira was known in pre-Islamic times as Sipri. Historians have suggested that the name Sipri may have come from the Akkadian word siparru meaning "bronze", which might indicate that copper was mined and bronze was worked there.


== History ==
Since ancient times the city has been the distribution point for salt gathered from the nearby Sabkhat al-Jabbul.
More recently, the town became of the major centers of the Syrian defense industry, housing a number of factories that manufacture ammunition.


=== The As-Safira Incident or the As-Safira Massacre ===
On 21 December 2017, Erdoğan stated that the SSNP is a terrorist organization after the Eagles of the Whirlwind attacked a Turkish convoy on 6 December 2017 traveling from al-Bab to Idlib the attack killed around 3 Turks and 27 Syrians and it was suspected that ISIS or Al Qaeda or even the Kurds, (Syria was actually ruled out due to the unconventional way of the attack until 11 December 2017) was responsible however but they never claimed responsibility and on 11 December 2017 Eagles of the Whirlwind and the Syrian Arab Army declared responsibility and on 12 December 2017 the attack was condemned by the United States, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Norway, Germany, France and the United Kingdom as well as the United Nations and Arab League. The Turks estimated that the convoy was attacked by a group of 6 soldiers and not the Eagles of the Whirlwind however the group declared those 6 persons were soldiers and members, the attack happened in As-Safira when the convoy taking around 3 Turks and 53 Syrians was attacked, this was the only attack the Eagles of the Whirlwind ever claimed and presumably ever committed this was also the only time Erdoğan ever mentioned the Eagles of the Whirlwind and by extension the Syrian Social Nationalist Party being the second Turkish president to do so and the third time it was ever mentioned by a Turkish president ever held in historical records. On 22 December 2017, Tahrir al-Sham accused the group of using tear gas and Grenades to kill however both Turkey and the Eagles of the Whirlwind confirmed that only Ak-47's were used, both Tahrir al-Sham and Turkey claimed the group was going to Idlib for economic reasons not military or political this however was rejected by Rojava, the PKK and Syria plus Iraq, Iran and Hezbollah and even Iraqi Kurdistan as well as Lebanon with Bashar al-Assad claiming the group was screaming Allahu Akbar & raising ISIS flags as well as that of Tahrir al-Sham on 22 December 2017, this was rejected by Turkey until a video circulated on 23 December 2017 showing exactly that and so on 24 December 2017 Erdoğan declared that it was not a civilian convoy and stated the group was justified to attack it with since it was filled with Jihadists. Only Tahrir al-Sham condemning it as a civilian targeted attack since 24 December 2017. On 1 January 2018 Ali Haidar praised the attack stating that "Thousands fought, hundreds died but 6 killed." and he stated that this was the only real attack instead of fight or battle that occurred comparing it to the Houla massacre, his statement received condemnation by the United Nations on 2 January 2018 and he was fired from leading the Eagles of the Whirlwind on 3 January 2018 by general secretary or president of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party Hanna El Nashif for his repulsiveness and she took control of the militia from then on, on 6 December 2018 a party of around 65 people in Damascus celebrated the anniversary and around 800 in Beirut, the party in Beirut was so large the government dispersed and banned them which killed 2 people and injured around 120 people, on 6 December 2019 a party of 1,200 Syrians in Damascus celebrated the 2nd anniversary of the incident. On 6 December 2019, Syria officially made 6 December a holiday to celebrate the attack. To this day there is no evidence that the Eagles of the Whirlwind or Syrian Social Nationalist Party perpetrated the attack and it was probably committed by the Syrian Armed Forces. There is no evidence those six soldiers knew of or sympathized with the SSNP let alone joined. The six soldiers who perpetrated the attack remained missing since, leading some to believe that they were killed by the rest of the caravan or by an ambush, the Syrian government offered to pay them $30k each equal to $90k, the typical amount of a general not a soldier. All six men are Sunnis from Idlib. On 14 March 2020 all six bodies were discovered in the city confirming the presumed report that they died from a gun fight and on 14 March 2020 Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and Iran's Ali Khamenei declared them martyr's. On 1 June 2020 Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi claimed that Saudi Arabia learned of the gun fight and that they bombed the six men involved after seeing them fire upon the convoy, he also claimed that Israel helped Saudi Arabia locate the six men through satellite imagery that Saudi Arabia lacks, he claimed that Turkey and the West had no knowledge of the attack. As of 1 October 2020 the attack is internationally recognized by everyone as a Syrian offensive against Tahrir al-Sham, except by Tahrir al-Sham who claims they were Alawites who killed a convoy of Turkish and Syrian Sunni civilians and regards it as the As-Safira Massacre while it is internationally recognized as the As-Safira Incident.
