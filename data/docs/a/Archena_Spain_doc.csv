Archena is home to a hot water mineral spa dating back to Roman times and has 3 hotels built around it.  Whilst undergoing recent development, further Roman ruins were found on the site of the spa.


== Etymology ==
The etymology of the word "Archena" is indisputably somehow related to the Indo-European root referring to "water" that appears in Arga, Erga, Arganzuela, etc., and, within the territory of Murcia, with the Argos river, Archena, Archivel, etc. The origin of the word "Archena" derives from Latin arxila, which means clay, but over the years it turned into "Archena".


== History ==


=== Roman Times ===

Although the village of Archena was created in the Bronze Age, the Romans were the ones who founded the town in the 1st and 2nd centuries. This is shown in the archeological remains of the therms in Archena's water spa. The Romans created around this place temples, lodges, paths and roads connected with the rest of Hispania.


=== 17th century ===
With the conquest of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, the Christian Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula ended. Like the rest of the Kingdom of Murcia and the territories of the Iberian Peninsula, the seventeenth century is a period of crisis for Archena for several reasons. This century saw a demographic increase and a development of the cultivated surface, being rice, corn, oil and barley the most important productions at that time. Later, a demographic decrease was magnified by a series of catastrophes that devastated the region: floods, droughts, locust plagues, earthquakes and plagues.


=== 18th century ===
The 18th century was a period of stability and economic progress for all the country, especially for the Murcia's area. The Ricote Valley and Archena were the zones with the greatest population growth.
In this century Archena suffered negative economic effects since a company of French troops remained stationed there, which meant a high cost to the town. However, the century of the Enlightenment is for the municipality the beginning of an upward trajectory from the demographic point of view, which lasts until today.


=== 19th century ===
The Independence War caused a deep wear in the ”Balneario”. Later, a period of political instability and civil conflict started. With the definitive victory of liberalism, the Ancien Régime’s abolition was produced. The political and social tensions which the Restauration pretended to hide, burst uncontrollably in the second decade of the 20th century and finished in the long Civil War.


=== 20th century ===
Archena had got a little sanatorium thanks to Mr. Mario Spreáfico, a doctor who helped poor people for free. Archena had also got the figure of Vicente Medina, a great naturalist poet who spent most of his life away from the village but who loved and appreciated its orchards.The trade, the agriculture and the industry prospered. In the first years of the century, the factory “Molinos del río” was set up.  The apricot was the most important fruit but, in general, there was also an important production of citrus. Nowadays, there are some chimneys left as a trace of this industrial activity.


==== Spanish Civil War ====

During the Spanish Civil War, two military bases were established in Archena: a Russian air base a police station and tank school in the “Balneario” and Military Hospital.
The Military Command settled in the Miguel Medina school.  Archena didn't suffer attacks during the war, but suffered the long and hard postwar. The battle reduced the development again, returning to a subsistence production. After the war, life conditions were very hard, with the decrease of the salaries and the subsequent famines.
The repression included some murders and the harassment of many people (women, children...), and meant the prison for the republicans. In April, 1939 the municipal officials were destituted.


==== Second half of the century ====
After the Spanish Civil War, the “Virgen de la Salud” and the “Corpus Christi” were turned into patron saints of Archena. By the thirties of the 20th century, in Archena there was a population of 7.771, in spite of the emigration to France or Barcelona, which lasted until the eighties when, with the prosperity of the economy, some emigrants returned. From that time on, the population in Archena started to grow.On September 1, 1963, there was an explosion of an ammunition depot at the distance of one kilometer from the village. Nowadays, people in Archena celebrate that there weren't any deaths or wounds.In 1975, when the dictator Francisco Franco died, a term of politic transition started. In this period, the government created new schools, health, cultural and sports installations.


=== 21st century ===
Thanks to archaeological excavations in 2001, a cave was found dating back to c.2300 BC, in Copper Age, used by a community of 23 people.
On September 11, 2012, the 550th anniversary of Archena's township was celebrated. On September 11, 1462, the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem signed the municipal charter with a few villagers; these people reached the independence of Archena as a municipality with the constitution of the first local government and the first mayor.
The church of the Corpus Christi-La Purísima was created in 2001 thanks to a priest of the church San Juan Bautista, D. Cristóbal Guerrero Ros. He said that Archena needed a second church and with the support of some people, he collected money for the construction. On May 31, 2001, Cristobal Guerrero Ros was named “adopted son of the village”. On April 26, 2010, he received a tribute.A group of ruins have been found in the spa thanks to the construction of the new parking. Since then, the spa management has found Roman columns in the thermal gallery. Moreover, Roman ruins of buildings have appeared in the pool area, where what today would have been a hotel. There is a museum to save these ruins.
