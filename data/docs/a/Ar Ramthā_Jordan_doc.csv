=== Prehistory ===
The stable climate in ar-Ramtha and its surrounding areas attracted many animals to live in neighborhood of ar-Ramtha, as well the simple conditions for managing a stable long life there attracted humans to make those regions their earliest choices to gather in groups of hunters and to live in rocky caves. Artifacts and graves in the area show that ar-Ramtha has been inhabited since the Bronze Age (even earlier), but the lack of study of the region gives us no exact information about when humans had selected the land for living.

The Roman Empire utilized ar-Ramtha as a remote hub to cross-link their colonies. The ruins of buildings and ancient Roman antiquities have been discovered at different parts of ar-Ramtha.

Historically and sociologically, the city is the twin to Daraa city in Syria, which is located on just the other side of the border.
