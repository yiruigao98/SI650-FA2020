Brazil has a high level of urbanization with 87.8% of the population residing in urban and metropolitan areas. The criteria used by the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) in determining whether households are urban or rural, however, are based on political divisions, not on the developed environment.
Nowadays, the country has more than 5,570 municipalities.The state capitals are all the largest cities in their respective states, with the only exceptions being Florianópolis (which is the capital and the second largest city of Santa Catarina after Joinville) and Vitória (which is the capital but only the fourth-largest city of Espírito Santo, though it is located in that state's largest metropolitan area).


== Most populated cities in Brazil ==
This is a list of the most populous cities based on the population of the municipality where the city is located, rather than its metropolitan area. As IBGE considers the entire Federal District synonymous to Brasília, the population of the Federal District is shown for Brasília.
