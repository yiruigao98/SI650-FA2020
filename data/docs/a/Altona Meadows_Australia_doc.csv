== Politics ==
Altona Meadows falls within the federal electorate of Gellibrand (currently held by the ALP's Tim Watts), the state electorate of Altona, as well as the local Council area of the City of Hobsons Bay.
Typically for a working-class western suburb of Melbourne, it has consistently been a very safe area for the ALP. However, as new housing estates have been established within the area and it becomes increasingly middle-class, it witnessed some larger-than-average swings towards the Liberals during the Howard years (despite remaining solidly Labor).
Two citizens from Altona Meadows started the Gamers United Party, which became popular online and has a global audience.
