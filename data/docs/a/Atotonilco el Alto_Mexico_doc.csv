== History ==
The town was first established by the Purépecha in late 1400, according to Purépecha myth. The region was conquered in June 1530 by the Nuño de Guzmán. Martin del Campo was the first encomendero and the evangelization of the region was entrusted to the Franciscans. Atotonilco in 1551 was given in encomienda to the conquistador Andrés de Villanueva. In November 1824 the State Congress ruled that the village of Atotonilco hereafter would have the title of town, and would also be the head of the department which includes Arandas and Ayotlán. On May 15, 1868, the governor of Jalisco, Antonio Gómez Cuervo, elevated the status of Atotonilco to a city, which it retains to this day.
