Allauch (Alaug in Occitan; French pronunciation: ​[alo]) is a French commune situated east of Marseille in the department of Bouches-du-Rhône in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of France.
The inhabitants of the commune are known as Allaudiens or Allaudiennes.


== Geography ==


=== Location ===
Allauch is the capital of the Canton of Bouches-du-Rhône. It is a part of the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis.
The commune had 19,521 inhabitants at the 2010 census.
It is located 12 km north-east of Marseille, 10 km north-east of Aubagne and 35 km south of Aix-en-Provence. Access to the commune is by the D908 road from Marseille in the south-west passing through the commune and continuing north to join the D96 north of La Bouilladisse. Access to the village is by the D48 branching off the D908 and looping back as the D48A. There is also the D4A road from the 11th arrondissement in the south, and the D44G from the 12th arrondissement in the south-west.As Allauch is located on the edge of the Marseille conurbation there are numerous urban districts located within the commune. These are:


=== Neighbouring communes and villages ===


=== Urbanism ===
'Allauch Village is located on the north-eastern fringe of the Marseille conurbation with large parts of the west of the commune also forming part of this conurbation joining with Plan-de-Cuques to the west..
Allauch is separated from Mimet by the massif of l'Étoile, resulting in it being necessary to detour to Cadolive in order to go from Allauch to Mimet. Similarly it is separated from the Aubagne urban area by the Garlaban hills to the south-east. Apart from the urban area in the west of the commune, the rest is heavily forested and mountainous.


=== Housing ===
Each year Allauch pays about €200,000 for missing social housing in order to reach the 20% required by the Urban Renewal Law (SRU). According to the commune however, available land is limited: of the 5,032 hectares of the commune a total of 4,000 is conservation land, 500 are already urbanized and the balance is sometimes affected by risks (flooding, collapse, fire, etc.). Recent increases in the price of land suitable for building has resulted in increasing difficulties in growing the social housing stock.
The City Council has decided that each construction project should have between 20% and 30% social housing. The first obstacle is that the commune owns little suitable land in built-up areas to build social housing (near schools, shops, services, transport, etc. to avoid creating "ghettos"). The value of the land is very high and the commune must sell land to social housing operators at well below the actual value. Furthermore, the municipality must guarantee 50% of the borrowings and contribute financially up to €20,000 per unit. The procedures are slow and it can take 3 or 4 years from the sales agreement and delivery of the first housing.
Another obstacle is that, in 2006, 108 applications for social housing (Social Housing loans) were made by the commune but only 48 were granted by the urban community to which the state has delegated its powers, while the State requires the construction of 64 units per year.
According to the Abbe Pierre Foundation for Disadvantaged Housing, of 319 housing units the commune should have built between 2002 and 2006 it has neither built nor funded any, something that Allaudiens were far from disapproving having re-elected the Povinelli list of candidates by 81.15% in the local elections in 2008.
The commune may have another opportunity to fulfil its obligation by purchasing existing housing through preemption to transform social housing.

Weather Data for Allauch


== History ==
One of the objects found in the Baume Sourno Cave (dark cave) may have been used as a wedding gift for the young Gyptis. The history of Marseille has a story that Marseille was born from the union of a handsome Greek sailor and the daughter of King Nann, the chief of a Ligurian tribe around the year 600 BC However, historians believe that Allauch was the chief town of a Ligurian tribe called ségobrige. The beautiful Gyptis could have been allaudienne and Marseille girl from Allauch. In Provence and in Allauch in particular people like legends.
A Coat of Arms has been bequeathed to the commune from being the seat for the Saracens: in the 10th century the Moors besieged the village. At the brink of starvation the villagers, to deceive the enemy, sent twenty loaves and their remaining spear points. The Saracens were discouraged, imagining that abundance reigned behind the walls. They broke camp. It was night and the moon was in its last quarter with three stars shone around it. So the arms of Allauch have three stars, a crescent moon, and two silver wings (arrow quills).
Under the auspices of the canons of the Cathedral de la Major Marseille, the castle was built in the 12th century. There remains a postern, some ramparts, and Our Lady of the Castle which was built in 1148 . The pride of Allauch, it is still a place of worship and pilgrimage. The canons remained the Spiritual and Temporal Lords for nearly seven centuries until the French Revolution. They attracted a new population seeking land to cultivate. Then began a period of clearing the land and covering it with vineyards, olive groves, and wheat.
On the eve of the Revolution more than three-quarters of Allauch soil belonged to the peasants who worked it, about 20% by the nobles and bourgeois, and only 3% by the clergy. Throughout the 19th century Allauch declined: Agriculture and livestock stagnated as did the production of plaster and chalk extracted using traditional methods.
In contrast to the early 19th century, during the suppression of the free port of Marseille, Allauch was the scene of contraband tobacco. Probably practiced initially by only a few it soon became generalized and became the main industry of Allauch during the century ahead of the stone quarries, the plasterworks, and the bauxite deposits.
The construction of the Canal de Marseille started a recovery: running water arrived in Allauch in 1888. Then an electric tram line connecting Marseille to Plan-de-Cuques came in 1902 followed by a connection to Bourdonnière and Allauch via Pounche in 1908: it was the end of isolation and confirmation of a new prosperity to come.
In the Decree of 25 March 1966 Allauch was classed as an urban commune and today Allauch has become increasingly a residential commune.

=== Quality of life ===
In the 1960s a study by Agam predicted population figures of 60 to 80,000 in Allauch in 2000. Today the commune has about 20,000 inhabitants. This is the result of political will of the various mayors who have never ceased to protect the hills, to restrict urbanisation, and contained demographic change.According to the municipality, Allauch is an "art town" of greenery on the outskirts of Marseille with two-thirds of its territory consisting of hills while of the 119 communes in the department Allauch came 22nd highest for the housing tax (19.71% municipal rate in 2007) and 6th highest for the property tax (33.24% municipal rate in 2007).The politics of the commune management of land use plan has both limited building areas in order not to distort the landscape and allowed only normal sized housing so that there would be sound economic development respecting the environment and refusing any infrastructure that denaturalises Allauch (highways, supermarkets, industries creating nuisances etc.) and saving natural areas and green belts.
There is in place a protection service for the hills with an annual budget of €350,000 (15 water tanks, 2,000 hours annually to monitor the start of any fires), clearing obligations, and reforestation.In the vote on joining the Urban Community of Marseille Provence Métropole, Allauch commune voted against for fear of no longer having a voice regarding the land use plan. The joining of the urban community in 2000 may have reduced the decision-making powers of the commune in urban planning matters, highways, or street cleanliness by moving the decision-making centre but will perhaps achieve the construction of a school ijn Allauch.


=== Twinning ===

Allauch has twinning associations with:
 Vaterstetten (Germany) since 1982. A Bavarian town near Munich: twice a year the Twinning Committee exchanges guests with matching German hosts and provides accommodation with allaudienne families during visits to the region and events where the two communities meet. Each year on the last Saturday of August is the beer festival hosted by an orchestra and a Bavarian dance evening in which everyone can sing, dance and enjoy good sauerkraut. The Feast of Saint Nicolas is aimed at young people. In July a trip is organized to Vaterstetten for Allaudiens to the Christmas market in the town to sell Provençal products.
 Vico Equense (Italy) since 2004. Near Naples: throughout the year Bella Italia organizes events for the Italian community in Allauch such as Italian evenings (dinner dance with live music and an Italian singer), bingo, trips (Ventimiglia, South of Italy etc.)
 Affula (Israel) since 1995.
