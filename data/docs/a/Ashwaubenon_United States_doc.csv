== History ==
The U.S. military bought most of the west side of Green Bay, Wisconsin from the Sioux in the 1850s and 1860s, except the area that would later become Ashwaubenon. That land belonged to two daughters of Chief Ashwaubamy, a Sioux chief. They began selling their land to local farmers and landowners in the late 19th century. One of the owners was Jacques Vieau.


=== Name origin ===
One theory of the origins of Ashwaubenon is of Ojibwe origin. It is derived from ashiwabiwining "place where they watch, keep a lookout". Another theory derives the name from Chief Ashwaubamay.
