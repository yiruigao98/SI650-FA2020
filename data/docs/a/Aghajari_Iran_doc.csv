Aghajari (Persian: آغاجاری‎, also Romanized as Āghājārī and Āghā Jārī; also known as Aghajari-e Zeydūn and Āqā Jarī) is a city and capital of Central District, in Aghajari County, Khuzestan Province, Iran.  At the 2006 census, its population was 13,152, in 2,943 families. Because of the Iran-Iraq War the city's population dropped from 64,102 in 1986 to around 16,337 in the 1991 census and its population continued to drop long after the 1991 census (held 3 years after the end of the Iran-Iraq War), but according to World Gazetteer the population has slowly grown to 15,153 in 2012, meaning the city's population is extremely far from reaching or getting close to its 1986 population.


== Etymology ==
The name is the corrupted version of the Turkic aghach ari, ("woodman"), a reminder of the time when the now-Luri-speaking Boyer-Ahmadis, still living nearby, spoke a Turkic dialect, imparting one of their tribal names: (Aghachari) to the town.
"aghach ari" now turns into (probably) "agac ari" which in Turkish language means "tree-bee"


== Climate ==
Aghajari has a desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with long, very hot summers and mild, short winters.
