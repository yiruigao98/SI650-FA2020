Better transport connections, including two stations on the Valencia metro system : Alboraia-Palmaret and Alboraia-Peris Aragó), urban exodus from the Valencia, and foreign immigration have increased the population from 11,267 in 1986, to an estimated 23,572 individuals in 2014. Of these, 58.84% declared themselves to be Valencian speakers.

The remaining seats were won by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) (5), Unión Popular de Alboraya (3), Coalició Compromís (3) and Ciudadanos por Alboraya (Citizens for Alboraya) (2) Subsequently, a coalition of everyone but the PP was formed, with Miguel Chavarria becoming the first PSOE Mayor since 1999.Traditional crops are based on irrigated, intensive farming.
