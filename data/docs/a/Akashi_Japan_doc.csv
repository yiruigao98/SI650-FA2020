== History ==
Akashi was an important city during Japan's pre-modern period due to the presence of Akashi Castle, headquarters of the Akashi Domain. The city, in its current form, was founded on November 1, 1919.
Akashi city was called Akashi Domain (1617-1871) and flourished as an old castle town since the seventeenth century. After the time of the Meiji restoration, the abolition of the han system (haihan-chiken) was done and replaced to a new system of prefectures in 1871 by Meiji Government.
It was said that Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) who was one of the well-known Japanese swordsmen made the old town's lots in the seventeenth century. Kakinomotono Hitomaro who was the great waka poet of the late Asuka period wrote many poems, and one of them was about Akashi. Akashi also appeared in The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu who was a famous female writer in the early years of the 11th century.
Akashi Government renovated its library and other facilities in November, 2017. Then, Akashi station's area was developed. A municipal library and other facilities reestablished in front of Akashi station. Therefore, accessibility in those facilities was exceedingly improved.
On July 21, 2001, 11 people were killed and 247 injured in a pedestrian stampede after a fireworks show. Five city and civil officials were subsequently convicted of negligence for not preventing the disaster.On April 1, 2018, Akashi became a core city.
