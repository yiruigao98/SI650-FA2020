== Club career ==


=== Athletic Bilbao ===
Born in Cantaura, Anzoátegui, Venezuela, Amorebieta joined Athletic Bilbao in 1996, aged 11. He met the club's eligibility standards having been raised in the Basque town of Iurreta and through his parents, both of whom hailed from the region. After progressing through the ranks – alongside Fernando Llorente– including CD Basconia (the farm team) and Bilbao Athletic (the reserves), he made his first-team debut in 2005–06, becoming an undisputed first-choice in the subsequent La Liga seasons.
Amorebieta played in a total of 47 official matches in 2009–10, helping Athletic reach the round-of-32 in the campaign's UEFA Europa League as well as an eighth-place finish in the league; he collected 18 yellow cards in the process, being sent off twice.Amorebieta began 2012–13 nursing a pubalgia ailment, and was later involved in a dispute over the extension of his contract.


=== Fulham ===
On 15 April 2013, Amorebieta agreed to sign a four-year deal with Fulham on a free transfer effective as of 1 July, after the expiration of his link with Athletic Bilbao. The Premier League club officially announced his signing on 22 May, and he made his debut on 14 September, coming on as a substitute for Kieran Richardson in a 1–1 draw against West Bromwich Albion at Craven Cottage.Amorebieta was sent off on 22 March 2014, for conceding a penalty with a foul on David Silva in an eventual 0–5 defeat at Manchester City. He scored his first goal in English football on 26 April, netting his team's second in an eventual 2–2 home draw with Hull City; he made 26 appearances overall in his debut season, which ended with relegation.On 6 March 2015, after returning from three months out injured, Amorebieta was sent off in Fulham's 1–5 home defeat by Bournemouth for bringing down Callum Wilson. On the 25th, he was loaned to fellow Championship side Middlesbrough until the end of the campaign, with left-back James Husband moving in the opposite direction. He scored his first goal for the club on 8 May, coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute for Lee Tomlin and netting a last-minute winner for a 2–1 away win over Brentford in the play-off semi-finals; he was unused in the final at Wembley Stadium, a 0–2 defeat to Norwich City.On 28 August 2015, Amorebieta returned to the Riverside Stadium for the entirety of the season, with Husband again being lent to Fulham for a month as part of the deal. On 1 February of the following year, however, he was recalled.


=== Sporting Gijón ===
On 22 July 2016, Amorebieta returned to Spain and its top division after agreeing to a three-year contract at Sporting de Gijón. He made his debut on 21 August, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 home win against former club Athletic.


=== Later years ===
On 10 July 2017, following Sporting's relegation, Amorebieta moved to Argentina and joined Club Atlético Independiente. In January 2019, the free agent agreed to a two-year deal at Cerro Porteño of the Paraguayan Primera División.


== International career ==


=== Spain ===
Amorebieta was part of the Spanish under-19 squad that won the UEFA European Championship in 2004. In August 2008, he was called up by new senior team manager Vicente del Bosque for a friendly against Denmark, but did not leave the bench.


=== Venezuela ===
As early as 2006, Amorebieta expressed his interest in playing for the Venezuela national team. However, according to FIFA rules at the time, he should have switched his affiliation prior to the age of 21, having previously played for Spain's youth sides. FIFA removed the rule in 2009, and talks between the player and the Venezuelan Football Federation resumed.
Finally, on 2 September 2011, Amorebieta made his senior debut in a friendly with Argentina, a 0–1 loss. On 11 October, against the same opponent but for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, he scored in a 1–0 home win, which signified Venezuela's first-ever win against the Albiceleste in the tournament.Amorebieta was included in Venezuela's squad for the 2015 Copa América, where he was sent off in the team's 0–1 loss to Peru in the group stage for a stamp on Paolo Guerrero. He retired from international football that November.


=== Basque Country ===
Amorebieta also appeared in four matches for the Basque Country national team (a non-FIFA affiliate), debuting against Venezuela in San Cristóbal, Táchira on 20 June 2007. The friendly match, a 4–3 Basque win, was the grand opening for the 43,000 all-seated Pueblo Nuevo Stadium, after two years of construction for the 2007 Copa América.
