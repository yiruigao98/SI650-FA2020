This is the list of cities and towns in Serbia, according to the criteria used by Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, which classifies the settlements into urban and rural, depending not only on size, but also on other administrative and legal criteria. Also villages with the municipal rights have been added to the list.


== Organization ==
CitiesCities in administrative sense are defined by the Law on Territorial Organization. The territory with the city status usually has more than 100,000 inhabitants, but is otherwise very similar to municipality. They enjoy a special status of autonomy and self-government, as they have their own civic parliaments and executive branches, as well as mayor (Serbian: gradonačelnik, plural: gradonačelnici) is elected through popular vote, elected by their citizens in local elections. Also, the presidents of the municipalities are often referred to as "mayors" in everyday usage. There are 29 cities (gradovi, singular: grad), each having an assembly and budget of its own.
As with a municipality, the territory of a city is composed of a city proper and surrounding villages (e.g. the territory of the City of Subotica is composed of the Subotica town and surrounding villages). The capital Belgrade is the only city on the level of a district. All other cities are on the municipality level and are part of a district.
City municipalitiesThe city may or may not be divided into city municipalities. Six cities (Belgrade, Novi Sad, Niš, Požarevac, Vranje and Užice) comprise several city municipalities. Competences of cities and city municipalities are divided. The city municipalities of these six cities also have their assemblies and other prerogatives. The two largest city municipalities by number of residents are Novi Sad (307,760 inhabitants) and New Belgrade (212,104 inhabitants).Of these six cities, only Novi Sad did not undergo the full transformation, as the newly formed municipality of Petrovaradin exists pretty much only formally; thus, the City municipality of Novi Sad is largely equated to city of Novi Sad. The city of Kragujevac had its own city municipalities from 2002 until 2008. In 2013, the city municipality of Sevojno within the city of Užice was established.
List of the citiesThe following cities have official administrative city rights:


== List of cities and municipalities ==
This is a list of cities and municipalities (excluding city municipalities) in Serbia, as defined by the Law on territorial organisation The data on population is taken from the 2011 census.It does not include municipalities in Kosovo created by the UNMIK after 1999. The census was not conducted in Kosovo, which is under administration of UNMIK, so the population numbers are not given for the municipalities in Kosovo.
According to the statistic criteria, the settlements in the table are classified as "urban" (i.e. cities and towns), as opposed to "rural" (villages). These criteria are not limited to the settlement size, but also include the percentage of residents engaged in agriculture, population density etc. Thus, not all towns in statistical sense are greater than villages, and they are not always municipality centers. Note that the population of the city municipalities of some cities were not presented as unique, but united in the city population.
