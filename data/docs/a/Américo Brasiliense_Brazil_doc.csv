Américo Brasiliense is a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo. The population is 38,202 (2015 est.) in an area of 123 km².This city is also known as Cidade Doçura ("sweetness city"), because its perimeter is surrounded by sugar cane plantations, which form the basis for its economy.  This is supported by cheap labor from emigrants from northeastern states, mainly from Bahia.
