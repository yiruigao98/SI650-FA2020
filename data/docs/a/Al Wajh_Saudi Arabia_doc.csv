Al Wajh is a comparatively big city, inhabited mainly by citizens from Al Balawi, Bedaiwi-Alali, Al Huety and Al Johani  tribes. Fishing is a primary activity of the city's residents and the port is the central location where this occurs - the Al Wajh port used to be one of the main shipping centres in the region 50 years ago.
The town is served by the Al Wajh Domestic Airport and has close links with the city of Tabuk, with a road connecting the two locations.
