Mukalla (Arabic: ٱلْمُكَلَّا‎, Al Mukallā) is a seaport and the capital city of Yemen's largest governorate, Hadhramaut. The city is located in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the Gulf of Aden, on the shores of the Arabian Sea, about 480 kilometres (300 miles) east of Aden. It is the most important port in the Hadhramaut, and the fifth-largest city in Yemen, with a population of approximately 300,000. The city is served by the nearby Riyan Airport.


== History ==
Mukalla is situated not far from "Cane" or "Qana", the ancient principal Hadrami trading post between India and Africa, with incense producing areas in its hinterland.Mukalla was founded in 1035 as a fishing settlement. This area was part of Oman until the middle of the 11th century, and later this area became part of Yemen. After witnessing a struggle for control by the Kathiri and Qu'aiti Sultanates in the 19th and 20th centuries, it became the capital of the Qu'aiti State of Hadhramaut, and then in 1967, it became a part of South Yemen. The Qu'aiti Sultanate was part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate until that merger, and a British Resident Advisor was stationed at Mukalla. The other major cities of the Sultanate were Ash-Shihr and Shibam.Captain Haines, a British officer who surveyed Yemen in the 1830s, described Mukalla as a town of 4500 inhabitants with a significant trade in slaves. In 1934, British traveler and explorer Freya Stark began her journey into the hinterland of the Hadhramaut from Mukalla, and her stay in that city is recorded in her book, The Southern Gates of Arabia.


=== Yemeni Civil War ===
During the Yemeni Civil War, on April 2, 2015, Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) stormed the central prison, freeing hundreds of prisoners including two senior AQAP commanders. They attacked the central bank and seized 17 billion Yemeni riyals and 1 million U.S. dollars before taking control of the presidential palace in the city. It was reported the entire city was under their control and they plan to establish an Islamic emirate in the wider Hadramaut region. Mukalla became AQAP's headquarters, and the capital of their Emirate in Yemen after their takeover.
In April 2015 Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi was killed in a US drone strike in the city, the SITE Intelligence Group said, citing media reports.On 3 November 2015, Cyclone Chapala struck the city and destroyed the city's waterfront.In 23 of March, a US airstrike hit an AQAP training camp, killing at least 50 people. Some days later, AQAP held a major rally in the city, against the US and their airstrikes. In April 2016, is reported that AQAP bounds at last 1,000 of its fighters inside the Mukalla only, with their taxes profit in the city to be from 2, to higher than 5 million U.S. dollars per day.In the middle of April 2016, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was consolidating its control in Mukalla and took over control of Mukalla's airport from forces affiliated with the pro-Ansar al Sharia Hadhrami Domestic Council, while also evacuating and planting explosives around nearby al Dhaba oil port. AQAP also arrested seven Yemeni fighters from a camp north of Mukalla in Wadi Hadramawt, where the UAE is reportedly training forces for operations against AQAP. AQAP is also redistributing property from northern landowners to local tribal leaders in an effort to shore up support, according to reports. The UAE, a core member of the Saudi-led coalition, recently led an operation to recapture AQAP-held al Hawta in Lahij governorate, amid reports the country is seeking U.S. assistance for an expanded counter-terrorism campaign in Yemen.
