== History ==
Aringay was an ancient village known in pre-colonial times as Alingay or Alinguey. When Spanish colonizers arrived in the late 16th century, they found an enclave of ethnic Pangasinenses actively trading with their Ilocano and Ifugao neighbors and traders from China, Japan and Southeast Asia. In a small village now known as Samara, a settlement headed by a descendant of Lakan Dula is thriving. The presence of Spanish soldiers, administrators and Augustinian missionaries ushered in the town’s colonial era and its conversion to Roman Catholicism.
Aringay remained a part of Pangasinan province until April 18, 1854, when the Spanish fused the northern towns of that province with the southern towns of Ilocos Sur to create the new province of La Union (hence, "The Union") The municipalities of Caba and Gallano (later placed in the province of Benguet and then abolished in 1900) were later carved out of Aringay’s northern borders.
The 18th and 19th century marked the active expansion of Ilocano territory. Scores of migrants from the Ilocos provinces pushed their way south so that by the end of the 19th century, Aringay was home to mostly Ilocano and Ilocanized Pangasinenses.
Outbreaks of rebellion rocked the town during four centuries of Spanish, American and Japanese colonization. Bloody confrontations ignited by revolutionaries such as Diego Silang and Gabriela Silang during Spanish occupation and by insurgents during the Philippine-American War and the Japanese occupation in World War II marred the bucolic villages of Aringay.
A decisive battle on Aringay River against U.S. forces crippled US forces . By 1901 the province of La Union was freed by American occupation.
Japanese forces attacked Aringay on December 1941 and occupied the town until their brutal withdrawal in 1945-1946, when many Aringayenos massacred the entire battalion of Japanese command in Aringay.
