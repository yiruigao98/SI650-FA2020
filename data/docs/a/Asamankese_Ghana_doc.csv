== History ==
The modern city of Asamankese was founded and occupied by the Akwamu. The Akwamus moved south and eastward from Dormaa around the 14th century to Twifo-Heman, North West Cape Coast. The move was commercially motivated and settled at the Twifo-Heman forest in the later part of the 16th century. Akwamus are Akans, they belonged to the Aduana family who are blood brothers of Asumennya, Dormaa and Kumawu. According to oral tradition, a succession dispute resulted in Otomfuo (brass-smith) Asare deserted the family to form a new state or city called Asaremankesee (Asare's big state).
Other settlers from  Juaben in Ashanti settled at Asamankese. During the reign of Nana Dokua [as both okyehene (king) and ohemaa (queenmother)] of Akyem, a section of the Juabens of Ashanti revolted against the Golden Stool of Ashanti. The rebels, led by their chief, Nana Kwaku Boateng, were forced to leave Juaben in Ashanti for the south. They found settlement at Kyebi, Kwabeng, Tafo, Asamankese and other parts of Akyem Abuakwa.
