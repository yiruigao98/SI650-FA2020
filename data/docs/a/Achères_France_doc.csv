Until then Achères was only served by Achères–Grand-Cormier station, on Paris–Le Havre railway, located 2 km (1.24 mi) from the city center. This situation was due to the destruction of Village d'Achères station (on Achères–Pontoise railway), which was closer, but destroyed by bombings during the night from 7–8 June 1944, and never set in service again.
