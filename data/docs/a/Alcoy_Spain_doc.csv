Alcoy (Spanish: [alˈkoj]) or Alcoi (Valencian: [alˈkɔj]) is an industrial and university city, region and municipality located in the province of Alicante, Spain. The Serpis river crosses the municipal boundary of Alcoi. The local authority reported a population of 61,135 residents in 2018.


== History ==
The first traces of human presence in the area date to c. 60,000 years ago, when Neanderthal hunters settled here, in a site now called El Salt. A site with rock paintings, dating to c. 10,000/6,500 years ago, has been discovered near la Sarga. From around the mid-3rd millennium BC people started to move from the caves to the plain where cereals were grown, while mountain fortifications were erected (Mola Alta de Serelles, Mas del Corral, Mas de Menente, El Puig).
After the Roman conquest of the Iberians, several rural villas were built in the area, as well as a necropolis. The town was established in 1256 by James I of Aragon, with the construction of a castle on a strategic position over the Serpis river, to secure the southern frontier of the Kingdom of Valencia during the Reconquista.
In 1291 the town was donated by King James II of Aragon to the Sicilian admiral Roger of Lauria; it will not return a royal possession until 1430.
During the War of Spanish Succession, Alcoi sided for the cause of archduke Charles, and was therefore besieged and stripped of numerous privileges, which started a period of decline.In 1873 the workers of Alcoy revolted in the Petroleum Revolution.

== Sport ==
The local football club CD Alcoyano is famous across Spain for a proverbial match in which they were facing a very adverse score. When the referee was about to close, the Alcoyano players kept asking for more time to score back and reach a draw.
Thus the phrase tener más moral que el Alcoyano ("to have greater morale than Alcoyano") ponders an undefatigable person. Currently, they play in the Segunda División B at El Collao Stadium.

The city is also home to PAS Alcoy, a Spanish roller hockey club, which plays in the OK Liga, the first division of roller hockey in Spain.
