The name "Aroor" traces its origins to the phrase "Arayarude Oor", which means the place of Hindu fishermen, mainly the sub class Vaalarayar or Vaala, derived the name from their unique fishing equipment "Dragon Tailed" (Vaal in Malayalam) Net used in their legal fishery. It was later shortened as "Arayaroor" and subsequently to the present version.

== Industries ==
Seafood export- Aroor is near Vembanad lake, a part of Kerala backwaters. This ecosystem helps large-scale prawn and shrimp farming to be an alternative to the low-lying paddy fields, which have the interlocked water system connected to the Kerala backwaters. Secondly the Cochin fishing harbour and port is just 15 km away from Aroor. The abundance of marine wealth and logistical advantages have helped the seafood export to grow, especially around Aroor. There are many marine food processing units in Aroor which provide employment to a number of people. The raw seafood catch is also purchased by large seafood export firms from North Kerala, Kollam, South Karnataka, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu, processed and preserved in cold storages, and then trans-shipped through Cochin port.
