Avocado Heights is an unincorporated census-designated place (CDP) in the San Gabriel Valley of Los Angeles County, California, United States. It is almost entirely surrounded by the City of Industry with only South El Monte sharing a border. It is in close proximity to both the Pomona (SR-60) and San Gabriel (I-605) freeways. To the west is the San Gabriel River and the California Country Club. Avocado Heights is approximately 15 miles (24 km) from the downtown Los Angeles Civic Center. The population was 15,411 at the 2010 census, up from 15,148 at the 2000 census.
A significant portion of Avocado Heights remains equestrian and semi-rural, with many homes on lots of 0.5 acres 21,780 square feet (2,023 m2) or more. The proximity of polluting industries in what became the City of Industry, as well as the Puente Hills Landfill, suppressed property values throughout the post-World War II era—discouraging the development that transformed most of the San Gabriel Valley into a relatively densely developed suburban area.
