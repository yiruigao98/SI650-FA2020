== History ==
Dahanu is an ancient town with a long history. It was settled probably as early as 500 CE. Some records show possible settlement as early as 150 BC. The reasons for nomadic lifestyle of locals are unknown. All these developments are before 100 CE and are in reference to Dahanu area rather than Dahanu village.
Later the village was settled. Soon it attracted many other communities like Tribals, Gujaratis and CKP community. Later the Zoroastrians arrived too. It was frequented by Arab travellers. By the 1490s, the Portuguese established their influence on the region. The region was under De Facto control of Portuguese from circa 1495 to 1540. Before this, it was under weak administration of Sultan of Gujarat. The Maratha Conquest of Thane and Vasai caused great damage to their influence as well as dominance over the region. The Inquisition established at Goa and other Portuguese Colonies fueled this change of power. During their reign, Portuguese built a small church to convert people to Christianity. This plan backfired and caused great discontent among people. The church fell in ruins and was destroyed before 1940.
Dahanu enjoyed good treatment from Marathas and relatively low taxes. In 1818, with fall of Maratha Empire, it went under British rule. An unnamed officer was assassinated in the town by villagers over some dispute in the 1870s. Its details are unknown. The town became a part of  Independent India after its Struggle for Independence. After the Sanyukta Maharashtra  Movement the Dahanu Taluka along with Talasari Taluka and Mumbai city became a part of Maharashtra state on 1 May 1960.
