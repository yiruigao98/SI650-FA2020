== History ==
The first people who settled this place before was a certain Datu Andarol, his wife Ba-e Mahanu, and their son Datu ‘Mangginayun’. Datu Andarol was a ruler and the leader of the Manobo tribe settling the village of Minduso, which was the old name of Don Carlos. The place was covered with forests and access by outlanders was prohibited unless permitted by the datu. Minduso was the home of Datu Andarol's descendants. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the datu was succeeded by his son, Datu Mangginayun. With their contacts with the Spaniards and missionaries, Spanish naming conventions and Christianity was introduced, and Datu Mangginayun adopted the name "Antonio", hence his full name was now Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sagandilan Sr.  He was married to Ba-e Antonina Manlayuan. His leadership reflects that of his father, as he implemented tribal laws and settled criminal offenses, particularly murder. As the leader of his tribal community, he also presided wedding ceremonies and settled dowries.
The first popular Spanish stranger who approached Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sr. was Tomás Sandoval. He requested a parcel of land that he intend to borrow and to till, the datu conceded to his request. As part of the agreement, Tomás was to give the part of his harvest as a share to the datu. Several years later, another Spaniard by the name of "Elizalde" came and, like Tomás, requested the datu for lands to establish ranches. The lands lent by the datu to Elizalde were: lands in Pantil-pantilan, Migtutugop, the lands along the Mulita river, the today-famous Squash Mountain, and the Tugas Falls. As the agricultural ventures of these two Spaniards flourished, Cebuanos (referred by the Lumads, or natives, as "Dumagats") and other Spaniards who came from Cagayan de Misamis and other coastal towns of Misamis were encouraged to settle and populate the area that comprises the present-day Don Carlos.
Census registry for the settlers of Minduso was only located at Ramag (Manobo for ‘breakfast’), which has a fully established local government facilities and would later be known as Maramag. Antonio Sr.'s son, Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sagandilan Jr. was born on March 17, 1917 at Miuvan (now Barangay Sinangguyan) and had his birth registered at Maramag. Antonio Jr. was drafted into the USAFFE before World War II and completed his training with the rank of corporal. However, he was called upon to fight on the outbreak of war, and his family did nothing about it.
When the war ended, Antonio Jr. succeeded his father in the leadership of his tribe as a datu in 1946. He was first a tribal councilor, and later became a barangay captain of the whole of Minduso. During his time of service, Señora Remedios ‘Meding’ Fortich de Ozamis personally visited Antonio Jr. and she petitioned the name change of Miuvan (which is now Barangay Sinangguyan) to ‘Don Carlos’ in his husband's memory, Don Carlos Azcona Fortich, and as a gratitude for living in the land which the Sagandilans flourished. At first, the datu declined, as the flourishing enclave has significance for their patrimony. Eventually, under Republic Act No. 4800, Minduso and other neighboring villages and barangays were clustered to form the municipality of Don Carlos in 1966.
