Dongxing (东兴; 東興; Dōngxìng) is a county-level city within Fangchenggang, Guangxi, People's Republic of China, on the border with Móng Cái, in Vietnam. The city spans an area of 549 square kilometers, and has a population of approximately 130,000 as of 2011.


== History ==
During the Qing Dynasty, the area was administered as Fangcheng County (防城县; 防城縣). Dongxing was briefly established as a city in 1950, but was merged back into Fangcheng County by 1952. On December 25, 1978, Fangcheng County was re-designated as Fangcheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County (防城各族自治县).On May 23, 1993, Fangcheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County was abolished, as the prefecture-level city of Fangchenggang was created. With this, the county-level division of Dongxing Economic Development Zone (东兴经济开发区) was established.On April 29, 1996, the Dongxing Economic Development Zone was abolished, and the county-level city of Dongxing was established. Dongxing was granted authority over the towns of Dongxing, Jiangping, and Malu.


=== Refugees from Vietnam ===
In the summer of 1978, the Friendship Bridge that connected Dongxing and Mong Cai in Vietnam became a makeshift refugee camp for thousands of ethnic Chinese fleeing Vietnam. Ethnic Chinese had lived in Northern Vietnam for decades under Communist rule, but after the North and South unified in April 1975, the Communist government saw the Chinese in the South, many of whom were successful capitalists and receiving political support financed by Beijing following the Vietnam War, as a threat to their socialist system and began persecuting the Chinese, forcing many to flee by boat. They became part of the known Boat People. This caused an exodus of over 250,000 Chinese from Vietnam to China, mainly to Dongxing.


== Geography ==
Dongxing is located in the very south of Guangxi, on the northwest shores of the Gulf of Tonkin. The Beilun River marks the southwest border of Dongxing, with Vietnam on the other side of the river. The terrain is largely hilly.
