On the highest level, Papua New Guinea is divided into 4 regions, which are Highlands, Islands, Momase, and Southern regions.
Below, Papua New Guinea has 22 province-level divisions: 20 integrated provinces, the autonomous province of North Solomons (Bougainville) and the National Capital District.
Each province has one or more districts, and each district has one or more local-level government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.Wards typically consist of a few hundred to a few thousand individuals, and are the lowest level of government administration under local-level governments (LLGs). Wards are further divided into census units (CU).
