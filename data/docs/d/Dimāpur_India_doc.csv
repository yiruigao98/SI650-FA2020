Dimapur is a city in Nagaland, India. It is the most populous city in Nagaland and also the most densely populated city in the state with an estimated population of about 250,000. The city is the main gateway and commercial centre of Nagaland. 
Located near the border with Assam along the banks of the Dhansiri River, Dimapur is the only plains tract of hilly Nagaland and also has the only railway station and airport in the state for connectivity and economic activity.


== Etymology ==
The name Dimapur is derived from the Kachari language; Di means "water", ma means "large" and pur (sanskritised word) means "city", translating to "Big-river-city", associated with the meaning of "Kachari" which is "people of the river valley" and after the river which flows through it (Dhansiri).
There are two accounts of the way in which Dimapur got its name : many writers are of the opinion that the name 'Dimapur' was derived from Dimasa Kachari words Di-meaning water, Ma-meaning big and Pur-meaning city or township in the Dimasa dialect; while others contend that Dimapur is a corruption of Hidimbapur, meaning the city of Hidimbi (of Mahabharata fame) - the rakshasi-turned-woman whose marriage to the Pandava prince Bhima led to the birth of Ghatotkacha, believed to be the progenitor of the Kacharis. According to the second theory, the name  Hidimbapur is conjectured to have been abbreviated to Dimbapur and subsequently to have lost a consonant to become Dimapur. In the Ahom Chronicles, Dimapur Is referred to sometimes as ‘Che-din-chi-pen’ (town-earth-burn-make) meaning ‘brick town’.


== History ==
Situated on the banks of the Dhansiri (originally known as Dong-siri meaning a ravine of peaceful habitation),  Dimapur, often described as the ‘Brick City’ by European scholars and also by the Ahoms, was the ancient capital of Dimasa Kachari community and an independent nation of the Dimasa, who were once a powerful and predominant in the now North East India region (Brahmaputra/Dilao Valley).


=== Medieval period ===
According to popular belief, the city's formation in Nagaland is separate from that of Assam. In the Middle Ages, it was the capital of the Dimasa Kingdom. In the heart of the town there is an old relic of the Dimasa Kachari Kingdom which speaks about the once prosperous era.


=== 1900 ===
During World War II, Dimapur was the centre of action between British India and Imperial Japan. It was the staging post for the Allied offensive. The Japanese could reach Kohima where a siege was laid. Allied reinforcement came through Dimapur by rail and road for the push against the Japanese. An airport at Dimapur was also in use for supplies to the allied forces in Burma. The battle for Kohima about 77 km from Dimapur is considered the turning point for the Japanese retreat from South East Asia.
The Jains were amongst the earliest non-Naga settlers of Nagaland. A few Jain families came to Kohima in the 1880s and settled there. They later moved to Dimapur in 1944 due to Japanese invasion during World War II. Prominent among them were  Phulchand Sethi, Udayram Chabra, Mangilal Chabra, Phulchand Binaykia, Jethmal Sethi,  Ramchandra Sethi, Bhajanlal Sethi, Kanhaiyal Sethi, Nathmal Sethi etc. Phulchand Sethi, Bhajanlal Sethi and other Sethi and Chabra brethren set up the SD Jain Temple, SD Jain School, SD Jain Charitable Hospital. Kanhaiyalal Sethi, Phulchand Sethi, and his brothers also built the Durga Mandir in Old Daily Market.
