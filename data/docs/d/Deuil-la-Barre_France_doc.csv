Deuil-la-Barre is a commune in the northern suburbs of Paris, France. It is in the Department of Val d'Oise, the préfecture of Cergy-Pontoise and the sous-préfecture of Sarcelles. It is 13.7 km (8.5 mi) from the centre of Paris. Despite this proximity to the metropolis, Deuil has retained much of the charm of a country village, with orchards and wooded hillsides.


== Name ==
In modern French, the word deuil means mourning. That is  not, however, the derivation of this commune's name. The word is in fact Celtic, a combination of divo (God) and ialo (a clearing in a wood.) Historical citations include the toponyms Diogilum (862,) Doguillum, Diogilo (9th century,) and Villam Dueil (1070.)
Originally called simply Deuil in modern times, the name of the commune became officially Deuil-la-Barre on 7 December 1952. Barre here has the sense of a barrier or enclosure.
The demonym is Deuillois.


== History ==
On 7 August 1850, a part of the territory of Deuil-la-Barre (then called simply Deuil) was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Saint-Gratien, a part of the territory of Soisy-sous-Montmorency, and a part of the territory of Épinay-sur-Seine to create the commune of Enghien-les-Bains.


== Transport ==
Deuil-la-Barre is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris – Nord suburban rail network: Gare de Deuil-Montmagny and Gare de La Barre-Ormesson. Trains run from the Gare du Nord to Deuil-Montmagny on the quarter hour, the journey taking 14 minutes.
