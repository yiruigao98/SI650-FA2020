Darreh Shahr (Persian: دره‌شهر‎) is a city, and seat of Darreh Shahr County, located in the south-eastern part of Ilam Province, in the northern foothills of Kabir Kuh ranges. According to the 2016 census there are 21,900 residents, making it the second-largest city in the province.It is believed that Darreh Shahr was once Madaktu, an important city in the Anshan Province of Elamite Kingdom with a population of about 74,000. The Elmite Kingdom had three important cities: Susa, Hidali and Madaktu. Madaktu served as an advance post toward Mesopotamia. The city was destroyed in 693 BC by Ashurbanipal during the Assyrian conquest of Elam.
Madaktu saw many ups and down during centuries. After the Assyrian conquest, the city went into ruins and lost its significance. It did not regain its prosperity in the Achaemenid Empire. The Parthians era was a period of relative revival but it was during the Sasanian Empire that the city, then a settlement of about 5000 household and renamed to Seymareh, saw its utmost restoration and success. Nowadays, the ruins of Madaktu is abound with artifacts from that era, most of which are in display in Darreh Shahr Museum.
The modern-day Darreh Shahr was part of Lorestan Province. In 1964, some areas of Lorestan and Khuzestan provinces were annexed to create Ilam Governorate-General and was declared a province ten years later in 1974. For the same reason, most of the people of Darreh Shahr speak Laki and Luri as opposed to Kurdish, the main spoken language of the province.
Darreh Shahr has very hot and dry summers and mild and wet winters with long-term average of 455.2 mm (17.92 in) precipitation, almost all of which come in form of rain during winter.


== History ==
In ancient times, Elamites governed the Lorestan mountains and constructed several strong buildings. Darreh Shahr was the first Elamite city attacked and destroyed by Assyrians in addition to the massacre of people. In Seymareh Valley the remains of the Sassanid monuments are still present; hence Darreh Shahr might have been a thriving city in the Sassanid and the Parthian periods. Furthermore, some foreign experts call the unearthed city as the second and lost capital of the Seleucids while some Iranian archaeologists believe that the monuments are part of the state of Sirvan. Referencing some resources and texts, Darreh Shahr may be the same as Mihrajanqadhaq, Saabzaan, Seymareh or the city of Khosrau II in the late Sassanid period completely leveled to earth from an earthquake in the years 248 and 344 A.H.Despite the fact that there is no strong and reliable evidence to show the first time human being settled in this are, most historians believe that Madakto Ancient City as a city in Sassanid era and because of its proximity to Ctesiphon was in fact a summer capital for kings in that era. Historians also believe the city was founded by Khosrau II. The great and impregnable fortress in east of Ctesiphon mountains that Khosrau II built to protect his family when threatened is believed to be in Darreh Shahr as well.Hormozan, a ruling king of Sassanid era was from Mehrgan Kade.
