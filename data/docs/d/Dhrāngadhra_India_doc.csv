Dhrangadhra (pronunciation ) is a town and a municipality in Surendranagar district in the state of Gujarat, India. During the period of the British Raj, the city was the capital of Dhrangadhra State, one of the eight first-class princely states (13-gun salute) of the Kathiawar Agency in the Bombay Presidency.


== Etymology ==
In Sanskrit dhrang means a stone, and dhara means the earth. It is believed that because of the strong and widespread yellow stone bedrock found immediately under the soil of the place, the town is thus named.


== History ==

Dhrangadhra has a long history starting from Lower Paleolithic Period. The River named Falku is passing from Dhrangadhra town. The evidence come from the river bed of the Bhadar river which flows along with the Dhragadhra taluka. Moreover, there are many Harappan-period sites. Recent studies in the area suggests that the Dhragadhra and Halvad taluka was the frontier of the so-called sorat Harappans which bifurcates the Sidhi Harrapans of Kutch &andSindh. These are recent studies made by Arun Malik, a PhD scholar of The M.S. University of Baroda and now he is with Archaeological Survey of India.
