== History ==
Taken from Bagé, the population arose because of contraband. A Spaniard, Pedro Ansuateguy, known as Dom Pedrito, organized this illegal activity, opening the path that gave way to roads, hence the origin of the name of the municipality.
The population of the region began in 1800, and was emancipated in 1872. Initially, it was called Our Lady of Sponsorship of Dom Pedrito; subsequently, it came to be called only Dom Pedrito. In 1888, the center was elevated to the status of city.
This region was badly hit by three armed conflicts, the Farroupiha revolution, the Federalist revolution of 1893, and by the Revolution of 1923. The peace treaty of the Farroupilha revolution was signed in Ponche Verde (Dom Pedrito), which caused the capital to be known as the "Capital of Peace".
After the Revolution of 1923, there was a huge growth in progress throughout the area, principally in the sectors of livestock and wheat. Dom Pedrito has always kept its geographic distribution since its emancipation, not giving land to any other municipality.
At the end of the twentieth century there was a huge growth in rice cultivation in the municipality. At the beginning of the 21st century, vineyards were planted for the industrial production of wine. The municipality also grows other fruits, like melon.


== Religion ==
The majority of the population in the city declares itself Catholic, however in the last few years there has been a considerable amount of growth in the number of Protestants in the municipality. A few notable ones are the Foursquare, Assembly of God, Baptist, Church of God and Love, among others.
