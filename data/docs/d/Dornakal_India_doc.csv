== History ==
Like the names of many villages of India, the name Dornakal has some geographic significance. The word Dornakal means "a group of stones" and this meaning is applicable to the immediate locality. The word "stone," or its equivalent, is used in more than a dozen forms in the naming of the villages of the Deccan plateau. Dornakal is located on the slopes of a rock region thru which a small river flows. The stream has its source about 40 milesnorth of the village. It is the overflow of a big "natural tank" or lake, which has an area of twenty four square miles.
Dornakal proper was founded some hundreds of years ago, but the new Dornakal and its extension came into prominence in the late 1800s (around 1890) with the advent of the railway and the mission. Dornakal was located in a forested region where tigers were quite common. The main factors in the expansion of the town is due to its position on thc main railway route to important towns; the timber of the forests; the resources of coal fields near the village; and the activities of a Christian mission, with its school for vocational training.
