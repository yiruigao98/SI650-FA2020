Baba Khadeswari was a Sadhu from Uttar Pradesh, who had visited this place in the early seventies and had decided to build a temple on the hill top. He never spoke and communicated only through sign language. He stood throughout his life and used to wear wooden paduka.
Today the temple has become a small tourist attraction. Pucca road from the bottom of the hill till the hill top has already been constructed.
