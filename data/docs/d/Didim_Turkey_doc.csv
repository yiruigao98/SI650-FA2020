== Plot ==
Maritess (Kylie Padilla), a nursing student gets plagued by inexplicable nightmares when she moves into a dormitory. On a trip to Quiapo, a seer tells her that she is a conduit between the living and the dead, and that ghosts are drawn to her because she's one of the few who can help them cross to the other side. Back at the dorm, Maritess meets Mia (Ella Cruz), her fellow boarder, and things get even stranger. Her nightmares get worse and she confides in a new found friend, Emerson (Rayver Cruz). Maritess eventually discovers that Mia is a ghost of a nursing student who, along with her friend Aya (Nathalie Hart) disappeared about five years ago and the history unfolds.    
The flirty Aya had a habit of going out on blind dates with men she met online, and usually drags Mia along on these dates. Aya has epilepsy and takes maintenance meds. They meet up with Quinito Casta√±eda (Rafael Rosell) and his friend, Danny (Joross Gamboa) who take them to a beach resort in Cavite. They start drinking. Mia becomes overly protective which prompts Danny to invite her to chill outside, leaving Aya alone with Quinito. Things start to heat up between the two and Quinito gives Aya a pill which promptly induces an epilepsy attack. Quinto panics and end up putting a pillow over Aya's head eventually killing her. Mia walks in just in time and goes into hysterics, and in Danny ends up killing her. The two girls are placed in a drum and is brought to the beach.

Back in the dorm, police are alerted about the girls disappearance, but with no leads the investigation goes cold.
