== History ==
The area was a part of the Cebuano Kingdom of Nahalin, ruled by Sri Ukob, one of the sons of Sri Lumay, the ruler and founder of the Rajahnate of Cebu, before the conquest of Cebu by the Spanish starting in 1565. In 1570, it became an ecomienda of unknown Spanish officials, until the 18th century.  Danao was made a parish by the Recollects in 1609, and in 1773, it officially became a municipality.  In 1961, a national charter was passed to convert it into a city.

=== Railways ===
The Cebu railway ran from Danao south to Argao. During World War II, the bridges, tracks and Central Station were bombed so extensively that the railway never recovered, and it closed in 1942. After that, whatever was left after the war was dug up to become the Cebu North Road.
Now a new light railway is to be built in Cebu.


=== Sugar ===

The old system of milling sugar cane used to produce sugar, called "intosan". Although the railway was originally to move coal, it was soon used too to move sugar cane to the docks.


=== Gun industry ===
Danao City was well known for its gun industry. The industry started around 1905–06. When World War II came, the Danao gunsmiths went underground, joined the guerrilla movement or were inducted into the United States Army Forces in the Far East. Their main task was to re-chamber the Japanese Arisaka rifles to fit the US .30 caliber round or to keep the original Japanese rifle in good service.
The industry went on, still underground. In the 1960s, the term paltik was given to the homemade (and illegal) guns. In the early 1990s the industry was legalized by the government, with the creation of two organizations of local gunsmiths. The organization now left with proper permit is Workers League of Danao Multi-purpose Cooperative (World MPC), in Dungguan, Danao City.World MPC was incorporated on October 1994 with twenty-five initial members. In November 1996 it was given license to manufacture handguns from caliber .22 to .45 by the Philippine National Police (PNP). The organization had been a potent group in working for the legalization of gun-making industry in the country with the aim to upgrade the technology and skills of gun makers, to provide job security and additional revenue for the government. The gun-making industry in Danao was pioneered using brass or copper as materials. The Chairman of World MPC was in charge of the compliance of the requirements of the Firearms Explosives Security Service Agency and Guards Supervisory Section (FESSAGES) until his death in 2010 after which World MPC itself was then shutdown for non-compliance of FESSAGES policies.
