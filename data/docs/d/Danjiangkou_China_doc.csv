The area of present-day Danjiangkou belonged to both the Han and the Chu during the Warring States period. After the Warring States period, the area was conquered by the Qin dynasty, which administered the area as Wudang County (武当县; 武當縣), after the nearby Wudang Mountains. Wudang County belonged to the Nanyang Commandery. In 208 CE, the area formed part of the newly established Nanxiang Commandery. In 289 CE, under the Jin Dynasty, the area formed part of the newly established Shunyang Commandery. During the Yongjia rebellion, many refugees from present-day Linfen, Shanxi settled in Wudang County. In 618 CE, Wudang County became part of the newly formed Wudang Commandery (武当郡; 武當郡). In 1119, Wudang Commandery became the Wudang Jun (武当军; 武當軍). In 1276, the Wudang Jun became the Jun Prefecture. In 1476, the area was merged into Xiangyang Fu.The area remained part of the Jun Prefecture until the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912, which re-organized the Jun Prefecture as Jun County (均县; 均縣). In May 1914, Jun County was assigned to Hubei Circuit. In 1932, it was moved to the province's 11th Administrative Circuit, and was moved to the province's 8th Administrative Circuit in 1936.On March 21, 1948, the county seat was taken by the People's Liberation Army, and the rest of the county was taken by March 28. On June 2, the Jun County Democratic County Government was established by the Communist Party. With the foundation of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the county's government was renamed to the Jun County People's Government.Jun County was briefly revoked in July 1960, and was merged into Guanghua County, before being re-established in 1962.
