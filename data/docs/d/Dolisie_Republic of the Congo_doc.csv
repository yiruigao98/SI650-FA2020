Dolisie, known as Loubomo between 1975 and 1991, is a city in the western province of Niari in the Republic of the Congo. It is the country's third largest city, and an important commercial centre.  The city lies on the eastern edge of the coastal rainforest, and has a population of 83,798 (2007 census).


== History ==
The city was founded as a station on the Congo-Ocean Railway, and it was named after Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's lieutenant Albert Dolisie.
It became a thriving city thanks to the wealth of the railway, and it had 20,000 inhabitants in 1972. The city's name changed to Loubomo in 1975, and soon it became the third largest city in Congo-Brazzaville. The civil war of the late 1990s caused an exodus of rural people towards cities, and Loubomo's population has significantly increased since then.
