Downers Grove is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. It was founded in 1832 by Pierce Downer, whose surname serves as the eponym for the village. It is a southwestern suburb of Chicago in the I-55 Corridor.


== History ==
Downers Grove was founded in 1832 by Pierce Downer, a farmer who traveled to Illinois from Rutland, New York, but was originally from Vermont. Its other early settlers included the Blodgett, Curtiss, Blanchard, Stanley, Lyman, and Carpenter families. The original settlers were mostly migrants from the Northeastern United States and Northern Europe. The first schoolhouse was built in 1844.
The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was extended from Aurora to Chicago through Downers Grove in 1864, boosting its population. The town was incorporated in March 1873. Its somewhat unusual spelling ("Apostrophe-free since 1873") remains a minor historical mystery.

In April 1947, the wreck of a Burlington Railroad Twin Cities Zephyr passenger train killed three people, including the engineer. The streamliner struck a large tractor which had fallen from a freight train and two passenger cars crashed through a wall of the Main Street Station.
The construction of two major toll roads along the village's northern and western boundaries, I-355 in 1989, and what is now referred to as I-88 in 1958, facilitated the village's access to the rest of Chicago metropolitan area. Downers Grove has developed into a bustling Chicago suburb with many diverse businesses, including the headquarters for Devry University, FTD, Ambitech Engineering Corp, Dover, Heartland Food Corporation, and HAVI Global Solutions.


== Economy ==
Downers Grove's roughly 50-minute (25-minute express) connection to the Loop via three BNSF Railway stations provides many working residents with a convenient commute to the city. Nevertheless, Downers Grove itself serves as headquarters for a multitude of locally, regionally, and nationally renowned businesses.
Respective examples include Every Day's a Sundae, The Savory Gourmet, Advocate Health Care, and Fortune 500 member Dover Corporation. The village is also home to regional satellite offices of numerous national corporations, including Microsoft, MetLife, and State Farm.Downers Grove's retail economy is largely supported by the local section of Ogden Avenue. Formerly part of U.S. Route 66, the stretch of Ogden Avenue that weaves through Chicago's western suburbs is particularly known for its extensive range of automobile dealerships, classic car dealerships, and service centers.
Brands represented by Downers Grove auto groups include Aston Martin, Bentley, Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram, Ford, Lamborghini, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Volkswagen. Ogden—a colloquial shortening of the road's name—is also framed by a variety of grocery and convenience stores such as CVS, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, Jewel, Trader Joe's, and Walgreens. While the road serves primarily as a route to destinations, industrial and corporate parks that host the aforementioned headquarters can be found on Ogden's tributaries adjacent to major tollways such as I-355 or I-88.
