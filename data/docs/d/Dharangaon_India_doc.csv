== History ==
Dharangaon was formerly known as Mina Nagar.citation needed At the time of the Moghal conquest in the 10th century, Dharangaon was famous for its jirifaf and bhiran clothing. During the seventeenth century, under the reign of Dongong, Dorongon, and Drongom, it was mentioned by multiple sources as a trade center of considerable importance. In 1674, English settlers established a factory in the town. The following March, the town was plundered by King Chhatrapati Shivaji. Four years later in 1679, King Shivaji joined forces with the Raja of Berar and again plundered Dharangaon, which at that time was one of the most flourishing places in the country. In 1683 the Drongom investment was 10,000 pieces broad bastas, 10,000 pieces sevgazis, and 100,000 lbs. (2500 mans) of turmeric. In 1685 King Sambhaji plundered the town, burning or pillaging every house. The factors at Dharangaon had but two hours to escape. Under the Marathas, Dharangaon suffered much from Bhil raids and was the scene of one of the Bhil massacres by which the Marathas vainly attempted to keep order. 
It came into British possession in 1800, and from 1825 to 1830, Lieutenant, afterward Sir James, Outram busied himself in raising the Bhil Corps. In 1844 two American planters, Mr. Blount of Gorakhpur and Mr. Simpson of Madras, who had been appointed superintendents of cotton experiments, set up saw-gins. In 1845 a screw press was built, but because of its costliness proved to be a failure. 
In 1850 gins, nineteen in number, were hired to Ritchie Stewart Add and Co. of Bombay, who had established an agency, and a further supply of twenty-one was made for them. In 1854 the office of superintendent was abolished, and only a small establishment was kept to take charge of the gins. Out of these nineteen had been sold, a few hired out, and fifty-nine remained ready for 'disposal without any applicants. In 1855 Government established a factory with ninety-three saw gins under the management of a European overseer; merchants and cultivators were charged £1 (Rs. 10) a month for the hire of a gin. But the experim ent proved costly, and after a time was given up. In 1865 120 gins were available, and an establishment kept at a yearly cost of £144 (Rs. 1440), an outlay not nearly covered by the income realized from the gins. Dharangaon, a municipal town in Jalgaon District, 57 km North-east of Dhulia, contained, in 1872, 11,807 inhabitants, and in 1879 had a municipal income of £438 (Rs. 4380). In the 18th century, various Rajput communities came to Dharangaon, primarily from Bayas and Chauhan. Dynasty also referred as "Purbhe"(initially "Purve" referring to the direction "East" In Marathi - "Purva"). These communities came from "Chandavad Fort" as they were in service of that fort.
