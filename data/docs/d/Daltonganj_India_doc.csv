== History ==
Palamu traces its history from neolithic and chalcolithic era and axe, utensils and furnaces of the Harappan period are found at the confluence of Son and North Koel river in Kabra-Kala mound. Asur people have been one of the oldest inhabitants and developed civilization around the region. Other tribes, e.g- Baiga, Ho, Chero, Kol, Kharwar and many others lived here and ruled since centuries.
Later, Palamu was ruled by Nagvanshis of Chotanagpur since 5th century. Many of its kings ruled the region until Mughals invaded Palamu region. Later, Khayaravala dynasty also ruled the region from 11th-12th century from Rohtasgarh (now Sasaram, Bihar) and then Rakshel Dynasty captured the region and ruled from Surguja State (Chattisgarh). Then, Chero dynasty ruled this region for a long period around the 14-15th century, AD.
In 1589, Man Singh I, the Mughal governor assumed the charge of Bihar Province and marched against Cheros. He subjugated Cheros and took them as prisoners and overthrown them into forests. But after the death of Emperor Akbar, the Cheros regained the power and started ruling the region. Palamu region was then ruled by most powerful Chero ruler, Medini Ray. He also built Palamu Fort, Shahpur Fort and Bishrampur Fort. In 1719, during the reign of Muhammad Shah, Sarbuland Khan was appointed as the Subedar of Bihar Province who again overthrown Chero ruler, Raja Yadunath Shah and made him he flee from Palamu the established his new capital at Palkot. Later in 1740, Hidayat Ali Khan was nominated as Jagirdar of Japla (at Palamu) and Cheros assisted him in an invasion against Ramgarh Raj.
In 1771, East India Company asked Cheros to surrender and marched towards Palamu after neglect from kings, Raja Chitrajit Rai and Jainath Singh. Later, Captain Camac marched to Palamu, fought war and Palamu fort was surrendered.
Palamu witnessed the Kol rebellion in 1832 and Cheros and the Kharwars also rose against the administration, and non-tribal Hindus and Muslims. It was a reaction to unfair treatment brought on by the systems of land tenure and administration that had been introduced by British powers in the area.
In, Indian Rebellion of 1857, two Kharwar tribals of Bhogta clan, Nilamber and Pitamber fought against British and organised Palamu against them and also had a great impact of activism of Birsa Munda in 1895 against British and Christian missionaries.
In 1920, 'The Bihar Students’ Conference' was held at Daltonganj under Rev. C.F. Andrews. In 1927, many national leaders participated and visited in it including Mazharul Haque, Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Palamu region took active part in Independence movement of India and the Adibasi Mahasabha and Chotanagpur Unnati Samaj also played a key role in demand of separate land for Adivasis, called Jharkhand.
