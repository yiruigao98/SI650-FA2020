== History ==
Historical Konuralp is 8 km north of Düzce; first settlements there go back to 3rd century BC. Until 74 BC it was one of the most important cities belonging to the Bithynia State, which included Bilecik, Bolu, Sakarya, Kocaeli. It was conquered by Pontus and then by the Roman Empire. During the Roman period the city was influenced by Latin culture, and it changed its name to Prusias ad Hypium. Later on Christianity affected the city and after the separation of the Roman Empire in 395, it was controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire (the later Byzantine Empire).
Konuralp Bey, one of Osman Gazi's commanders, was ordered to conquer Düzce and its surroundings to the Ottoman lands. In the 14th century he captured Duzbazaar (Düzce) and Roman Prusias after a battle against the Byzantines. The first Ottoman administrators in Düzce were Konuralp Bey, Sungur Bey, Semsi Bey and Gunduz Alp. During the late 16th century villagers choose this location as a marketplace; it was called Düzce Bazaar in the centre of the plain.
During the Ottoman Empire, Düzce provided Navy timber, and it became an important centre of transportation between Istanbul and the eastern cities such as Sivas and Erzurum. At the 18th and 19th centuries the tradesmen took the control of Düzce and commerce flourished.
