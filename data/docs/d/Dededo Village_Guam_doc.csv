Dededo (Chamorro: Dedidu; formerly in Spanish: Dededo Spanish: [dededo], in Japanese: デデド, Dededo) is the most populated village in the United States territory of Guam. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Dededo's population was just under 45,000 in 2010. The village is located on the coral plateau of Northern Guam. The greater Dededo-Machanao-Apotgan Urban Cluster had a population of 139,825 as of the 2010 census, and comprises 87.7% of Guam's population.


== Etymology ==
The origin of the village name Dededo, Dedidu in Chamorro, may come from the practice of measuring using fingers. The Spanish word for finger is dedo. It can be theorized that someone measured out the original village this way. Another possibility is that the word “dededo” is a version of the word “dedeggo,” which means “heel of the foot,” or that it comes from the word “deggo” which means to “walk on tiptoes.”


== History ==

Before World War II, Dededo Village was at the bottom of Macheche Hill. Dededo grew into a major village after the war when the U.S. Navy constructed housing for displaced Guamanians and for laborers coming from off-island to help in Guam's development.Following Typhoon Karen in 1962, Kaiser Subdivision in Dededo was constructed for islanders displaced by the storm. Further housing subdivisions were constructed increasing the village's population.
In 1984, the Northern Community Health Center opened. In addition to traditional health services provided by the village clinics, this center offered communicable disease control services and dental health as well as chronic disease care and crippled children services.In October 1988, the island’s first large-scale and fully enclosed shopping mall, the Micronesia Mall, opened.
