Dijkot was once named the “State of Dijkot.” The name "Dijkot" is derived from the word ‘ditch,’ which roughly translates to 'fort,' or 'city inside a fort'.
Dijkot is named after a warrior tribe. The city was destroyed in 326 BC, when it was attacked by the army of Alexander the Great and as a result, the population declined significantly. 
The city was eventually re-inhabited and ruled by Chandragupta Maurya, who brought the town to significance. In 712 AD, Muhammad bin Qasim attacked Sindh, in southeast Pakistan. Qasim reached Chiniot, a city in Punjab, where he was subsequently arrested. 
The city was attacked in 1460 by local tribes and once again destroyed. It was rebuilt for second time by saint Baba Sher Shah, who lived south of the state. In 1908, a police station was established in the area, along with a government high school.
