== History ==
In the Middle Ages, the village belonged to the Radziwiłłs, a Polish–Lithuanian aristocratic family.  Jews lived in Koidanova as early as 1620.


=== Jewish community ===
Jews lived in Koidanova as early as 1620. Koidanova became the site of a new Hasidic Jewish dynasty in 1833 when Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Perlow (1797–1862) became the first Koidanover Rebbe. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Boruch Mordechai Perlow (1818–1870), grandson, Rabbi Aharon Perlow (1839–1897), and great-grandson, Rabbi Yosef Perlow of Koidanov-Minsk (1854-1915), who was the last Koidanover Rebbe to live in the town. After World War I, the dynasty was moved to Baranovichi, Poland.In 1847, Koidanova had 2,497 Jewish inhabitants.  In 1897 the city had a total population of 4,744, of whom 3,156 were Jews.


=== Inter-war period ===

In May 1932 it was granted the status of a city and was renamed Koidanau (Belarusian: Ко́йданаў, romanized: Kojdanaŭ) or Koydanov (Russian: Ко́йданов, romanized: Koydanov).  In June of that year it was renamed again as Dziaržynsk by the Communist authorities, in honour of Felix Dzerzhinsky (1877–1926), a famous Bolshevik creator and chief of the "Cherezzychainaya Komissija" (CHEKA) – the Soviet secret police - who was born in a Dziaržynava estate not far from the city, although on the other side of the then Polish-Soviet border.The city was the capital of the short-lived Dzierzynszczyzna Polish Autonomous District during 1932–38.


=== World War II ===
It fell under German occupation during World War II. It was captured on June 28, 1941.
The Lithuanian Twelfth Schutzmannschaft (auxiliary police) Battalion's 1st Company, led by Lieutenant Z. Kemzura, massacred approximately 1,600 Jews from the city on October 21, 1941, shooting them and throwing them into a pit; many were buried alive.  As it is reported in The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry: "For three hours the earth covering the mass grave would move; people still alive were trying to crawl out of their grave."  On March 1–2,1942, the Einsatzgruppen transported several thousand Jews from throughout Belarussia and murdered them in Koidanov. The city was liberated by the Soviet Red Army on July 6, 1944.


=== Modern day ===

In 1998, the city had 24,700 inhabitants.Now part of Belarus, the name Kojdanava (Belarusian: Койданава) is becoming popular again (it is the official name for the railway station of Dziarzhynsk), but the official name remains unchanged.
