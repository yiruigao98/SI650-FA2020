This is a list of cities and towns in Niger. All larger cities are also Communes of Niger.  While often translated as "town", Nigerien communes are simply the third level administrative subdivision of the nation. These can be classified Urban or Rural communes, and while often the administrative unit of a town or city, all areas of the country fall within a commune. Smaller towns and neighborhoods are designated Quarters (Urban) or Villages (Rural).
