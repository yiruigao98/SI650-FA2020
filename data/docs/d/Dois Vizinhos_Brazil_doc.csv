Population

Dois Vizinhos went through different periods in their development. In the decade of 1950 to 1960, there was intense population and significant population growth. The population, generally speaking, is made up of immigrants from Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul descendants of predominantly Italian immigrants, followed by Poles, Germans and Japanese individuals.
From the 1970s, there was a population decrease of 8.76% of the rural population in relation to its totality, while the urban population grew up to 193.89% in relation to its total population. The decrease of the rural population is due to the factors of the agricultural mechanization that caused the rural exodus, contributed to both the drought that occurred from December 77 to May 78. Urban population growth is justified by the growth of cities themselves, by the development of industry and commerce. In the [1980s] we had a decrease of 5.42% in the total population, and the rural population decreased by 40.39%, a decrease that occurred due to several factors: dry (drought) from December 85 to January 1986 and July 1988. Causing severe damage to agricultural production. Contrary to the decrease of the rural population, the urban population grew 8.51% in relation to its total population. This factor also justifies the strong rural exodus. In the 1990s, another significant factor changed the population scenario, when in 1993, the physical-territorial dismemberment of the administrative districts of Cruzeiro do Iguaçu and Boa Esperança do Iguaçu occurred.
