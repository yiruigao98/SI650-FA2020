=== In Turkey ===
In order to Turkefy the local population, in June 1927 the Law 1164 was passed which allowed the creation of Inspectorates-General (Turkish: Umumi Müffetişlik, UM). The Diyarbakır province was therefore included in the so-called First Inspectorate General (Turkish: Birinci Umumi Müffetişlik), which span over the provinces of Hakkâri, Siirt, Van, Mardin, Bitlis, Sanlıurfa, Elaziğ and Diyarbakır.The first UM was created on the 1 January 1928 and centered in Diyarbakır. The UM was governed by an Inspector General, who governed with a wide-ranging authority over civilian, juridical and military matters. The office of the Inspector General was dissolved in 1952 during the government of the Democrat Party. The Diyarbakır province though was still banned for foreign citizens until 1965. Within the policy of turkification, during the 1930s, several place-names in the province were renamed into names which denoted a Turkish origin.


==== Modern history ====
From 1987 to 2002, Diyarbakir Province was part of the OHAL (State of emergency) region which was declared to counter the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and governed by a so called Supergovernor who got invested with additional powers than a normal Governor. In 1987 he was given the power to relocate and resettle whole villages, settlements and hamlets. In December 1990 with the Decree No. 430, the supergovernor and the provincial governors in the OHAL region received immunity against any legal prosecution in connections with actions they made due to the powers they received with the Decree No. 430.
