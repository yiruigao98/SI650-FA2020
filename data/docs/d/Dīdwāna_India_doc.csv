In the course of time, this city was destroyed by the attacks of the Kshatrapas.According to another inscription, Nagabhatta II donated 1/6 of the Didwana region to a Brahmin in 843 AD in the ninth century. Dedushah, son of Prime Minister Sesharam of the same region, resettled the city at the present place under the name Deduvanak, which was later called Didwana. After this, its rule passed to the Pratiharas of Mandore. The statue of Pratihara Kalin Narayan was received from Didwana which is currently kept in Jodhpur Museum.
During this time, Didwana also became the center of Jainism and Hinduism, but due to the Muslim invasions, the ancient temples were destroyed here. Even today, in the old city, there are pieces and sculptures of temples found in the excavation. In the tenth century, the Jain monk, Jineshwar Suri, composed the story in Didwana.Renowned Jain scholar Sridatta Suri traveled to Didwana and preached to Yashobhadra, the ruler here.
