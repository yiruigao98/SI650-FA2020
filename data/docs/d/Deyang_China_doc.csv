Deyang (simplified Chinese: 德阳; traditional Chinese: 德陽; pinyin: Déyáng) is a prefecture-level city of Sichuan province, People's Republic of China. Deyang is a wealthy, mostly industrial city, with the Erzhong Heavy Machinery Company (中国二重), Dongfang Electrical Company (东方电机), and the high-tech industry contributing to its economy. It had a population of around 3,810,000 in 2004 and an area of 5,818 km2 (2,246 sq mi).Less than one hour from the provincial capital of Chengdu, Deyang is known for a liquor factory called jiannanchun in the county-level city of Mianzhu and the Sanxingdui museum in Guanhan City (county-level) about the ancient Shu culture famous for its bronze mask. Deyang's main city of Jinyang is based on the Jinghu River passing under seven bridges flowing north to south. The river has been widened, five of the bridges are part dams, and it has assumed the name of Jinghu Lake. The city boasts Confucian temples and a stone sculpture park, the east mountains and lake areas. Countryside in all directions leads to rural villages.
Although Deyang is primarily based on industry, it is remarkably clean (and well known throughout Sichuan Province for it) with the local government vigilant. Air quality is very high being supplied with breezes coming from the immediate east mountain ranges and large expanse of countryside. With the high turnover of industry, many businessmen visit so there are many established accommodation options, with hotels in restaurants in all price categories. Transport is well serviced with an extensive bus service and routes and taxis.


== Earthquake ==
On May 12, 2008, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake occurred. An estimated 90,000 people were killed or still missing with an estimated 400,000 injured. Around 5 million were effected through property losses, many left homeless. Schools in Mianzhu and Shifang collapsed.Deyang county has mostly recovered from the devastation of the 2008 earthquake with most people now compensated where required (injuries, etc.) and established in new houses. In some cases they are in new areas, as well as factories and work being re-established. For the new houses, in most cases, the owners are requested to meet 30% of the cost while the government covers the rest. While the government didn't meet its initial (and ambitious) one-year plan to rehouse all victims, it did manage to mostly be successful within two years. In the meantime, residents lived in government-provided mobile home type cities with weekly cash payments for all victims to purchase food and clothing.
