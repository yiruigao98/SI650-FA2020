The Moreton Bay Region is a local government area in the north of the Brisbane metropolitan area in South East Queensland, Australia. Established in 2008, it replaced three established local government areas, the City of Redcliffe and the Shires of Pine Rivers and Caboolture.
With an estimated operating budget of A$391 million and a 2018 population of 459,585, Moreton Bay Region is the third largest local government area in Australia behind the City of Brisbane and City of Gold Coast, both of which are also amalgamated entities.


== History ==
Jandai (also known as Janday, Jandewal, Djendewal, Jundai, Goenpul and Jandawal) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages of the Moreton Bay Region in South-East Queensland. The Jandai language region is centred on Stradbroke Island, which falls within the local government boundaries of Redland City.Duungidjawu (also known as Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Duungidjawu country. The Duungidjawu language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Somerset Region and Moreton Bay Region, particularly the towns of Caboolture, Kilcoy, Woodford and Moore.Prior to 2008, the new Moreton Bay Region was an entire area of three previous and distinct local government areas:

the City of Redcliffe;
the Shire of Pine Rivers;
and the Shire of Caboolture.At the time the Divisional Boards Act 1879 came into force on 11 November 1879, the present Morton Bay Region was entirely contained within the Caboolture Division, which also included the Sunshine Coast. By 1890, Caboolture Division had shrunk considerably with the separate incorporation of the Pine Division (21 January 1888), Redcliffe Division (5 April 1888) and Maroochy Division (5 July 1890).
With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, Caboolture, Pine and Redcliffe (as well as Maroochy) became Shires on 31 March 1903. Redcliffe was proclaimed a Town on 28 May 1921 and a City on 13 June 1959. A few weeks earlier, on 23 May 1959, Pine was renamed the Shire of Pine Rivers.
In July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released its report and recommended that the three areas amalgamate. It argued that the area was part of the South East Queensland Regional Plan's Urban Footprint, and would attract 11% of the region's population and housing growth to 2006. A very strong community of interest was identified through the region's links and dependencies to Brisbane. The councils disagreed with the Commission's plans although, with the exception of Redcliffe, did not oppose alternative amalgamation options. On 15 March 2008, the City and Shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council. In 2012, following the election of the LNP state government, Redcliffe sought to enter a de-amalgamation process; however, a deadline to gather signatures on a petition by 29 August 2012 was missed. The Hills District sought in 2011 to transfer to Brisbane City Council, but the local government Change Commissioner declined the proposal on cost grounds.

== Unitywater ==
On 1 July 2010, Moreton Bay Regional Council's Water Services (along with Sunshine Coast Regional Council), moved over to the recently created water body, Unitywater. Unitywater was created by the Queensland Government as part of the State's takeover of South East Queensland's water facilities, dams and water supply networks. Moreton Bay, Sunshine Coast Regional Council and Noosa Shire Council are joint owners of Unitywater.
