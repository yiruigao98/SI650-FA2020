== Early life ==
Depew was born on April 23, 1834, to Isaac Depew (1800–1869) and Martha Minot (Mitchell) Depew (1810–1885). His father was a merchant and farmer; pioneer in river transportation between Peekskill and New York; son of Abraham Depew, who served in the Revolutionary Army, and Catherine (Crankheit) Depew, great-grandson of Captain James Cronkite of the Continental Army; descendant of François DuPuy, a French Huguenot, who came to America about 1661, settled first in Brooklyn, N.

Justus Mitchell (BA 1776); great-granddaughter of the Rev. Josiah Sherman (B A.

=== Legal career ===
After graduating from Yale, Depew entered the office of Edward Wells, a lawyer in Peekskill, as a student. Depew then read law with William Nelson of Peekskill, New York, from 1856–58. He was admitted to the bar in March 1858; opened an office and practiced in Peekskill until 1861. For a few months, Depew engaged in the brokerage business in New York City as a member of the firm Depew & Potter, but then resumed his law practice in Peekskill. Depew later moved to New York City. During the American Civil War, Depew served as Adjutant of the 18th Regiment, New York National Guard, and later Colonel and Judge Advocate of the 5th Division, on the staff of Major General James W. Husted of the New York Guard.In 1865 Depew was appointed and confirmed United States Minister to Japan, but declined the appointment to pursue his career as a railroad and business lawyer.


=== Railroad lawyer ===
In 1866, Depew became the attorney for New York & Harlem Railroad. Three years later he took the same position for the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. Having earned recognition for his work with subsidiary companies of the Vanderbilt roads, in 1876 Depew became general counsel and director of the whole "Vanderbilt System." Six years later he began serving on the executive board of the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad and also became its second vice president. In 1885, Depew was elected that railroad's president and served in that capacity until 1898 when he was succeeded by Samuel R. Callaway. Depew then became chairman of board of directors of New York Central Railroad Company.
While Depew was active in the Vanderbilt railroads in and through New York, he held concurrent positions with many other railroads and companies. He was president of West Shore Railroad. He served on the boards of directors for the New York and Harlem Railroad, the Chicago and North Western Railway, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, the New Jersey Junction Railroad, the St. Lawrence and Adirondack Railroad, the Wallkill Valley Railroad, the Canada Southern Railroad.
Aside from railroads, Depew also served on the boards of directors for Western Union, the Hudson River Bridge Company, the Niagara River Bridge Company, the New York State Realty & Terminal Company, the Union Trust Company, Equitable Life Assurance Company, and Kensico Cemetery Association.


=== Politics ===

Depew served in the New York State Assembly (Westchester County, 3rd District) in 1862 and 1863. During the latter year, he sometimes acted as Speaker pro tempore while Speaker Theophilus C. Callicot was under investigation. From 1864 to 1865, he was Secretary of State of New York, elected in 1863 on the Union ticket.
In 1867, Depew became clerk of Westchester County but resigned after a short service. In 1870 the New York Legislature named Depew Immigration Commissioner, but he declined to serve. Depew had also been commissioner of quarantine and president of Court of Claims of New York City as well as commissioner of taxes and assessments for the city and county of New York. Depew was one of the commissioners appointed to build the state capitol 1874;  and a member of the state's boundary commission in 1875.
Depew was defeated for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the Liberal Republican-Democratic ticket in 1872. Nine years later, Depew became a candidate for U.S. Senator in an 1881 special election, but withdrew after the 41st ballot. He also declined nomination as a senator in 1885; but was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1899, and re-elected in 1905, and served from March 4, 1899, to March 3, 1911.
The late Senator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma once quoted Chauncey Depew in an attack on a Senator from Indiana, "As I gaze on the ample figure of my friend from Indiana, and as I listen to him," Kerr began, "I am reminded of Chauncey Depew who said to the equally obese William Howard Taft at a dinner before the latter became President, 'I hope, if it is a girl, Mr. Taft will name it for his charming wife.' "To which Taft responded, 'if it is a girl, I shall, of course, name it for my lovely helpmate of many years. And if it is a boy, I shall claim the father's prerogative and name it Junior. But if, as I suspect, it is only a bag of wind, I shall name it Chauncey Depew.'"Depew stumped the state of New York for John C. Frémont in 1856 and for Abraham Lincoln in 1860.  He served as a delegate-at-large to Republican National Conventions 1888-1904 and delegate to all following conventions, including 1928, being elected the day before he died.  He made the nomination speeches for Harrison in 1892, Governor Morton in 1896, and Fairbanks in 1904.  At the convention in 1888, Depew received 99 votes for the presidential nomination, and in 1892 declined an appointment as Secretary of State in Harrison's cabinet.
On October 7, 1897, Depew inaugurated the New York pneumatic tube mail, declaring: "This is the age of speed. Everything that makes for speed contributes to happiness and is a distinct gain to civilization. We are ahead of the old countries in almost every respect, but we have been behind in methods of communication within our cities. In New York this condition of communication has hitherto been barbarous. If the Greater New York is to be a success, quick communication is absolutely necessary. I hope this system we have seen tried here to-day will soon be extended over all the Greater New York."In 1898, Depew nominated Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York at the Republican state convention.
In 1906, David Graham Phillips began a muckraking series entitled "The Treason of the Senate" for William Randolph Hearst's new Cosmopolitan magazine, and targeted Depew in the first article. The article's sensational charges included labeling Depew a "boodler" owned "mentally and morally" by railroad magnates Cornelius and William Vanderbilt. The piece provoked outrage from groups as diverse as President Roosevelt, the New York Sun and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.


== Personal life ==

Depew married twice. On November 9, 1871, he married Elise Ann Hegeman (1848–1893) in New York City. She was the daughter of William and Eliza Jane (Nevin) Hegeman. Before her death on May 7, 1893, they had one son, Chauncey Mitchell Depew, Jr. (1879–1931), who died unmarried.On December 27, 1901, he married May Eugenie Palmer (1866–1940) in Nice, France.  She was the daughter of Henry and Alice (Hermann) Palmer.  In 1929, May Palmer-Depew donated the papers of her late husband to George Washington University, as well as $120,000 to establish a department of public speaking in her husband's memory.  The collection is currently cared for by the university's Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.Depew was the paternal uncle of Ganson and Chauncey Depew, sons of his brother William Beverly Depew. Ganson Depew became a vice president of the Buffalo & Susquehanna Coal Company; after marrying Grace Goodyear he became the personal assistant of his father-in-law Frank Henry "F.H." Goodyear (who was the president of the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad). They had two children, Ganson, who died as a young man and Lucia Depew. Lucia married Edward deCernea and had two daughters,  Grace de Cernea and Patricia Parkinson.  Grace married Scott Reiniger and had four children, Daphne, Scott, Karen and Harlan. 
Nephew Chauncey DePew worked for the Vanderbilt Railway Systems like his uncle, and married Julia Catlin Park, but later divorced.
In spring 1928, as he was returning from Florida to Manhattan, he became ill and died of bronchial pneumonia, a week later, on April 5, 1928, in Manhattan.  He was buried in the family mausoleum in Hillside Cemetery, Peekskill. In his honor, the huge concourse of Grand Central Terminal was draped in mourning.

=== Legacy ===

In 1908, Depew gave land to Peekskill, New York, which became Depew Park, and a decade later expanded the donation by 10 acres (40,000 m2) acres, and also paid for a statue of himself for display in that park.
The Village of Depew, New York, incorporated in 1894 located along the New York Central Railroad main line just outside of Buffalo, New York, was named after him. The town of Depew, Oklahoma, is also named for him.Many artists painted Depew, including George Burroughs Torrey. The Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury painted Depew numerous times, including in 1889-90. The three-quarter length portrait of Depew seated on a bale of furs which was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1890, is now in the Yale Club of New York City. Several other portraits followed including a portrait painted for the New York State Capitol at Albany showing Depew as he was in 1863 (now New York State Museum). The artist gave a bust-length portrait to the Museum at Peekskill in 1918. Muller-Ury made an etching of Depew (copies, signed by the artist and the sitter, are in the American National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, and in the collection of the Newport Preservation Society Rhode Island, and University of Cincinnati College of Design). Muller-Ury also painted Depew's first wife in 1893, and his second wife in 1902 in 18th-century costume.
The Chauncey M. DePew was a ship named in his honor. The vessel was built for the Maine Central Railroad Company in 1913 to carry passengers to Bar Harbor. She worked along the Maine coast until 1925 when she was sold to the Day Line as an excursion boat between New York and Albany. In 1940 she was drafted to carry men and supplies between New York City and Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook. In 1950, she was sold to the government of Bermuda and spent the next 20 years as a ship's tender, harbor ferry, cruise ship and pilot boat. Back in the States, in 1971, a storm slammed her against a breakwater in Chesapeake Bay, where she lay for three years. She was refurbished and moored in the Hackensack River between Harmon Cove and the Hackensack River Route 3 Bridge, 
 Another boat, a tugboat that was part of New York Central, was also named for him.Today: Decendant, Liz Harlan(Woodbury), daughter of Karen Reiniger is currently a model with Elite Model Management in New York City.
