=== Urban development ===
Dharuhera is about a 40-minute drive from Gurgaon and 60 minutes from Indira Gandhi International Airport. Due to its proximity to Gurgaon and New Delhi, Dharuhera had all the makings of the next big satellite city in the region, with a number of developers running projects here, but it has been deprived by the short sightedness of the Haryana Urban Development  Authority (HUDA). The town lacks good public sector healthcare, educational institutes, recreational centres, public spaces, leisure parks, libraries, art galleries, places for performing arts, stadiums, swimming pools, theatres, multiplex (one is coming up at Bestech city), and parking spaces in markets. It even lacks a proper crematorium or burial ground. To be fair to Dharuhera, the town planners in Haryana are generally regarded  as incompetent and have done no damage to their reputation as probably the worst town planners in the country. The town lacks adequate drainage facilities and usually the parts near the NH-48 and Bhiwadi are submerged  even after the slightest rain, due to planning mistakes.  But lack of affordable real estate in National Capital Region has made people overlook these problems and it remains one of the  most promising real estates in not only NCR but the whole of India.= PTRADITION =
