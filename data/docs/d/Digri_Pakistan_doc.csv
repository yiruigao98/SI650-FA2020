== Communities ==
Digri is a culturally diverse town. As the small town has grown rapidly in the last few decades, the diversity has also increased with Sindhi, baloch, Punjabi, and pashtoons living there. 85% of the population of Digri are Sindhi. The most common languages in the town are Sindhi, Urdu and Punjabi. In the early era of the town committee, Talpurs were in control of the committee, but they lost power due to internal strife in the Sindhi community, in favour of the Mir Hayat Khan Talpur. There was a migration of educated Lagharis families from Sanghar, Nawabshah, Badin and Mirpur Khas to the Rahim Yar Khan.
Balochs and Jadgals live in ward #9 of the Baloch Colony, and to a lesser extent in ward #11 of Mir Feteh Town, Yousafabad. The leader of the Baloch and Jadgal community is Sardar Naveed Jadgal Baloch, District Vice-President of the Pakistan People's Party.
Most of the Punjabi families in Digri are living in the Yosafabad and Ghareebabad colonies as well as Alabaad colony. A not-for-profit organization, Research to Organize Sustainable Empowerment (ROSE), is operating in the town for the development of Digri.
Digri is ruled by the Pakistan People's Party.


== Economy ==
Livestock and poultry rearing, agricultural farms, and transportation are the main sources of income, while more than 20% population rely on government and private jobs. A sugar mill, Dhigri Sugar Mills, provides further job opportunities for local people.
