Dosquebradas (Spanish pronunciation: [doskeˈβɾaðas]) is the second largest city and a municipality in the Risaralda Department, Colombia. As of 2019, it had a population of approximately 207,000 inhabitants. The city is connected by the César Gaviria Trujillo Viaduct to Pereira, the capital of the department.
The name of the city literally means "two creeks" (dos quebradas), Santa Teresita and Las Garzas. Dosquebradas is sometimes called the Pink Zone (Zona Rosa) of Pereira because it has many nightclubs and bars, which are filled with young people on the weekends.
It grew up as an industrial center serving Pereira in the 1970s and 1980s.  With the construction of El Poblado neighborhood (low-income housing) it experienced a population boom, providing residence to many families that commuted to Pereira for work.
