Dasmariñas, officially the City of Dasmariñas (Tagalog: Lungsod ng Dasmariñas), is a 1st class city in the province of Cavite, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 659,019 people.Nicknamed Dasma, it has a land area of 90.1 square kilometers (34.8 sq mi)  and is located 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Manila. The growing congestion and outward urban expansion of the Metropolitan Manila Area has led to rapid development of the city. This inevitable growth is manifested by the influx of industries, the presence of large educational and health institutions, and the growing number of subdivisions accommodating its growing population.


== Etymology ==
Dasmariñas was named after Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the 7th Spanish governor-general of the Philippines who served from 1590 to 1593. After his death, his son Luis Pérez Dasmariñas became the governor-general from 1593 to 1596. Pérez Dasmariñas came from San Miguel das Negradas of Viveiro, in Galicia, Spain.
Dasmariñas literally means "from As Mariñas" (coastal region of Lugo combining the comarcas of A Mariña Occidental, A Mariña Central and A Mariña Oriental), coming itself from mariño ("of the coast, seaside or shore" in the Galician language, the native tongue from Viveiro Galicia, Spain), and this from mar ("sea").


== History ==


=== Foundation ===
In the 19th century during the Spanish Colonial Period, Dasmariñas was originally called Tampus meaning "end of the forest." In the beginning stages, it was a part of its mother town of Imus (now City of Imus). It was once a part of a vast Recollect Hacienda that supported all the various missionary activities of the Recollects in the Philippines and in Spain.On April 9, 1864, a council composed of the Archbishop of Manila, the politico military governor of Cavite, the Prior Provincial of the Augustinian Recollect Order and the parish priest of Imus met to discuss the creation of the new town and parish separated from Imus. At that time, there were only 643 inhabitants in Tampus, the heart of the community. After thorough discussions, the Gobierno Civil Superior of the Islands approved the creation of the new town on May 12, 1864 with Don Juan Ramirez elected as gobernadorcillo (town head).An ensemble of nipa houses in the other barrios of the hacienda like Malinta, Nancaan, Salacay, Paliparan, Malagasang and Salitran were grouped and migrated into a reduccion (reduction) in Tampus in 1866. Reduccion  originally meant the religious and civic aspects of missionary activities. Later it came to mean the process of resettling and unifying a community, thereby creating a newly organized town. For the Spanish missionaries and friars, this process was advantageous not only for evangelization but also for bringing people under the Spanish rule. A new town called Tampus was formed. From that time on, the people of Tampus built their houses within the hearing distance of the church bells – "bajo las toques de campana". The new town could be reached through a good network of roads and bridges built by the best architects and engineers of the Recollect Order.In the same year, the new town was rechristened Perez-Dasmariñas to honor the 7th Governor General of the Philippines, Don Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas (1590–1593). Governor Dasmariñas, a Knight of Santiago, was a native of Galicia, Spain and a former magistrate of Murcia and Cartagena, Spain who brought a lot of economic improvements during the early days of colonization.
Toward the end of 1866, the new town Perez-Dasmariñas had complied with the requirements of a typical Philippine town. A spacious town plaza at the center of the town with the church and the convent made of stone and bricks, a casa tribunal (courthouse) made of wood and nipa, a primary school for children and various houses made of nipa were built in designated areas. A cemetery was located around 200 yards away from the church and surrounded with wooden fence.The foundation of the town Perez-Dasmariñas was unique from most other towns of Cavite. For the first time, a town was created not by a preceding petition of the barrio people and its local officials as required by legal procedures and custom at that time. Instead, high ranking church officials and the Cavite politico military governor were the prime initiators of its foundation.For the sake of the people of the growing town and for their own interest, the Recollects sent a petition to Madrid for the creation of a new parish of Dasmariñas, independent from Imus. Queen Isabella II signed the Royal Order creating the new parish of Perez-Dasmariñas on October 21, 1866. The following year, the construction of the stone parish church of Dasmariñas dedicated to the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Immaculate Conception was started.


=== Barrios ===
The old town of Perez-Dasmariñas was made up of several barrios. Salitran was considered the most important and famous during the Spanish regime because it was the site of the Recollect casa hacienda (estate house). Salitran came from the Tagalog word "sal-it" meaning "people from another town". It was also once named as Bayanan because of the large concentration of people there. Since it was a part of the Recollect Hacienda de Imus, there were many people from different provinces who lived there working as farmhands. Layong Iloko, a place in Salitran, strengthens the belief that there were Ilocanos who settled there. Pasong Santol in Salitran got its name because of the abundance of santol trees.Tampus, the center of the newly formed town was located at the end of the deep forest in contrast with one of the sitios which was called "Pintong Gubat" or "gate of the forest". Sometimes, the name of a barrio is taken from its location, as in the case of Barrio Burol which suggests the high location of the barrio. Sabang on the other hand means "crossroad" or "crossing". Barrio Salawag is believed to be the old barrio Salacay. The word "salawag" refers to long bamboo poles to which nipa roofing are tied up. Salawag is sometimes also called "crossing" because it serves as a crossroad between Paliparan and Salitran.Nancaan, now called Langkaan, was derived from the Tagalog word "langka" (jackfruit). It is the biggest fruit tree in the Philippines which was reportedly brought from India to Malaysia and found its way to our country. The presence of lot of jackfruit trees may be the reason it was called Nancaan.Malinta or Malintaan, on the other hand was derived from the Tagalog word "linta" which means leech. The abundance of leeches in the place accounted for its name.
On July 18, 1899, three more sitios of Perez-Dasmariñas were raised to the rank of barrios. Barrio Sampaloc owing to the abundance of tamarind trees in the place; barrio Tamban was renamed San Jose and Barrio Lucsuhin became San Agustin.


=== The 1896 Philippine Revolution ===
By June 1896, the Spanish authorities in Cavite province had become suspicious of the local elite's activities. There were alleged top hierarchy meetings of the Recollects in the casa hacienda of Salitran and San Nicolas. Included in the meeting were General Bernardo Echaluce and other top military officials. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether it was just to apprehend the notable elites who were "Masons". At the time, "Masons" were bitter enemies of the church and their liberal ideas coming from their counterpart in Spain were beginning to awaken the natives to fight for their rights and even for their freedom. Fortunately for the elites, no decision was during the meeting. Thus, the local leaders freely but quietly continued their subversive activities.As soon as the revolution of 1896 broke out, leaders of Perez-Dasmariñas took no time in taking up arms against the Spanish rule. Don Placido Campos, the gobernadorcillo at the time and Don Francisco Barzaga, the municipal secretary, gathered the people to liberate their town from Spanish control at the beginning of September 1896. They captured the casa tribunal and casa hacienda in Salitran, killing the religious clergies who lived there. Eventually, the town was freed.As towns in Cavite fell into the hands of Filipino revolutionaries, the Spanish government in Madrid felt that Governor General Ramon Blanco's offensive against the natives was ineffective. Thus, a more aggressive person took over the command of the islands, Camilo de Polavieja, with Gen. José de Lachambre as the head of the campaign. Gradually, the Spaniards regained the control of the province. After the fall of Silang, the Spaniards turned their eyes to Perez-Dasmariñas. Knowing the strength of resistance he might encounter, Gen. Lechambre decided to surround the whole town. He sent to advance units headed by Brigadier Gen. Jose Molina who went to take the left. The troop under Col. Arutos who had taken Paliparan, went westward to cut the escape of the Filipinos to Imus and Carmona. Gen. Lechambre sent the main force toward the south.The Caviteños suffered terrible defeat because of lack of arms and ammunition. As the Spaniards approached the Poblacion, the revolutionaries retreated the stone building of the town. On February 25, 1897, the Spaniards decided to encircle the Poblacion rather go directly to the interior. They started burning all houses except the church. Seeing they were surrounded by fire, some of the rebels went out of hiding but were immediately met by open fire. Those who took refuge at the casa tribunal refused to come out and were all burned alive. Even those who took refuge in the church did eventually yield to the advancing Spanish forces. By March, Perez-Dasmariñas had fallen back into the Spanish hand.Then Lechambre returned to Salitran. He was expecting a heavy resistance from the revolutionaries who occupied the casa hacienda but to his great surprise, they were able to take the place without any resistance. They hoisted the red and gold flag of Spain and converted it as their headquarters.However, news came that there was a heavy concentration of Filipino rebels at Pasong Santol a short distance beyond Salitran. The Battle of Pasong Santol was one of the most significant in the Caviteños' desire to keep their province under their control. It was the bloodiest battle fought in Cavite. It was during these series of battles in Cavite when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo was elected in absentia as President of the newly formed revolutionary government. While some leaders of Magdalo faction of the Katipunan were busy fighting in Pasong Santol, members of the Magdiwang and Magdalo faction were discussing the form of government and elected its officers in the Tejeros Convention in Rosario, Cavite. In said Convention, Bonifacio was traitorously ousted from the Katipunan leadership by the combined Caviteño revolutionaries. Bonifacio and his brother Procopio were later executed by Aguinaldo's men.The Filipino casualties was enormous according to Lachambre. There were 150 men inside the "tribunal" or town hall when Spaniards set fire to the building and all 150 were killed. Others took refuge in the convent. This also was set on fire and the men were shot as they emerged. Others had shut themselves up in the church. With the church surrounded, the mountain artillery was brought up into position and from a distance of 35 meters, the strong doors of the church were bombarded and the troops went in through the breach. At the height of the Battle of Perez Dasmarinas, Gen. Flaviano Yengko, Gen. Crispulo Aguinaldo, Lucas Camerino, Arturo Reyes and many more revolutionaries lost their lives fighting for their motherland.


=== The American (Commonwealth) Colonial Era ===
With the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898 (ratified Washington on February 6, 1899), the Philippines was ceded to America by Spain. The American regime brought to Dasmariñas, as it did to other parts of the country, several fundamental changes in the system of government, in language, and in educational system.In the month of February 1899, the Philippine-American War began. General Henry Ware Lawton's brigade operated south of Manila including the province of Cavite in the middle of June 1899. The Americans could not land directly at Bacoor because Zapote river was defended by the Filipino revolutionists who built trenches as tactical defenses forming three sides of an angle which made the Filipinos hardly visible. The American's 14th Infantry Battalion swam across the during the Battle of Zapote River and under the cover of military artillery, charged against the Filipinos who then retreated to the woods.Moving southward, the Americans encountered more Filipino revolutionists in the town of Bacoor, Imus and Perez-Dasmariñas, a battalion of infantry narrowly escaped annihilation. News had been brought to the American camp that the Filipino soldiers had evacuated the town and that the native mayor was disposed to surrender it formally to the Americans. The battalion thus went there to take possession, but before reaching the place, the Filipino revolutionists closed in on all sides, and a heavy firefight went on for hours. The Americans were saved from destruction by a desperate bayonet charge when they were rescued by General Weaton's brigade.Placido Campos, who sided with General Emilio Aguinaldo since the beginning of the Filipino-American war in 1899, was captured together with his nephew Guillermo Campos. They were imprisoned at the Provost Political Prison on Postigo St., Intramuros, Manila where they were kept for six months.The Americans established the Military Government in 1900. By order of the Colonel of the American Battalion stationed in Perez-Dasmariñas, the residents of the town nominated a president and a vice-president. Elected through the raising of hands were Francisco Barzaga as president and Conrado Malihan as vice-president. They served their office until the civil government was established by the Americans in 1901.On January 31, 1901, in accordance with President McKinley's instructions that the Filipinos be allowed to manage their own municipal governments, the Second Philippine Commission enacted the Act Number 82, the new Municipal Code, placing each municipal government under the following officials: the municipal president, the vice-president, and the municipal council, who were elected by qualified voters every two years. In line with this, Placido Campos was again elected as the head of the municipality of Perez-Dasmariñas in October 1901. Francisco Barzaga then became the Treasurer of Dasmariñas. The two were re-elected in 1903.In 1903, the American government made the first census in the Philippines. Francisco Barzaga and the secretary, Esteban Quique, made census enumerators for Perez-Dasmariñas under the leadership of Placido Campos. When the census was finished, the total population of the town was only 3,500. Before the revolution of 1898, the population was 12,000. (There were 20 Cabezas de Barangay (barangay head) and each of which had 200 persons with ages ranging from 18 to 59 years, men and women, the number of children estimated at 6,000 giving a total of 12,000.) Comparing the population prior to the revolution with that of 1948, there has been a decrease in the population of Perez-Dasmariñas. The 1948 census accounted to only 9,700 while that of the pre-revolutionary period totaled 12,000.From 1905 to 1916, the law which was passed in 1901 took effect. It combined the municipalities of Imus, Perez-Dasmariñas and Bacoor into one, with the seat of government located at Imus. Consequently, on January 5, 1905, Perez-Dasmariñas became a part of Imus. The reason for this was to punish the insurrectos for not surrendering. Besides, the inability of the people to work outside from fear of being suspected by the Constabulary greatly decrease the income of the municipalities to the detriment of the employees and the policemen.In 1917, under Governor General Francis Burton Harrison (1913–1921), Perez-Dasmariñas was again declared a separate municipality. The provincial governor of Cavite, Antero S. Soriano, convened the local leaders, including Placido Campos, Francisco Barzaga, and Felipe Tirona. Together, they agreed to delete the word "Perez" and retain "Dasmariñas" as the new name of the town. For the second time, Placido Campos headed the rechristened town of Dasmariñas.


=== World War II: The Japanese Occupation and Liberation ===
The town of Dasmariñas is a town in the province of Cavite that shed blood and has given up many lives for national independence. There were many times when the Japanese conducted zonifications in the town. The barrios of Paliparan and Salawag suffered the most number of deaths. Being remote places and thinking that guerrillas were hiding there, these two barrios were zonified two times giving up several lives. The Japanese Imperial Army made the schools as their garrison.Meanwhile, after surviving in the Bataan Death March and released from Capas, Tarlac Concenration Camp, General Mariano Castañeda returned to Cavite and helped organized the resistance movement in Dasmarinas headed by Col. Estanislao Mangubat-Carungcong of the 4th Infantry Regiment (Camp Neneng Dasmarinas) and Col.

After the assault, Dasmarinas town became too hot to the Japanese because of the active guerilla activities and headquarters of the guerillas in Neneng Dasmarinas, and because of the Sakdalistas and Makapili (Japanese collaborators) denouncing and reporting all guerilla activities of Col. Estanislao M. Carungcong to the Kempeitai (Japanese Military Police) in exchange for payments and privileges and because of it the Kempeitai made another zonification on July 25, 1943 in the town proper until Dasmariñeo guerilla regimental staff Lt. Col. Jose M. Carungcong, Major Dominador I. Mangubat, Capt. Elpidio Mangubat-Barzaga Sr., Capt. Jovito Evangelista were captured and imprisoned for 2 months in Muntinglupa, Rizal prison camp until they are released except Lt.Col. Jose M. Carungcong who was sentenced to 6 years in prison.
On June 24, 1944 The Hunters ROTC guerillas headed by Col. Emmanuel De Ocampo, Lt. Col Vic Estacio and Col. Eleuterio Terry Adevoso raided the Muntinlupa New Bilibid Prison and rescued many prisoners of war and a good haul of firearms and ammunition among the prisoners was Dasmariñeo guerilla Lt.

On December 17, 1944 at about 01:00 am and lasted at about 18:00 pm around 1,000 Kempeitai (Japanese Military Police)  from Fort Santiago conducted another zonification in the town proper and adjacent barrios. The Church was used as their garrison and all suspected male residents involved or coordinating with the guerrilla movement of Col. E.M.

Women were abducted and raped by the Japanese Soldiers, There were those who experienced the so-called "tinutubig" wherein the head is immersed in a drum of water.On January 15, 1945, the day before the FACGF Gen. Castañeda - U.S 11th Airborne Major Jay Vanderpool conference in Neneng Dasmariñas, when local guerrillas ambushed nine Japanese soldiers inside a jitney in Anabu Road Salitran. The next day, Tuesday January 16, Japanese soldiers retaliated by firing indiscriminately on the town's people of Dasmariñas.
Aside from these, raid after raid were made and male residents were shot to death. Some were killed because they were mistaken as guerrilla members. Some fought face to face, during encounters in Burol, Malinta, Paliparan and Langkaan, others were killed in other towns. Most male residents of Dasmariñas were among those who fought with the Japanese in Bataan and Corregidor island. Sad to state too, there were those who joined the Bataan Death March, some of whom are already dead and some are still living to tell the tale.On January 30, 1945 as Allied forces began to land in Nasugbu, Batangas, the Dasmariñeo guerilla force of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Col.

Dasmariñas has a long list of heroes who sacrificed their lives for their homeland during the turbulent period of the Second World War and the period of liberation.


=== Post-war era and before cityhood ===
After the war, the Philippines became independent and Dasmariñas started to develop. The population increased because of the mass exodus of families from Metro Manila and nearby provinces.The Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan (DBB), also known as Dasmariñas Resettlement Area, was established in 1975 by Letter of Instruction No. 19 issued by the then President Ferdinand Marcos.
From 1983 onwards Dasmariñas had an economic boom. Different factories and establishments sprouted in the town which gave way for the growth in population. From a sixth-class municipality, the town became a first-class municipality.As of 2015, the city has a population in excess of over 650,000. Dasmariñas served as a catalyst for major economic development and sustained growth for the Metro Manila urban area since the 1990s. The influx of industries, academia, and real estate developments is significant of in a town outside of a major financial district. Located at Dasmariñas are the First Cavite Industrial Estate with 81 foreign and domestic corporations employing 20,000,. The city also hosts one of the largest universities in Cavite, the De La Salle University-Dasmariñas campus, which serves more than 25, 000 students.


=== Cityhood attempts and present ===
There have been several attempts to convert Dasmariñas into a city. The first attempt was in 1997, when HB08931 was filed by Congressman Renato P. Dragon with other cityhood bills of Imus (HB 08960) and Bacoor (HB 08959). It was filed last February 11, 1997 and read last February 13, 1997. Committee Report N0. 01361 was submitted on December 17, 1997. It was approved on the third reading by the House last January 10, 1998. It did not push through as a Republic Act and no plebiscite happened.
The second attempt was in 2000, when HB099883 was filed by Congressman Erineo Maliksi last March 13, 2000. It was first read last March 13, 2000. It was approved on the Second and Third reading of House last March 15, 2000 and March 27, 2000. It was transmitted to the senate on March 28, 2000 and received on March 31, 2009. It did not push through as a Republic Act and no plebiscite happened.
The idea of converting Dasmariñas into a component city was again proposed for the third time after failure in 1997 and 2000.
House Bill no. 5258 converting the municipality of Dasmariñas into a component city was filed by Congressman Elpidio F. Barzaga, Jr. last October 3, 2008. It was read last October 6, 2008. It was approved by the House on Second and Third Reading on October 7 and November 17, 2008. It was transmitted and received by the Senate last November 17 and 20, 2008. It was passed by the senate on Second and Third Reading last October 28 and November 5, 2009. It is received by the President of the Philippines last October 14, 2009 and signed as Republic Act 9723 last October 15, 2009.COMELEC Resolution No. 8682 in connection with the November 25, 2009 plebiscite to ratify the conversion of the municipality of Dasmariñas province of Cavite into a component city pursuant to Republic Act 9723 dated October 15, 2009.Republic Act No. 9723 was ratified by the registered voters of Dasmariñas through a plebiscite conducted last November 25, 2009, converted the municipality of Dasmariñas in the Province of Cavite into a component city to be known as the City of Dasmariñas. There were about 44,000 voters who cast the plebiscite ballot in the town's 1,508 polling precincts. The yes votes won overwhelmingly. The yes votes got 36,559 while the no votes got 8,141.Then Mayor Jennifer Austria-Barzaga, elected in 2007, is both the first woman mayor and first city mayor of Dasmariñas since its incorporation as a city. Since 1892, when Don Placido N. Campos became the first mayor, there have been 23 mayors of the city.
On 2011, the Paro-Paro Festival was first celebrated. It is celebrated every November 26 to commemorate the incorporation of the city of Dasmariñas with people dancing and parading in the streets in butterfly costumes.In November 2013, the Paro-Paro Festival was cancelled, instead the allocated funds will be donated to the Typhoon Yolanda victims.


== Geography ==

Dasmariñas City is about 8,234 hectares, 12 kilometers south of Metro Manila or the National Capital Region and 27 kilometers south of the center of the City of Manila. It is bounded by the city of Imus and the municipality of Silang, both in Cavite at the north and south respectively, at the east by the Cities of San Pedro and Biñan by the side of Laguna and Carmona and at the west, it is bounded by General Trias, also in Cavite and a little further from this boundary is Trece Martires City.It is strategically located at the intermediate zone of the Metropolitan Manila area. With adequate accessibility, Dasmariñas is within the urbanizing development influence of Metro Manila area.
It is composed of the Poblacion and the barangays. The Poblacion which is now divided into four zones is on the westernmost section of the city, Sabang, Salawag and Salitran are to the north and to the south are San Agustin, Langkaan and Sampaloc. Burol, Paliparan, and Bagong Bayan are on the eastern side of the city.
The city of Dasmariñas is landlocked. However, it is not too far from the coastal towns of Rosario, Kawit, Bacoor, Noveleta and Cavite City whose average distance from Poblacion is less than 30 kilometers. It is about the same distance from Laguna de Bay and about 27 kilometers from the resort city of Tagaytay and the famous Taal Lake.
At present, Dasmariñas is served by corridors traversing the central areas which provide linkages to the Metropolitan Manila area core in the north and the developing nodes of Laguna and Batangas.


=== Topography ===
Dasmariñas is partly lowland and partly hill. The Poblacion itself is elevated. From an elevation of 80 meters at the Poblacion, the land rises to 250 meters towards Silang. Generally, land near rivers and creeks are rugged. Dasmariñas is outside the typhoon belt and has no fault line constraints. Further, it is served by natural drainage system since it is traversed by several rivers and water tributaries draining to the Manila Bay. The city has yet to experience floods.Strongly sloping to elevated areas cover approximately 1,532.16 hectares or 18.61% of the total area. These are dispersed among Burol, Langkaan, Paliparan, Salawag, Sampaloc and San Agustin. Areas with slopes 10.1 to 18% cover about 575.72 hectares of land in portions of Salawag, Salitran, Burol, and other parts.
On the other hand, gently sloping or undulating areas comprise merely 710.4 hectares or 8.62% of the total land area while undulating areas with a slope of 2.6 to 5% account for the biggest percentage of 50.59% of the total land area equivalent to 4, 165.64 hectares of land which are dispersed over the municipality except Sabang and San Jose.


=== Climate ===
Dasmariñas has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: Aw) with two pronounced seasons: wet season and dry season. Wet season covers the period from May to December of each year and dry season covers the period from January to April.

 


== Demographics ==
In the 2015 census, the population of Dasmariñas, was 659,019 people, with a density of 7,300 inhabitants per square kilometre or 19,000 inhabitants per square mile.
From the original 643 inhabitants of the old Perez-Dasmariñas, the population grew and so did the town. By 1888, there were already more than 4,576 people living in Perez-Dasmarinas. Gradually, the economic life of the people improved. The inquilinos (lessees) of the hacienda rose to become the middle class. Dasmariñas, 8,664 hectares were all farmed in 1890 except for 3,770 hectares (including parcels at Gatdula and Balimbing). Lessees paid the usual land rent base on the measurement of lowland and upland riceland set up by the "uldog" (friar administrator) of casa hacienda de Salitran. In the 1880s, there were 200 quinones of dry and 50 quinones of wet ricelands yielding some 2,300 cavanas of palay, 5,000 piculs of mucavado sugar, 50 cavans of corn and camote, 60 piculs of tao and 25 piculs of peanuts. Dasmariñas was a highly advanced town where not only textiles from Batangas and Bulacan looms, but also imported European cloth from Manila reached the town elites. Fish and other staple food however still came from nearby towns. Surprisingly until 1880, there was no public market in the town. There was a principal public dirt road in Perez-Dasmariñas that went to Silang which was passable to all kinds of vehicle only during dry season, but reachable only by foot and horseback during wet season. By 1870, mails from Manila were received at a central station in Cavite Puerto where it was sorted. Mails were brought via Kawit, then Imus then Dasmariñas.Culturally, Perez-Dasmariñas was not too behind for by 1874 there were already two competing brass bands in the town. Don Valeriano Campos, an inquilino and a former gobernadorcillo of the town (1879 to 1881) organized one of the brass bands. He was popularly known as Capitang Vale. He was the highest taxpayer and owned a house made of cogon and wood on Calle Real with an appraised value of P300. His son Placido Campos learned his trade and also considered a man of means. Manuela Monzon, another well to do woman owned a house at the town's main street. The house made of nipa and wood was valued at P200 and was rented as a boys' school for P72.Nonetheless in 1892, there was a noticeable decrease of the male population. As conflict between the friar-hacenderos, the inquilinos and casamas multiplied more people went into hiding in the deep forest of Perez-Dasmariñas. The rise of tulisanismo in Cavite was often connected with agrarian problems in the hacienda town owned by the friars.The city has 75 barangays, has more than 170 subdivisions and the biggest resettlement area in the Philippines, the Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan (DBB).Most affluent families from Metro Manila and nearby towns and provinces have chosen Dasmariñas to be their home due to its proximity to the National Capital Region. The mass exodus of people here in Dasmariñas is also brought about by the industrial boom which brought about more jobs. There are also a big number of foreign residents such as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Americans, Hindus, Britons and Eurasians. Because of this, Dasmariñas can be also considered as the "Melting Pot" of Cavite.


=== Religion ===

Christianity is the predominant faith, composed of Roman Catholics, Protestants, and other independent Christian groups.
Majority of the population are Roman Catholics. The city is the seat of the Vicariates of Immaculate Conception and Our Mother of Perpetual Help under the jurisdiction of Diocese of Imus.

== Cityscape ==

The City of Dasmariñas is divided into eleven unofficially-defined administrative districts and is subdivided into 75 barangays.


=== Poblacion ===

The Poblacion is the city center which is home to Dasmariñas' old residents. The newly renovated old church of the Parish of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, Dasmariñas Library, Dasmariñas Elementary School and the Immaculate Conception Academy-Science High School are located in the town's plaza. Municipal Government's municipio or the town hall is located a few meters away from the plaza. Near the Poblacion is the De La Salle University-Health Sciences Campus and the DLSU-Medical Center, the 1st ISO Certified Hospital in the Philippines. Divided into four zones, the town's center is mostly residential area but is still lined with many business establishments. Celebrations, shows and gatherings are being held at the plaza. Every December 8, the town's Poblacion celebrates the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception wherein colorful banderitas, loud marching bands and expectacular display of fireworks are seen and is being visited by many people coming from the different towns in Cavite. Cultural shows and many celebrations are happening here almost weekly so it has the rightful claim to be called "The Liveliest City in Cavite".Five barangays are located in this district.

Zone I
Zone I-A (A stands for Aguinaldo because of its location along Aguinaldo Highway)
Zone II
Zone III
Zone IV


=== San Agustin ===
Kasuyan is its first name of this place, during the Spanish period, because of the presence of many cashew trees on the area. After many years, its name became Luksuhin and on July 18, 1889, it was renamed again by the petition passed by Don Juan Bautista requesting the place be named after San Agustin. The place is lying between the Poblacion and Sampaloc in the north. Farming was the chief source of income of the people here. San Agustin is blessed with rich soil that can be planted with rice, sugarcane, fruits and vegetables. Here, vast lands with big mango trees can be found. There was a continuous flow of water coming from Bucal to the Poblacion during the Spanish period which they call Simbro. However, due to the town's development, most lands are now being converted into subdivisions and other business establishments. On December 17, 1944, three persons living here were killed at the sona (zonification) in the Poblacion. They were Conrado Aledia, Primitivo Sango and Matiaga Ramirez. Today, the place is on development. The Dasmariñas Central Market and the business establishments such as the Walter Mart and FSC are located here.Three barangays are located in this district.

San Agustin I
San Agustin II
San Agustin III


=== San Jose ===
This barangay is situated between the Poblacion and Sabang. On April 13, 1889, a petition was passed appealing the sitio, once known Sitio Tamban, to be transformed into a barangay. The place was renamed on July 18, 1889, and was given the name San Jose in commemoration of their patron saint, St. Joseph. Cumpuerta is the name of the hide-out of the Filipino revolucionarios during the revolution against Spain. This is a deep canal of flowing water which still exists until now. The families of Cantada, Villena, Reyes, Mendoza, Camañag, Ramos, and Pastor are the first ones who settled here.Only one barangay is located in this district, its namesake, Barangay San Jose."


=== Salitran ===
This place is known for the name "Salitran" even during the Spanish period. There are no exact historical accounts for the origin of the name. Some says that such name was given because the early settlers of this place were from Pampanga, Visayas, Tagalog region and some Chinese that served the Spanish friars. However, according to the original settlers here, the place was originally called "Bayanan". They said that this has numerous big Spanish houses which is like in a small town. An old house in the eastern part of Salitran was used by the Spanish friars as the storage place for the rice and was called "Makina". It was also used as a headquarters by the Guardia Civil. When the revolution ignited, the "Makina" became the center of attack by the revolucionarios from the Poblacion and this barrio. The friars weren't aware of the said assault. On March 7, 1897, the Spanish went to Salitran where the Magdalo soldiers led by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo hid. General Emilio Aguinaldo received help from one thousand men and formed a greater force and even the Spanish troops led by General Lechambre didn't penetrate Salitran. Because of the rebelry, the Spanish burned all the houses and establishments in the barrio. There were only left three houses unburned. During the World War II, Simplicio Lara and Teodorico Timbang were killed by the Japanese soldiers. Now, Salitran is on vast development due to the presence of numerous subdivisions and villages. Schools located here are the St. Jude College, the Immaculate Conception Academy-North Campus, and many others. There are also many business establishments here.Four barangays are located in this district.

Salitran I
Salitran II
Salitran III
Salitran IV
Salitran V (proposed)


=== Sabang ===
On the northern part of Dasmariñas is where this barangay can be traveled and found. The word "Sabang" means "to overflow", wherein the creeks running from Malagasang, Imus tend to inundate in this place. This were made by the Spanish friars to irrigate the vast rice fields of the barangay. The diversion in the direction of the water flow had vastly made changes in the agriculture during the Spanish period, for there was a rich production of rice corps. Because of this, a bodega was made here for the storage of rice and was called the "Kamalig ng Pare" (Silo of the Priest). This place is considered to be the richest land in Dasmariñas. Residents here were known to be industrious. Agriculture is still a source of income in this barangay, though it has diminished due to the development of its agrarian lands into subdivisions and schools for children. More than 85% of the population are professionals and have a high standard of living. In this place, the Madona Charity Clinic is located, owned by Mrs. Bracia Tengko. This clinic provides aid and relief to the less fortunate residents seeking medical help. At the back of the Madona Clinic was a Rock with a Spring of Water (Bucal ng Tubig) at the Ylang-Ylang River. It was believed to have healing properties or miracles. In 2007 the Land Transportation Office Dasmarinas City or LTO Dasmarinas City District Office was established with the sponsorship and pioneering efforts of Mrs. Carmelita Carungcong Canete to better serve the ever-growing population of Dasmarinas City and its increasing pool of motor vehicles.
This Barangay is also the birthplace of a Caviteno robinhood folk hero Leonardo Manicio, also known as "Nardong Putik"
Only one barangay is located in this district, its namesake, Barangay Sabang.


=== Burol ===
On the eastern part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 kilometers away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, it is safe to say that it was formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes. The Japanese soldiers also planted several cotton trees on the area. Now, this place is considered one of the richest barangay in Dasmariñas. Many schools and colleges can be found here such as the Southern Luzon College, International English Center, Asian Trinity School, and many others. Adjacent to the place is the Emilio Aguinaldo College. Numerous subdivisions and villages are also located here.Four barangays are located in this district, these are:

Burol I
Burol II
Burol III
Burol Main


=== Langkaan ===
This place is located on the south-western part of Dasmariñas. The name "Langkaan" came from the word "langka" meaning jackfruit; which is believed to be planted in many parts of this barangay during the 1900, the year of its foundation. Barangay Langkaan was a part of a vast hacienda during the Spanich period that's why there are numerous water systems for ricefields that can be found here. The San Agustin Dam was constructed in 1855. On the last part of the 19th century, the Spaniards erected an indigo plantation here. The stone-made grinder of indigo still exists until now and it is the mark of the Spanish influence in the place. The Spaniards are the first ones who planted sugar canes and became the primary source of income during the 18th century. During those times, tarapiche and carabaos are used to make panucha and paldo. Don Placido Campos and Andres Medina are the ones who owned these tarapiche. When the Americans arrived, this place attracted residents from the Poblacion. The families Quillao, Bautista, Sarabusab, Reyes, Remulla, Sango, Laudato, Empeño, Satsatin, Medina, de Lima and others transferred here during those times. During the Second World War, the Japanese had a big plantation of cotton trees in Langkaan. Dasmarineños were forced to work here. A Japanese concentration camp was also established in this area. Now, this is considered to be a backbone of the economic progress of Dasmariñas. The presence of numerous factories in different industrial estates in this area, such as the First Cavite Industrial Estate, serves as the working place for the workers living in Dasmariñas and other towns of Cavite as well.Two barangays are located in this district, these are:

Langkaan I
Langkaan II


=== Paliparan ===
Paliparan is situated at the southeastern part of Dasmariñas. In the easternmost part, is surrounded by the municipalities of Gen. Mariano Alvarez, Cavite and San Pedro, Laguna. This place was a grassy land with no trees growing on its wide space providing an excellent place for flying kites during summer. In fact, this was what used to be – a paliparan – meaning an airfield for flying kites. During the Spanish period, the Spaniards used to go to this place during weekends to fly kites of different designs and colors. The first settlers here came from the town of Imus. Among them are the families of Faustino Alvarez, Flaviano Pakingan, Gregorio de la Cruz, Pablo Papa, Dominguez and the Martinez. In 1911, most of the residents here are said to be uneducated because there were only eight persons who can vote. Also during the Spanish period, this place became a hiding place for the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, some hide-outs of the guerillas were found here such as of "P.Q.O.G., R.C.T.C. Hunters, Reyes Regimen and Saulog Regimen". In June 1943, the Japanese ordered the residents to assemble in front of the school wherein they were not given food and water from morning until evening. Suspected guerrilla members were killed. This barangay is sub divided into six sitios which are Nyugan (on the west), Crossing, Paliparan (on the north), Paliparan Ilaya (also on the north), Pook and Burol (on the north-east). Today, it is considered to be one of the richest barangay in Dasmariñas because of the many factories and industrial estates that are located here. Among them are the Monterey, Reynold's Corporation, Molave Industrial Estate and many others.Three barangays are located in this district, these are:

Paliparan I
Paliparan II
Paliparan III


=== Salawag ===
Barangay Salawag is the largest barangay of the city in terms of land area and population. It is located in the north-eastern part of Dasmariñas. Such name was given to this place due to the presence of bamboo trees (salawag in archaic Tagalog) made for the construction of houses. This barangay had many names during the olden times. The Spanish called this "Pasong Tinta" because there were many plants called "tinta-tintahan" used as an ink. This was also called "Horong Bato" because the early settlers believed that there is a treasure here buried under a large rock. During the arrival of the Americans, the place was called "Mataas na Sampalok" because there were numerous tall sampaloc (tamarind) trees planted here. The first families to live here are the Macalinao, Pacifico, Purificacion and Paras; while the richest families living here are the Acuzar, Panerio and Muncada families. Only one barangay is located in this district, its namesake, Barangay Salawag.
Today, the barangay boasts of the world-class Orchard Golf and Country Club, the site of the 1995 Johnnie Walker Golf Tournament and a state university, the Technological University of the Philippines – Cavite Campus, established in 1979. Many subdivisions and villages are also located here, such as Golden City, San Marino City, Avida Santa Catalina Village, Avida Sta Cecilia and Avida Residences Dasmarinas. Commercial establishments include The District Dasmarinas, SM Savemore Salawag and SM Savemore San Marino.
Salawag is also unique among the barangays in the city as it has two Catholic churches serving its huge population. First established was Mary Immaculate Parish in NIA Road, built in 2003 under the pastoral care of the Sons of the Holy Mary Immaculate, which is also the home of Salawag's patroness: Maria Inmaculada de Salawag, whose image is reported to be miraculous and was Episcopally Crowned on December 8, 2018 by the Bishop of Imus, Most Rev. Reynaldo G. Evangelista. Second was Pope John XXIII Parish in San Marino City, established in 2016.
Two townships led by two of the country's largest real estate companies, Ayala Land's Vermosa and Vista Land's Vista City, both include areas under the jurisdiction of Barangay Salawag.

=== Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan ===

Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan (DBB) was established in 1975 under the government of Pres. Ferdinand Marcos. At first, it occupies 234 hectares of land in the town and is 8 kilometers away from the town's Poblacion. This land was bought by the PHHC or the People Homesite Housing Corporation to the owners at two million and four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000) which then became the resettlement area for the less-privileged families living in the depressed areas of Metro Manila. The families of Eduardo Coronel, Rogelio Tomas, Ruben Alvarez, Manuel Rabang, Aurora Dela Cruz and Diosdado Alto were the first ones to live here. Diosdado Alto, Rodolfo Urubia, Danilo Serrano, Maximo Esteban, Manuel Macuto and Francisco Gonzales became the first barangays leaders.
After a few years, DBB was divided into 30 barangays with a population of 100,000 living in more than 600 hectares of land. Each families were given 90–200 square meters which they loan from the NHA or the National Housing Authority. On September 12, 1990, the Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Council) passed Order 108-90 ordering DBB to be divided into 47 barangays which then was approved by the authority.
