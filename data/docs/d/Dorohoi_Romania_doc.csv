== History ==
Dorohoi used to be a market for the timber and farm produce of the north Moldavian highlands; merchants from the neighboring states flocked to its great fair, held on the June 12.  The settlement is first mentioned in documents from 1408, where a treaty was signed between Moldavian voievode, Alexandru cel Bun, and the King of Poland and Hungary.
Dorohoi was bombed by the Russians during World War I.Dorohoi used to be the capital of Dorohoi County, but was degraded to a municipality when Romania lost Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. On July 1, 1940, units of the Romanian Army attacked local Jews in a pogrom.  These military actions against the Jews were not endorsed by the Romanian Government.  When the conspiracy against the Jews was discovered by the military command, troops were sent to end the abuse.
