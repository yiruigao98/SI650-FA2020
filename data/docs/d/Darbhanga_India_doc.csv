The famine of 1874 gave a great impetus to the construction of railways, and the District is on the whole well off in the matter of communications. Its south-west corner is traversed for 29 miles by the main line of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, and also by 25 miles of the new chord-line from Hajipur to Bachwara, which runs parallel to the Ganges embankment from east to west. From Samastipur a line runs to Darbhanga town and there branches off in two directions, the first north-west to Sitamarhi through Kamtaul and Jogiara, and the other due east to Khanwa Ghat on the Kosi (Old streem) near Pratapganj. The total length of the line within the District is 146 miles. Most of the earthwork for a line from Sakri to Jaynagar on the Nepal frontier was completed as a relief work during the famine of 1897 ; and the line, which has now been opened, should tap a large grain supply from Nepal.
