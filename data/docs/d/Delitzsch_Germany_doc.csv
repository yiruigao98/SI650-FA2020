== History ==
Delitzsch was founded as a town around 1200 AD (according to chronicles) and became recognized as a city in 1300 AD.  Both before and after its founding, the city fought off many invaders: first the Slavic tribes who had lived there before the city was founded and then, later, in the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), the Swedes.  A legend arose from this final encounter with the Swedes, saying that when the Swedes reached the river Lober, the tower warden's daughter spied them and blew a trumpet, allowing the citizens of the town to get to safety and prepare, and as a result the invaders were defeated.  Every year there is a historical medieval style fair to celebrate this victory over the Swedes and, during the fair, shops are open on Sundays.
As a result of the Congress of Vienna in 1814-15, Delitzsch was granted to Prussia from the Kingdom of Saxony. A district of Delitzsch was established for administrative purposes.
In World War II (1939 - 1945), only one building, the station, was burned, minimal damage in comparison with many other German urban centers.
According to a 1996 census, Delitzsch had more than 27,000 inhabitants.
