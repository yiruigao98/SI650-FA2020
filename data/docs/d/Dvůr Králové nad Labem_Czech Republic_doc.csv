Dvůr Králové nad Labem (Czech pronunciation: [ˈdvuːr ˈkraːlovɛː ˈnad labɛm], German: Königinhof an der Elbe) is a town in Trutnov District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 16,000 inhabitants. It lies in the Elbe river valley. It is located in the Eastern Bohemia close to the Czech highest mountains Krkonoše.


== History ==
Dvůr Králové was first mentioned in 1270. It was a dowry town, owned by the King's wife and responsible for her expenses when her husband died.
Until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the Königshof an der Elbe – Dvůr Králové nad Labem District, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.


=== Textile industry ===
Dvůr Králové allowed Jews to settle there in 1848. Various Jewish families arrived in the early 1860s and began developing a local textile industry (the soft water of the Elbe was essential for the dying and printing for the textile industry). By 1930 there were some 200 to 300 Jews living in the town. The textile industry had grown to some 17 textile firms (Sohorts, Neuman, Mautner, Deutsch etc.) By the end of 1945 there were no Jews left in the town.


=== Manuscript affair ===
On 16 September 1817 Václav Hanka allegedly discovered a manuscript appearing to be from the 13th century in the tower of a local church. The Manuscript of Dvůr Kralové, probably in fact created by Hanka, was intended to help Czech patriots in the struggle against German culture. It was proven to be a forgery at the end of the 19th century by Professor Tomáš Masaryk and confirmed as such by later examinations. A minority of historians still consider it genuine.


== Economy ==
Dvůr Králové nad Labem is a centre of the textile and machinery industries.
