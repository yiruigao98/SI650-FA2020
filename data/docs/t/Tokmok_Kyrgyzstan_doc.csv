Despite its relatively modern origin, Tokmok stands in the middle of the Chuy Valley, which was a prize sought by many medieval conquerors. The ruins of Ak-Beshim, the capital of the Western Turkic Khaganate, are situated 8 km southwest from Tokmok.  Yusuf Has Hajib Balasaguni, author of the Kutadgu Bilig is said to have been born in this area.
About 15 km south of Tokmok is the 11th-century Burana Tower, located on the grounds of an ancient citadel of which today only a large earthen mound remains.  This is believed to be the site of the ancient city of Balasagun, founded by the Sogdians and later for some time the capital of the Kara-Khanid empire.  A large collection of ancient gravestones and bal-bals is nearby.  Excavated Scythian artifacts have been moved to museums in St. Petersburg and Bishkek.
