== History ==
Taytay was a settlement situated along the coastline of the eastern side of Laguna de Bay that formed part of the Kingdom of Namayan, also known as the Kingdom of "Sapa", which was ruled by Lakan Tagkan. The said territory is what we know now as the district of Santa Ana, Manila.
Upon the arrival of the Franciscan missionaries on July 2, 1578 in Manila, they proceeded to evangelize the inhabitants of Namayan and organized it into a pueblo and named it Visita Santa Ana de Sapa. It comprised the communities of Meycatmon, Calatongdongan, Dongos, Dibag, Pinacauasan, Yamagtogon, Meysapan (Pasay), Malate, Dilao (Paco), Pandacan, Quiapo, Sampaloc, San Miguel, San Juan del Monte, San Felipe Neri (Mandaluyong), San Pedro Macati, and Taytay.Thence, the district of Santa Ana de Sapa became the Franciscan's central mission station.
In 1579, Taytay was formally established as a town and Church in a symbiotic relation, i.e., it presupposes that one could not have existed without the other. A church was built out of light materials and called it “Visita de Santa Ana de Sapa”. Taytay—now a larger village, a pueblo, a town—came into being, as a juridical entity as well as an actual territorial unit.
Saint John the Baptist has since been the patron of the town and the parish under the ministry of the Franciscans.
The ecclesial jurisdiction of Taytay, including the visita of Cainta, which was an annex of Taytay, were transferred to the newly arrived Jesuit missionaries in 1591. They served until 1768—for 177 years.Fray Pedro Chirino, a distinguished historian, became the first Jesuit parish priest of Taytay. He celebrated his first Holy Mass as a missionary in the swampy resettlement area on March 25, 1591, the feast of the Annunciation.Due to incessant flood, the town was relocated to a higher ground. The people followed suit after the church was rebuilt atop a hill. Taytay town was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and christened “San Juan del Monte” [which means “Saint John of the Mountain”]. “San Juan” got the “del Monte” tag in reference to the hilly terrain of the new relocation site of the town.
Nevertheless, the townspeople continued to call their town Taytay, and Taytay it has remained to this day.This is the same location where the present St John the Baptist Parish Church still stands.Encomienda in Taytay
Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi enforced the encomienda system into the Philippine Islands since his arrival in 1565. Taytay encomienda alone had 500 natives in 1582. There were about 400 households in Taytay, while only 100 households in Antipolo in 1591 [both encomiendas had already been granted to Juan Pacheco de Maldonado]; and in that same year, Taytay encomienda also listed 600 tributantes and inhabitants of 2,400 to 3,000.The kinds of encomienda were those of the Royal Crown (encomienda de la real corona), and those of the private persons (encomienda de perticulares).  In 1591, the encomienda of Taytay which was included in the vast district of Santa Ana de Sapa, belonged to the Royal Crown.The lakeshore town of Taguig on the West was at the opposite side of Taytay on the East of Laguna de Bay. They were both encomiendas under the scope of Santa Ana de Sapa. They were separated by a narrow tip portion of Pasig town. Adjacent to Pasig was the area situated on the lakeshore of Barangay Santa Ana of Taytay. It was a tract of agricultural land considered as a “friar estate” which is still known today as “Lupang Arenda” which has now become a relocation and resettlement site.
“Arenda” is a lease of fixed assets or of prerogatives, such as land, or of special rights engaging in agriculture, mining, the collection of duties and taxes. “Arenda” rights are directly associated with the encomienda.
According to former Taytay Mayor Felix M. Sanvictores (1925-1931), “Lupang Arenda was donated by Don Juan Valerio Gonzales and Don Cristobal Paramdam to the Municipio in 1740. Aside from their own farmlands, Taytay farmers were also benefiting from farming in the “arenda” as well as fishing in the wide rivers flowing down the lake and in the vast flooded farmlands near the lake during the rainy season.”In February 23, 1853, a decree of the Superior Government created a district composed of the towns of Taytay, Antipolo, Bosoboso, and Cainta [from the Province of Tondo], and the towns of Morong, Baras, Tanay, Pililla, Angono, Binangonan, Cardona, and Jalajala [from the Province of La Laguna], with Morong as its capital town. It was later called Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong.
The coming of Americans
Taytay suffered heavy casualties during the Philippine–American War in 1899, with the church almost burned down and most of the town razed to the ground.On June 11, 1901, Taytay became part of the newly created Province of Rizal by virtue of an Act No. 137 enacted by the First Philippine Commission. In 1903, Taytay was merged with the neighboring towns of Cainta and Angono by virtue of Act No. 942. That did not last long as Angono was separated to be merged with Binangonan later that year and Cainta became an independent town again in 1914.During the Second World War, Taytay was occupied by Japanese forces in 1942. Local soldiers of the pre-war 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated and entered Taytay in 1945 to help the recognized guerrilla fighter units to defeat and attack the Japanese Imperial Army. On November 7, 1975, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824, which created the Metro Manila Area, Taytay was among the towns that remained within the Province of Rizal.


=== Campaign for Cityhood ===
Taytay has its growth of population and income, which qualifies for cityhood. Like its neighbor Cainta, it did not fully qualified to be a city due to boundary disputes. Its cityhood bid was supported by the League of Cities of the Philippines and then-governor of Rizal, Casimiro Ynares III. It was currently set aside for the meantime, citing that there are priorities that needed to be attended to before cityhood.


=== National Competitiveness ===
The National Competitiveness Council has named Taytay as the "2nd Most Competitive Municipality (1st & 2nd Class) since 2016 until 2017", up from 10th place in 2014 and 3rd place in 2015.

The municipality is principally drained by south-west trending rivers such as Taytay River, Panghulo River, and Napindan Channel, all of which empties into Laguna Lake. Taytay River flows across Barangays Dolores and San Isidro and joins Antipolo River (present course of Manggahan Floodway) as it passes through the southern end of Barangays Santa Ana and San Juan. Panghulo River snakes its way from upper Taytay across Barangay San Juan towards the southern portion of Barangay Muzon. Napindan Channel crosses the southern boundaries of Barangay Santa Ana and San Juan as it empties into Laguna Lake. Bangiad Creek, found at the south-eastern limits of the municipality, flows south-west ward across Barangay Muzon, extending toward Laguna Lake.
