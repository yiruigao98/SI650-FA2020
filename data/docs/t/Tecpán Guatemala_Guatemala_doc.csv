== History ==

Tecpán is known as the 'first capital of Guatemala,' based on it being the first permanent Spanish colonial military center of the nation, established in 1525. The first government capital settlement in colonial Guatemala, and its 'second capital', was Ciudad Vieja, established in 1527. 
The fort was built here due to the difficulty that the Spanish had in defeating the Kaqchikel Maya during the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. 
The remains of the Kaqchikel capital city, Iximché, are on a high hill only a few kilometers away from the city .
