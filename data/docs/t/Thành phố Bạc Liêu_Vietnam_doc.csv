Bạc Liêu (Vietnamese: [ɓàːk liəw] (listen)) is a provincial city and capital of the Bạc Liêu Province in the Mekong Delta region in southern Vietnam. It is a medium-sized town with a population of approximately 150,000. The former name of the city is Vĩnh Lợi.


== History ==
The name Bạc Liêu is based on the Chinese pronunciation of a Khmer name  (Pol Leav ពលលាវ in Khmer). In the 1950s the area was a centre of Huỳnh Phú Sổ's Hòa Hảo religion after Sổ was released there.
