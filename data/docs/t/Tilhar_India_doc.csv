== History ==
Tilhar was named after Trilok Chandra—a Kayastha who came from Pakhna Vihar, situated near Farrukhabad—either just before or during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. The present-day city Shahjahanpur was established by Diler Khan and Bahadur Khan who were commanders in the army of Mughal Emperor Jahangeer. Both of them were dignitaries in the regime of Shahjahan. Satisfied with the services of Diler Khan, Shahjahan gave him 14 villages and permission to build a fort. Diler Khan established a fort in Naina Khera, a village situated between the Garra and Khannaut rivers.Trilok Chandra had also built a fort earlier in Tilhar. The ruins of this fort can be seen in Dataganj Mohalla (Budaun). There were three large gates in the fort, two of which still exist. The village of Tilokpur (also named after Trilok Chandra) is located 7 kilometers south of Tilhar. Another fort, named Dodrajpur, was built by Raja Dudhraj.
