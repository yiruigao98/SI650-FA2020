== History ==

During the first millennium, Täby was part of the lands of the Svear, known as Svitjod. Remains from this period can be found in more than 37 runestones found in the municipality. In the north of the municipality can be found, the remains of the 11th-century causeway known as Jarlabankes bro. The cross on Täby's coat of arms is found on the Risbylestenen, a runestone, in the northern part of the municipality. It is said that this runestone shows the first signs of Christianity reaching this part of Europe. During the Middle Ages, Täby was part of the Attundaland region.
Täby remained a rural community until the 19th century. Most of the land was owned by the noble families. During the 16th and 17th centuries, most of the land in eastern Täby was owned by the Brahe family of Rydboholm Manor (Rydboholms slott). Other noble families owning land in Täby at different times during this period were Banér, Bååth, Roos, Sparre, Gyllenstierna and Meijerfeldt.
The latter two owned, at different times, Näsby Manor (Näsby Slott) in the southeast of the municipality. By 1790 Täby had a population of approximately 900 people, most of them living on one of the 36 farms. By the end of the 19th century the population had grown to approximately 1,250.
In 1885, the Roslagsbanan narrow-gauge railway was built, connecting Täby with the city of Stockholm. Täby experienced a population expansion. People settled near the railway stations. In 1902 the wealthy engineer Carl Robert Lamm (1856–1938), acquired the burned down Näsby Manor and rebuilt it.Around the time of the First World War many city dwellers in Stockholm acquired small summer residences in the eastern part of Täby, what is now the district of Näsbypark. By 1919 Täby's population had grown to 3,000. Some years after Second World War Täby increasingly became a suburb of Stockholm, and by 1947 the population had increased to 8,584, concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of the municipality.
In 1948 Täby acquired the title of a "merchant town" (Swedish: köping), valid until the reform of 1971. This was also the beginning of the large scale development of Täby, led by the mayor Gustaf Berg. By 1975 the population had increased to 41,307 people.Today, Täby is considered an attractive suburb to Stockholm with one of the highest median incomes in Sweden.


== Politics ==
Täby has for a long period of time been run by a coalition of centre-right parties. Filippa Reinfeldt, ex-wife of Fredrik Reinfeldt (the former Swedish Prime Minister and former leader of the Moderate Party), had been mayor of Täby for a long time, until Jan Rosenberg, of the Moderate Party, became the current mayor of Täby Municipality.
The slogan of the municipality is today in translation "Täby, the city on the countryside".


== Sights ==
Runestones: There are 37 identified runestones in Täby. Their inscriptions have provided many interesting and useful insights into the life and destinies of the people of the Viking Age. Judging from the inscriptions of the runestones and legends, the most important man at that time was Jarlabanke Ingefastsson (ca. 1000). He has given name to the remains of the Viking era causeway known as Jarlabankes bro.
Näsby Manor: Originally built in the 1660s and designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, Näsby Manor is located in the picturesque and natural setting of Näsbyviken shore. The manor was burned to the ground in 1897, but was rebuilt according to the original design on the initiative of Carl Robert and Dora Lamm who moved into the manor in 1905. Parts of the old manor garden still exist and are being well preserved.
Taby Racecourse: Sweden's largest horse racing track, inaugurated in 1960.
Täby Church: Built in the 13th century. It houses a triptych from the 15th century. The most notable objects are the wall paintings from the medieval times, painted by Albertus Pictor.
