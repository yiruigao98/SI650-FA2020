Taleigão is a town in Ilhas, Goa, near the capital city Panjim.


== Description ==
Taleigão is a developed village in Ilhas de Goa bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, vast tracts of fields to the east, Odxel-Vaiguinim-Dona Paula to the south and Santa Inez-Bhatlem to the north. Located just five kilometres from Panjim, Taleigão was the granary of the north Goa during the Portuguese era, as vast tracts of agricultural land were under rice cultivation. The essence of Taleigão lies in its marvellous expanses of palm – fringed beaches, the bright green paddy fields and Nagalli hill, antique houses and mansions, broad roads, footpaths, antique church, traffic circles with azulejo titles, chapels and temples, educational institutions, hotels and of course its friendly and fun loving inhabitants. The population is mixed with lot of settlers from other parts of Goa and outside Goa, especially on the Dona Paula Plateau and elsewhere. The original inhabitants are Gawda tribes who were (and still some of their descendants) involved in cultivation of the Comunidade land.
Taleigoa Panchayat was functioning since Portuguese time. First Sarpanch of Taleigoa village after liberation of Goa was  Freedom fighter Late Shri Narayan Naik in 1966


== Religious institutions ==


=== Church of São Miguel Arcanjo ===
The Igreja de São Miguel Arcanjo (Church of St Michael the Archangel) is one of the oldest churches in Goa, and was built by the Dominicans in 1544. It is also the only church in the town, serving one of the largest parishes in Goa. From the census conducted in 2015 there are about 12,000 catholic population. The Chapel of Blessed Sacrament was annexed in 2006 during the tenure of Fr. Carmo Martins. The assistant parish priest is Fr. Xavier Braganza and parish priest is Fr. Conceiçao D’Silva, who took charge of the church in June 2011,and took the initiatives to give a facelift to the church and renovate the parochial house and church office. The compound wall fitted with azulejo tiles bordering the Adro da Igreja de São Miguel and the illumination around it were added by Atanasio (Babush) Monserrate. The Taleigão parish celebrates two main feasts: the harvest feast on 21 August, and the feast of the patron - St. Minguel - on the nearest Sunday on or after 29 September.
The president of the feast of St Michael is selected from amongst the senior (those who have crossed 60 years) gaunkars of Comunidade de Taleigão. The selection is done a Sunday before the feast day by a democratic process where the names of the eligible gaunkars along with beads are put in a circular box with three compartments. Every gauncar who participated in the election inserts beads in the box through a small hole in the center. The lid of the box is rotated to ensure that the beads falls in the compartments at random. The gaunkar who scores the highest number of beads is elected to be the president for the forthcoming year. On the feast day, before the final blessing, the copper hat of St. Michael is placed on the head of the president-elect and a short prayer is recited for his good health. The Comunidade de Taleigão makes a provision for the expenses of the feast, novenas and vespers. In addition, the parishioners celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Rosary and Perpetua Succor.
The frontispiece of the church has a Holy Spirit in high relief. The Church has six altars, including the main altar. The main altar has the statue of St Michael above and to the right that of St Sebastian and to the left of St Anthony. The collateral altars: on the left is the altar of Our Lady of Rosary with a small statue of Saint Ana in a niche on top. To the right is the altar of Jesus Crucified and the statue of Saint Rita of Cassia. Another two altars have been added: one to the left has a panel and to the right is that of Our Lady with Infant Jesus with a book in his hand and a smaller statue at the bottom with Jesus. And closer to the entrance, to the right is the altar dedicated to Sacred Heart of Jesus with Sacred Heart of Mary and Saint Joseph Vaz on the sides. Statue of St Mother Teresa was added in 2016.
The corridor of the Church has interesting big panels along the wall, on the left side, which depicts the portraits of: Saint John the Baptist, Saint Roque and Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Peter, Saint Carlo Barromeo. On the right hand side is another painting of Jesus on the Cross at Mount Calvary, with Mother Mary, Mary Magdalena and others. In the wall, there is a niche, with Our Lady holding the Infant Jesus. On the right hand side, there are pedestals on which are kept five statues. That of Saint Dominic de Guzman, three different depiction, with a star on the forehead, in prayer and with the Bible in hand and Saint Thomas Aquinas, two different depiction, one with a sun on his chest and the other holding the Blessed Sacrament. Let us see the description of the Church of Taleigão as given by Ricardo Micael Teles in ‘A Voz de S. Francisco Xavier’, in 1941.
The main altar does not have a retable, which some 60 to 70 years back, was substituted by the throne of Exposition of the Sacrament. In this retable there were 6 big images of Dominican saints; five of which are in the corridor of the church. These were even taken to the fourth centenary celebrations of the canonical erection of the Archdiocese of Goa. The image of the patron saint St Michael Archangel is venerated in the niche where the Holy Sacrament is exposed. On this occasion the statue of St Michael is turned so that the rays on his back are used to expose the monstrance (custodia). On the sides of the wall are the images St Anthony and St Sebastian. The collateral altars are dedicated to Our Lady of Rosary and to Jesus Crucified with our Lady. The first, has on top, the image of St Anna with her daughter in her lap with a globe in her hand and the second the image of St Rita de Cassia, (Augustinian). These images must have been put up after those of the Dominicans were removed. Of late the altar of Sacrad Heart of Jesus was established. There is also an altar dedicated to the Holy Souls. According to Teles there were three Confraternities, namely Our Lady of Rosary, Our Lady of Loreto and that of Holy Souls. Francisco Xavier Gomes Catão mentions in the Anuário da Arquidiocese de Goa e Damão (1953), that there are seven altars in the Church. In 1972 the Church underwent restoration work which was funded by Mr. Arthur Ligorio Benedicto Anunciaçao Viegas, who at the time spent rupees 60,000 and the Pope Paul VI honoured him with ‘Medalha de Proeclesia Pontificie’.
There are plans to built a modern St Michael Parish community center consisting of gathering hall, a clinic for elderly, a library, class rooms for catechism children and a meeting room for youth.


=== Chapels in Taleigão ===
Taleigão also has at least twelve chapels and a number of road-side crosses some of which have been sheltered in the recent past. The oldest chapel was built by Franciscans in 1541 at Cabo. It is dedicated to Nossa Senhora Mãe de Deus. It houses some exquisite artefacts including a 17th-century portrait of the infant Jesus made of ivory. St. Pedro Copel, also known as Ruzai Saibinichem Copel (Nossa Senhora do Rosário) at Caranzalem was built in the year 1731 by Cónego Francisco da Cunha Souto Maior. St. Francis Xavier's Chapel at Kerant originally known as Copela de San Francisco Xavier de Taleigão was built in 1928. It was blessed on 10 October 1930 by the then Bishop of Cochin and Administrator Apostolate, and the first mass was celebrated on 12 October 1930. It was enlarged in 1935 and renovated in 2002. Just 100 meters from this chapel is Nossa Senhora da Piedade which was constructed in November 1846 in Eugenio ward. Another oldest chapel at Odxel dedicated to Nossa Senhora de Lourdes was constructed by Querobino Martins de Taleigão in November 1891. The chapel of Nossa Senhora do Perpétuo Socorro at Dona Paula was built in September 1935.

Amongst the others, the most unusual ones is Shri. Mahalaxmi Devasthan at Oitalem. Both these temples have a Cross inside the temple and candles are lit every night by our Hindu Brethren and Litanies are held occasionally with the help of the catholic community.


=== Mosques ===
Taleigão has a mixed population of slightly over 17,000. The Catholics population is more than 12,000 followed closely by Hindus  and Muslims. There are two Masjids in this village one at Vodlem Bhat and other at Adarsh. The unique feature of this village is that the people of different faiths live in communal harmony.


== Feasts ==


=== Konsanche fest of Taleigão (Harvest feast) ===
In the entire Ilhas de Goa, the Taleigão village was officially accorded the privilege by the then Portuguese Governor Afonso de Albuquerque to cut the first sheaves of corn and present it to the benevolent Creator on 21 August. Traditionally, the harvest feast is celebrated with enthralling music of brass bands, colourful ceremonial umbrella, cannon fire, procession and high mass at São Miguel Arcanjo church. This thanks giving ceremony commemorates the Festa da Espiga or Novidade– a time for rejoicing and worship for the cultivators, as a gratitude to the Almighty for the bountiful crop he has gracefully bestowed.


==== History of the Novidade ====
The Novidade has a history of nearly 500 years dating back to the arrival of Portuguese in India in 1510. The King of Portugal Dom Manuel-I wanted Portugal to become a major player in maritime trade with Asian countries by establishing sea ports (feitorias) for trading spices. The King deputed Admiral Alfonso de Albuquerque to conquer Hormuz, Aden and Malacca. However, Alfonso de Albuquerque received an invitation from an exiled Hindu admiral from Goa, Thimayya- an admiral of the Honavar  who had received appeals from Hindu population in Goa to relieve them from Muslim rule. Goa was a great and prosperous trading port on the Indian coast which was ruled by Sultan Ismail Adil Shah of Bijapur under the Ottoman Empire of Persia. Alfonso de Albuquerque seized this opportunity and reached Goa in February 1510 with a powerful fleet of twenty three ships and 1200 soldiers. The assault on the Muslim troops took place from 4 March to 20 May 1510, but the Portuguese were temporally defeated. With the monsoon setting in, the warfare logistics became difficult due to high waves in the Aguada Bay. The Portuguese fleet could not leave the Mandovi river as the exit route was blocked by the sand bar formed at the entrance of Aguada Bay. So the troops got stranded and were forced to take shelter on the rafters at the edge of the Mandovi river at Britona. It was a thick forest area with no inhabitants in those days. As days went by the troops ran out of provisions and had to survive on rats. The fishermen from Taleigão who ventured into the river learnt the plight of the Portuguese troops and they informed the people of Taleigão. The Taleigão gauncars (influential inhabitants who had the control over the agricultural land) who cultivated fields and had stock of food grains took the initiative of supplying provisions to the troops at the dead of the night by risking their lives from the Muslim troops and inclement weather. They would load the provisions on bullock carts and transport them towards Aivão (a small fishing hamlet at Caranzalem), where the fishermen used to anchor their canoes. After unloading the same in the canoes they would row the canoe with the aid of an oil lamp towards Britona at the dead of the night. In those days, Panjim (Paigim), which was a ward of Taleigão, was originally a small fishing village with lots of coconut groves between creeks and fields. The only structure in Panjim was Adil Shah's summer palace which was surrounded by a moat. After three months of waiting, Alfonso de Albuquerque was joined by more reinforcements accompanied by Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos from Malacca. After fighting for less than a day, they captured Ilhas from the Muslims on 10 December 1510.
In 1514, Alfonso de Albuquerque devoted himself to governing Goa. He gradually elevated Goa to a political and commercial capital of Portuguese India. He established coin minting. In the memory of the conquest of Ilhas, Alfonso de Albuquerque build a chapel dedicated to St. Catherine at Old Goa which was enlarged into a big church which is now known as Sé Cathedral. In recognition to the help rendered by the people of Taleigão, by offering food provisions to his troops, Alfonso de Albuquerque granted them the privilege to cut the first sheaves of corn on 21 August, prior to other villages in Ilhas. The decree has been described in the Foral of Portuguese writer Afonso Mexia dated 16 September 1526, Article 54 which says: "The village of Taleigão has prominence over the others to harvest the paddy. The gaonkars will come every year with sheaves of paddy stalks to the city of Goa (now old Goa), where it will be presented at the main altar at the Se Cathedral. From there, the Vicar will come with them to the Fort where the Factor will present a pachari (a white or coloured shawl), on which he is allowed to spend four pardaos (currency of the time). To the gaonkar who has been selected amongst them for this honour. Thereafter, the harvesting in other villages can be effected."
Alfonso de Albuquerque strengthened the foundation of the existing agricultural association and named it as a Comunidade. He introduced rules and regulation (Código de Comunidades) which empowered them with administrative, financial and judicial powers. He took the initiative in appointing managing committees of Gauncars to administer and monitor the distribution of agricultural land (aforamento & shares) and collection of revenue from the agricultural produce, which was used for the welfare of village community and paying dividends (zonos). As a result of these reforms and transparency in the system, the Comunidade of Taleigão prospered economically from the rice cultivation on vast tracts of land and earned the distinction of being the granary of Ilhas de Goa. As a tradition, on 24 August the President of the feast and the representatives of gauncars present the first sheaves of corn to the Governor who is the custodian of Comunidade land. As a part of the Hindu culture, the then Gauncars who were Hindus offered the first fruits of nature to god and sought blessings from the village deity. After embracing Christianity, the Gauncars continued these traditions with Eucharistic celebration in church and worshiped the patron of the village- São Miguel Arcanjo. This explains why the Comunidade Gauncars have the privilege of celebrating the Festa da Espiga and the feast of patron São Miguel Arcanjo. The Gauncars maintained the church (painting, repairs, bell tower, etc.) and village roads, bunds, etc., using the funds of the Comunidade.


==== Traditions of the Novidade ====
Taleigão is the only village in Goa where the Novidade is celebrated traditionally for 4 days (21–24 August). The feast is celebrated in rotation among the Gauncar families in the following order: Mendonça, Viegas, Martins, Luis, Gomes, Faria, Almeida, Falcão, and Abreu.
21 August: Cannons (fosné) are fired at noon and during the pealing of the Angelus bell on the previous day to convey to the neighbouring villages that Taleigão is all set to celebrate the Novidade. On 21 August, the Alvarado de Música played at dawn in the village lanes heralds the celebration and sets the village folk into festive mood. At 8:30 am, President of the feast marches under the cover of a colourful ceremonial umbrella to the São Miguel Arcanjo church to the beats of brass band. From the church the parishioners proceed in a procession to the field at Tolliant earmarked by the Comunidade for cutting of the sheaves. In 90's the procession used to be led by dhol caxia (drum)and a trumpet, followed by Adao representing the village tribes dressed in colourful costumes and dancing with bamboo sticks and swords. They are followed by flag of holy trinity (previously it was Portuguese flag)and the parishioners, the Confrades carrying the statue of the patron São Miguel Arcanjo on Charol, the feast President, the Parish priest, and the brass band playing religious tunes. The procession proceeds along the Estrada de Santos Passos which joins to Rua de Novidade. This 1 km long route is traditionally decorated with 24 arches of bamboo shoots. After a short prayer, the Parish priest blesses the sheaves by sprinkling holy water and burning incense. Then the feast President cuts the sheaves with a silver sickle and carries them in a silver tray to the church. While returning to the church, prayers and sheaves are also offered at the São Miguel Arcanjo chapel en route. High mass is celebrated at the church at 10:00 am. After the mass, the parishioners participate in the Quermés (games) organised by the parish youth, with the background music of brass band. In the afternoon, coconut breaking competitions are held at every nook and corner of the village and the football finals of Säo Miguel trophy is organised at Dr. Alvaro Remigio Pinto ground by the Clube de Säo Miguel de Taleigão. In tune with Goan cultural traditions, the day ends with a Tiatr in the late evening.
22 August: With the boom of cannons in the background and accompanied by the traditional band, the feast President sets out to distribute fov (beaten rice) to nine Gauncar families living in different wards of the village. In tune with the Christian teachings, this act of distributing beaten rice represents sharing of joy and happiness of the rich harvest.
23 August: At 4:00 pm, the President of the feast accompanied by traditional band and the boom of canons proceeds to the church and offers fov at the altar of São Miguel Arcanjo. After prayers by the Parish priest, fov are presented to him at the parochial house. This act shows the Act of sharing of joy with the Parish Priest.
24 August: The male representatives of the nine Gauncar families and three members of the Comunidade managing committee carry the blessed sheaves, fov, and flower bouquet to Sé Cathedral, Old Goa, which was the capital of Goa until the 18th century and the Sé Cathedral was the main church. The group is received at the church entrance by the Parish Priest of Sé Cathedral with the pealing of the golden bell and playing of the traditional band in the background. A special mass is celebrated on the occasion which is also attended by devotees residing around Old Goa. The blessed sheaves are then distributed by the priest during the mass. After the mass, fov are also distributed by the President of the feast to the congregation and the resident priests. Later, the group presents fov and sheaves to the Archbishop at Paço Patriarcal and to the Governor of Goa at Raj Bhavan. At Raj Bhavan, the feast President reads out a short speech highlighting the various difficulties faced by villagers in cultivating the fields, drainage system, etc. In the afternoon the group is treated to a sumptuous lunch consisting of twelve dishes at the feast President's residence, with a boom of cannons in the background. It is customary to play a game of cards for entertainment.
The traditions of Novidade revive the bond of friendship between the families under the tutelage of the Comunidade de Taleigão and blessings of the patron São Miguel Arcanjo.

== Occupation of Taleigãokars ==
Traditionally, agriculture and horticulture was the main occupation of the villagers. Taleigão is blessed with vast tracts of land where rice is used to be cultivated during monsoon and vegetables were grown in summer. The flat portion on the hill tops were utilised to grow lady fingers, raggi, snake gourd, ridge gourd, etc., in monsoon season. Taleigão's tambdi bhaji, sweet potatoes, brinjals, chillies, bottle gourd, etc., are famous for their taste all over Tiswadi taluka. Since the last decade, farming is on decline because of high labour costs, flooding of the fields in monsoon due to non-maintenance of water channels, youth taking up different jobs, migration of families to other countries, etc. Concrete structures have taken over the agricultural land in Taleigão which has transformed the village into an urban settlement. The Progressive Farmer's Club of Taleigão has taken initiatives to revive agriculture by availing government schemes. The influx of migrants have had a tremendous impact on the culture and traditions of the villagers.


== Sports ==
Like any other Goan village, Taleigão's most famous sport is football. Clube Sao Miguel de Taleigao, a football club based in Taleigão, represents them in Goa's top-tier league, the Goa Professional League.
