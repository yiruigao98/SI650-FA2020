== History ==
Tanauan (lookout point) was founded by the Augustinians in 1584 on the northwestern bay of Lake Taal, called Tanauan Bay.  Lookout towers were associated with 16th and 17th century churches to forewarn of Moro raids.  "Old Tanauan" (Lumang Tanauan) included such a watch tower and associated sapao (built-up structures in the water).  The 1754 eruption of Taal Volcano forced the town inhabitants to move initially to Sala.  Then both towns moved again later that year to Tanauan's current location, in which Sala is now a barrio.Tanaueños have displayed characteristics of personal independence and nationalism since early history. The town is called the cradle of noble heroes due to its contribution to the revolutionary movement of its sons Apolinario Mabini, the brains of Katipunan, and later by the statesman Jose P. Laurel. Also, three Tanaueños served as governors of Batangas, namely: Jose P. Laurel V, Modesto Castillo and Nicolas Gonzales.Recent events include the assassination of its former mayor, Cesar V. Platon, by NPA rebels on 7 May 2001, as he was running for the governorship of Batangas.  This happened a few days before the election. On 2 July 2018, then-incumbent mayor Antonio Halili, noted for public humiliation campaigns against criminals and drug pushers, was assassinated during the flag raising ceremony at the city hall.

According to cityhood advocates, quoted in reports reaching Batangas on Sunday, the turnout, despite being two times better than previous conversion-to-city exercises, was still only 16%.It suggested that 84% of Tanaueños were in any of the following states regarding cityhood:
They were not aware of what was going on.
