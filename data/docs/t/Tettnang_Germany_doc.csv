Tettnang is a town in the Bodensee district in southern Baden-Württemberg in a region of Germany known as Swabia.
It lies 7 kilometres from Lake Constance. The region produces significant quantities of Tettnang hop, an ingredient of beer, and ships them to breweries throughout the world.


== History ==
Tettinang or Tettinac was first mentioned in 882 in a document of the Abbey of St. Gall. In the beginning of the 10th century the castle of the Counts of Montfort was built near the town. The town privileges were granted in 1294 by King Adolf of Nassau. The reign of the Counts of Montfort ended 1780 when they sold the county to Austria, along with Tettnang Castle to pay debts. The county became part of Further Austria under the house of Habsburg. In the Peace of Pressburg of 1805 it became Bavarian property which gave it to Württemberg five years later. With the merge of Baden, Hohenzollern and Württemberg in 1952 it became part of the new formed state Baden-Württemberg. Until 1973 it was capital of the district Tettnang which was merged with parts of district of Überlingen to form the Bodenseekreis.

== Trivia ==
The second release of the Linux operating system Fedora was named "Tettnang" because of the hops grown in Tettnang being used for making beer. The release was preceded by the beer-related name "Yarrow" (an early substitute for hops) and followed by "Heidelberg" (a German city and the name of a distributor of beer).The anti-virus software vendor Avira, a company with around 100 million customers and 500 employees all over the world has its headquarters in Tettnang. Based near Lake Constance, the security specialist is one of the biggest regional entrepreneurs.
