== Transportation ==


=== Railways ===
West Japan Railway Company
JR Kyoto Line: Settsu-Tonda Station – Takatsuki Station
Hankyu Railway
Kyoto Line: Tonda Station – Takatsuki-shi Station – Kammaki StationTakatsuki-shi is serviced by two train lines: JR (Japan Railway Company) and Hankyu. Many people prefer to ride on the JR line, due to the JR's cheaper fares and slightly more frequent service. When the JR Fukuchiyama Line crashed and caused 108 casualties in 2005, the number of people using JR dropped compared to Hankyu but has recovered since. Takatsuki is one of the larger suburban cities outlying central Osaka, so almost every train stops at this station.
The Sakaisuji Line terminates at the Takatsuki-shi Station, while it sometimes comes from the Kawaramachi Station.
