Tabuk (Arabic: تَبُوْك‎ Tabūk), also spelled Tabouk, is the capital city of the Tabuk Region in northwestern Saudi Arabia. It has a population of 551,124 (2017 census). It is close to the Jordanian–Saudi Arabia border, and houses the largest air force base in Saudi Arabia.


== History ==
Ptolemy mentioned a place by the name 'Tabawa', at the northwestern corner of Arabia. This name may be a reference to 'Tabuka' or 'Tabuk'. If this is true, the town may be as old as Ptolemy's time. Pre-Islamic Arab poets, such as Antra and Nabiqa, mentioned its mountain 'Hasmi' in their poems.
Tabouk became famous for the Expedition to Tabuk in 8 AH (630 CE), during the period of prophet Muhammad. Since then, it remained a gateway of North Arabia. It was also visited by a number of European travelers such as Doughty in 1294 AH (1877 CE) and Huber in 1303 AH (1884 CE).
Tabuk became a centre of military activity during the 1991 Gulf War as the city faced threats from Iraqi scuds and air attacks.
