The temple of Toyokawa Inari, a popular pilgrimage destination, dates from 1441. A number of daimyō clans under the Tokugawa shogunate originate in what are now parts of Toyokawa, most notably the Makino clan. The area prospered during the Edo period with two post towns along the Tōkaidō, Goyu-shuku and Akasaka.
After the Meiji Restoration, on October 1, 1889 several villages were organized with the establishment of the modern municipalities system within Hoi District, Aichi Prefecture, including Toyokawa Village.
