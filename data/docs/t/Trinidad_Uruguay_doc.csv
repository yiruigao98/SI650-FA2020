Formerly it was called Santísima Trinidad de los Porongos, or simply Porongos. Its inhabitants are known as trinitarios or also as porongueros because the city is located near the Porongos stream.


== Location ==
Trinidad is located in the central area of Flores department, on Cuchilla Porongos, between the Sarandí and Porongos streams and on the intersection of Route 3 with Route 14.

== History ==
Initially it was called "Porongos". Even to this day, the inhabitants of the city are referred to as either 'trinitarios' or 'porongueros'.
Porongos was founded on 18 July 1805 by General José Gervasio Artigas, the Uruguayan independence leader. It had acquired the status of "Pueblo" (village) before the Independence of Uruguay. It reached the status of "Villa" (town) under the name "Villa de Porongos". It was renamed to "Villa de la Santísima Trinidad" (Most Holy Trinity) and became capital of the newly created Department of Flores on 30 December 1885 by the Act of Ley Nº 1.854. Its naming reflects a less secular period in the country's history.
In July 1903 it was renamed "Trinidad" and its status was elevated to "Ciudad" (city) by the Act of Ley Nº 2.829.


== Population ==
In 2011, Trinidad had a population of 21,429. This makes Trinidad the largest city by far in the department of Flores.
