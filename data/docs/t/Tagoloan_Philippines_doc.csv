The increase in poultry production was mainly due to the advent of broiler contract growing in the area. Multinational companies led by Swift, San Miguel Corporation, and Vitarich contributed to the growth of poultry production.The cattle population of Tagoloan has decreased from 2,356 heads in 2002 to 1,102 heads in 2003.
