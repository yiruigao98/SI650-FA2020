Teoloyucan is a city and municipality located in State of Mexico, Mexico. It lies 45 km (28 mi) north of the Federal District (Distrito Federal) in the northeastern part of the state of México, and is part of the Greater Mexico City urban area. During the colonial period the area's name had a number of variations, including Teohuilloyocan, Teohuilloyucan, Theoloyucan, Teoloyucan Coaquileque and Tehuilloyocan. The name comes from Nahuatl meaning place of glass or place of crystal rock.


== The city ==

According to the Mendocino Codex, the settlement is mentioned as Itzcoatl conquered this area, meaning it existed prior to 1436, probably owing its importance to its proximity to Cuautitlán. After the Spanish Conquest, in 1565, the area and its people were entrusted to Alonso de Ávila Alvarado. The Franciscans came a year later to evangelize. In 1570 the town was described as having four principal districts divided into 8 neighborhoods each, indicating the area was already well-organized with a population of over 1,000 people, half of whom were Mexica and the other half Otomi. The population of the city as of 2010 was 63,115.The city has two notable churches from the 17th century, the Church of Santa Cruz and the Church of San Juan. There are also plans to establish the Museo Comunitario de Teoloyucan (Community Museum of Teoloyucan). The city's patron saint is San Antonio de Padua.The Magnetic Observatory of Teoloyucan was originally established in the School of Mining in Mexico City in the 18th century by Antonio Alzate and Alexander von Humboldt. In 1903, it was moved to Cuajimalpa then again to its current location in 1911 due to the development of the Mexico City metropolitan area. It was originally located in the town's municipal palace but when this building was remodeled in 1978, the observatory again moved to its current location next to the municipal cemetery at the town's edge.
