== History ==
The city was founded on 1 November 1966. Takaishi established a sister city relationship with Lomita, California in October 1981. It once experienced a severe financial crisis in the late 1990s and the then mayor attempted to merge the city with Sakai. However, the merger became the major campaign issue in the following mayoral election, and was voted down when the incumbent mayor lost in his bid for re-election. The city still remains independent.


== Geography ==
Takaishi occupies a position on the shore of Osaka Bay. Adjacent cities are Sakai, Izumiōtsu and Izumi. About half of the city area lies on reclaimed land, upon which stands a large petrochemical refinery. Takaishi's fire department boasts the largest fire truck in Japan as a precaution against possible major fires at the refinery.
