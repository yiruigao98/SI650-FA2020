Tongren (simplified Chinese: 铜仁; traditional Chinese: 銅仁; pinyin: Tóngrén) is a prefecture-level city in eastern Guizhou province, People's Republic of China, located within a tobacco planting and crop agricultural area. Tongren was known as Tongren Prefecture (铜仁地区) until November 2011, when it was converted into a prefecture-level city.

During the Yongle period (1403–1424) of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), two local governments known as "Sizhou Xuanweisi" (思州宣慰司)and "Sinan Xuanweisi" (思南宣慰司) resisted full subjugation. Yongle Emperor sent troops to pacify the rebellion and set up a provincial administrative region known as "Guizhou Buzhengshisi" (贵州布政使司). Since then, their administrators were appointed by the central government.
