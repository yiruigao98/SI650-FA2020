== Monuments ==
Historic monuments in Torbat-e Jam, Khorasan province, are under serious threat of destruction.
The head of Torbat-e Jam Cultural Heritage and Tourism Department put the credits allocated for restoration of historic sites in the city at 550 million rials in the current year (started March 21). He noted that from the total amount, 500 million rials would be spent on Robat-e Jam historic site and the rest on Sheikh Ahmad Jami mausoleum—a complex comprising 10 buildings, ISNA reported. Taj-Mohammadi complained that given the number of monuments and the huge workload, the earmarked budget is insufficient. The other major historic sites of this northeastern city which face destruction are Robat-e Sangan, Khajeh Azizollah Mosque, Shah Qassem Anvar Mausoleum, Noor Mosque and Abouzar Bozjani Mausoleum, he warned. Torbat-e Jam is the birth and burial place of the renowned 11th century mystic Sheikh Ahmad Jami. The city is in fact named after the great mystic. Located on the mountains 163 kilometers east of Mashhad, Torbat-e Jam has a desert climate with wild pistachio forests and vast pastures. Torbat-e Jam and its neighboring areas have a rich and beautiful local and mystical music.
