Koh-e-Murad (Balochi: كوه مراد‎) is a shrine located in Turbat. This is a sacred place for Zikris. They believe that Mahdi the 12th imam had travelled to this place, and offered prayers for a long time. The followers of Zikri sect gather here annually on the night of 27th Ramadan for a ritual visit (Arabic: زيارة‎, Balochi: زيارت‎) to this shrine. And Turbat also has multilingual singers.
The town has a special place in Baloch folklore and literatures as it is the home of Punnu, hero of the romance of Sassi Punnun. The remains of Punnu's fort can still be seen at Turbat.Atta Shad, who is considered as one of the greatest poets of Balochi literature was also born in Singanisar, a town in Turbat city. He was not only versatile in Balochi poetry, but he was also greatly appreciated for his contribution in Urdu poetry. He was unique in his diction and style. He is credited to have written four books that include two Balochi books, Rochgir and Shap sahar indem, and two Urdu books, Singaab and Barfag. He died on 13 February 1998 in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Turbat is the birthplace of Qadir Bukhsh Rind Baloch alias Kadu Makrani was a 19th-century archetypal figure who was born and brought up in Makran, Balochistan.

Koh-e-Imam lake is a Holy Place, its mountainous range stretches more than 15–25 km from main Kech (Turbat) City. Where you find many picnic points as there are many natural water reservoirs, during rainy seasons.
In koh-e-imam there are also centuries old tombs we call them DAMD in Balochi Language. They are mysterious in a sense that people still don't find facts about the tombs aside of the river which is almost more than 100 km.
Besides, Turbat is considered to be one of the main hubs of separatist insurgent groups active against Pakistani armed forces and the development projects running under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The city has also witnessed violence against non-local men who have either come for business or serving government officials from other parts of Pakistan mostly from the Punjab province. The city has come under discussion on media because of the attacks on non-local men or labourers of companies working on development projects. The city holds many military check points at the surroundings because of the security situation affected by the separatist insurgency. The security situation is now much improved.
