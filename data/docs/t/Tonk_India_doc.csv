The founder of the state and its first ruler was Nawab Muhammad Amir Khan (1769â€“1834), an adventurer and military leader of Pashtun descent from Afghanistan. Amir Khan rose to be a military commander. In 1806, Khan conquered the area, taking it from Yashwant Rao Holkar. The British government captured it in turn. Khan then received the state of Tonk from the British Government who returned it. In 1817, after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Amir Khan submitted to the British British East India Company and kept his territory of Tonk while receiving the title of Nawab. Tonk was founded one year later after Khan was granted land by the ruler of Indore.
