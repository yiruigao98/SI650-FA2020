=== Local events ===
Makomo-nage（マコモ投げ), an annual event, where people throw bunches of long makomo leaves like javelins, trying to be the one who achieves the greatest distance. The makomo is a relative of wild rice, though it's cultivated not for the grains, but for the base of the stalk, which has a mild flavor and a texture similar to bamboo shoots. Makomo is in season in October.


== Town Symbols ==
Tsubata has four town mascots: Yoshinaka-kun(よしなかくん), Tomoe-chan (ともえちゃん), Ka-kun (カーくん)  and Mo-chan(モーちゃん). They are modeled after a possibly fictional battle that took place in the hills that lie between what are now Tsubata and Oyabe in Toyama. During the Genpei War  between the Genji and Heike clans in 12th century), Genji general Kiso Yoshinaka is said to have defeated a large Heike army by driving bulls with flaming torches attached to their horns (カーくん and モーちゃん) into the enemy camp in the dead of night, causing the Heike to panic and flee. The battle is called the Battle of Kurikara. Tomoe Gozen was one of Yoshinaka's wives and a female samurai.
The town crest is a stylized rendition of the characters for “Tsuba” (written in katakana as ツバ). The shape of a flying bird signifies Tsubata's soaring industrial and cultural development, while the figure in the center, its feet firmly planted on the earth, represents stability. The circle represents harmony and peace.
The town logo is warm and soft, expressing Tsubata's familiarity and friendliness. Overlaying the brightly shining sun, “1-2-3” (the English word “sun” sounds like the Japanese word for the number three, “san”) signifies Tsubata's progress.  Beneath the words are three lines. The green like symbolizes the richness of the greenery that grows throughout Tsubata. The dark blue line represents Tsubata's bright blue sky, while the light blue line stands for the pure water that Tsubata's rich natural environment provides.
