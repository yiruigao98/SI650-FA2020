== The city ==

The area was first settled by the Chichimecas, followed by the Otomis in the seventh century. After the Spanish Conquest, Tultepec was given to the conquistador Alonso Ávila along with the current municipalities of Zumpango, Xaltocán, Huehuetoca, Coyotepec, Teoloyucan and others, as part of the Encomienda de Cuautitlán. The modern town of Tultepec began to take shape around 1610 in the valley next to a small elevation called San Martín. Franciscans came to evangelize the new community, dedicating it to the Nativity of Holy Mary and constructing a temple in 1618. This temple, later a parish, was renovated between 1948 and 1955.The town and municipality boast of a number of musicians and painters including Hernesto Urbán Rodríguez (1894), Ricardo Vázquez Pineda (1894), Victor Manuel Urbán Silva (1894), Andrés Urbán (1870) and Prudenciano García (1880), as well as modern composers such as Victor Urbán Velasco, Gerardo Urbán Velásco, Francisco Vázquez García, Francisco Romero Linares, and J. Isabel Vázquez Solano.  Better-known painters include Miguel Hernández Urbán, Joaquín González Romero, Margarito González Solano, Gregorio González Solano, and Albino Luna Sánchez.  It is the home of a folk dance group that has toured the United States and Europe.

In the past, when the town was still rural, the economy was based on products such as pulque, animal feed, salt and tequesquite as well as domestic fowl and other small animals, mostly to be sold in Mexico City.Nowadays, the pyrotechnics industry is the major industry in Tultepec.  Every year, the town throws a weeklong festival with fireworks competitions among various producers.Many pioneers in pyrotechnics came from Tultepec, including Agustín, Miguel and Gregorio Fiesco (1880); José Solano Urbán (1900–1920), who revolutionized firework sets and castles; Felipe Reyes, who worked on the colors red and yellow around 1920; Ángel Guadalupe Flores, who around 1920 invented star fireworks and sparklers as well as several types of rockets; Cirilo Sánchez (1920), who worked on aerostatic balloons; as well as Tomás Romero, Ángel Urbán Rivero, Marcos Romero, and Felipe Fiesco, who innovated such items as the electric target, the spider bomb, and two-figure wheels between 1930 and 1934.The city and municipality hosts the annual National Pyrotechnic Festival.
