== Places and events of importance ==


=== Thunchan Parambu ===

The birthplace of Thunjathu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan, the father of Malayalam language.
The famous "Thunchan Utsavam" is held here every year in the first week of February. During this festival many literary luminaries, singers and classical dancers gather here.
Thunchan Parambu is located in Annara, 1.5 km away from Tirur railway station. A memorial for the great poet has been built at Thunchan Parambu, where a week-long literary mela is organised in the last week of December. This place is sacred for all who speak Malayalam.

Thunchan Paramba is a hallowed ground where hundreds of children are introduced into the world of writing, soon after infancy, when they first trace the letters of the Malayalam alphabets in sand taken from that revered spot which was Ezhuthachan's home. People in thousands reach Thunchan Parambu with their children, to initiate them into the world of letters on the Vijayadasami day. Children are made to write on the white sands of Thunchan Parambu with their fingers. Also young poets of Kerala come on that day to offer their first poem. A Nux vomica (കാഞ്ഞിരം) tree, the leaves of which are not bitter, is a surprise at the Thunchan Parambu.

The well-known vedic Vidyalaya Othanmar Madom of ancient times, is on the bank of Bharathapuzha, near the Siva Temple. This madom was a centre of Aryanisation through Sanskrit and Vedic education, as Thirunavaya was believed to be the main centre where Parasurama brought and settled Brahmins.
The Palace (Mana) of Puranic fame Azhvanchery Thamprakkal is 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north of Thirunnavaya.
Chandanakavu, the birthplace of the great 16th-century Sanskrit poet and grammarian Melapthur Narayana Bahttathiri, is 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Tirur on the Thirunnavaya-Kottakal road. A memorial has been built there for the poet, where small children are brought for their formal initiation into learning on Vijayadasami day, as in Thunjan parambu.

Pitru Tharpanam is a ritual, held here on the day of Amavasi in Karkidakam (July–August). Balikarma is offered by people in their wet clothes, after a dip in the river, for the salvation of sins and to appease the manes.The martial arts festival Kalripayattu is conducted during summer on the sands of dry Bharathapuzha. The well known Changampalli Kalari, is near Thirunavaya.
During the second week of February a Sarvodaya Mela is conducted in Thirunavaya where the Gandhians of Kerala used to assemble. The Santikudeeram, established by the nationalist leader K. Kelappan, is the centre of this mela gathering.


=== Wagon Tragedy ===

The Wagon Tragedy was the death of a large number of prisoners on 10 November 1921 in the Malabar region of Kerala state of India. The prisoners had been taken into custody following unrest known as Moplah rebellion in Malabar, and their deaths through apparent negligence discredited the British Raj and generated sympathy for the Indian independence movement.
Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and the national leaders of India, there was a widespread and peaceful uprising against the British colonial rule of India. After a series of events that culminated in violent clashes between police and protesters, Martial law was introduced and the rebellion mostly crushed. The British packed 70 prisoners into a railway goods wagon at Tirur railway station to be sent to the Coimbatore jails. By the time they reached their destination 61 of the prisoners had died from suffocation.


== Places of worship ==


=== Garudan Kavu ===
Situated 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from Tirur, Garudan Kavu is the only temple in India dedicated to Garuda, the bird deity. 
This Garuda Temple is about 1800 years old. Worshipping here is mainly meant for easy recovery from diseases and for relief from serpent poisons. All Sundays are important here especially the 41 days of Mandalakalam (from 16 November to 28 December). It is said that the legendary Perumthachan was the architect of this Garuda statue in the temple. Permuthachan built the temple for the Raja of the Kingdom of Tanur (Vettathunad).
A rare ecological practice
Live snakes are offered before Lord Garuda here. People affected by snakes arrive at the temple with live snakes caught in earthen pots covered by cotton clothes. When the temple is open from the gopura the pot is thrown to the temple. The snake will stand up aggressively after this event. The shanthi of the temple will come with Garuda Panchaksari manthra theertha and anoint the arrived snake with it. Then the snake will crawl to the south and is seen no more thereafter. It has become the food for Garuda as it were!
It is a miracle that the temple or its neighbourhood does not get infested with poisonous snakes gradually as could logically be deduced. There is no story of any body receiving a snake bite from the temple for hundreds of years, in spite of this strange practice from devotees.


=== Alathiyur Hanuman Kavu Temple ===
 
Alathiyoor is a small town in Tirur. The Alathiyur Hanuman Kavu temple is about 8 km from Tirur railway station. Thousands of pilgrims from all over India come here to worship lord Hanuman. This is supposedly the place where Lord Rama described Sita, and gave Hanuman his ring to authenticate Hanuman as his messenger, and sent him off to visit Sita in Lanka, where she was being held captive by Ravana. This is supposedly the spot where Hanuman took a huge leap towards Lanka. The speciality of this temple is that Lakshmana, Lord Rama's brother, has a separate Sanctum. It seems that Lord Rama asked Lashmana to leave the room when he was describing Sita and giving Hanuman his ring. Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana were inseparable, and so this temple is sort of unique in that they are not together. It is believed that alathiyoor Perumthikovil ('Hanuman Kavu') Temple was erected and consecrated by Sage Vasishta, who is prominent among the Saptarshis, some 3000 years ago.


=== Chamravattom Sastha Temple ===
Chamravattom is a small town in Tirur. Chamravattom Sastha Temple is located 15 km away from Tirur, on the banks of Bharathapuzha.

=== Triprangode Kalasamharamurthy temple ===
 
Triprangode Siva temple is also nearby which has historical importance too. The legend behind the temple is that Markandeyan, a very young devotee of Lord Siva, who had his parents to take care of, was scheduled to die at a very young age. When lord Yama came to take his soul away, Markandeyan approached Lord Vishnu (at the Navamukundan temple), to request him to save him from death. Lord Vishnu had to turn him down, and direct him to request Lord Siva instead. So off Markandeya goes to Lord Siva. He is said to have embraced a Siva Linga at the Triprangode temple, and Lord Siva is said to have killed Yama, the messenger of death, at this spot. There are a total of five Siva lingas at this temple. The first being the linga that Markandeyan embraced, the next three being the steps that Lord Siva took on the way to killing Lord Yama, and the last being the extremely angry Lord Siva, immediately after killing Lord Yama.
