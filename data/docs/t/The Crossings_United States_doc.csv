There are 50 places where people can legally cross the Mexico–United States border.  Several large border cities have multiple crossings, often including one or more that bypass the center of the city and are designated for truck traffic.  For planned crossings, see the Proposed crossings section below.  For former border crossings, see the Closed crossings section below.  Details on each of the US ports of entry are provided using the links in the table.
