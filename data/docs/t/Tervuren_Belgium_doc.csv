The Tervuren (, sometimes spelled Tervueren), is a breed of dog named after a town in Belgium. Its classification varies, being classified under some breed standards as a breed in its own right, and in others as one of several acceptable variations of the Belgian Shepherd Dog. It is usually listed within breed standards under one or other, or a combination, of these names.


== Description ==

The Tervuren is a medium sized athletic breed, they typically stand between 56 and 66 centimetres (22 and 26 in) with bitches being on average 6 centimetres (2.4 in) shorter than dogs, and usually weigh between 20 and 30 kilograms (44 and 66 lb). The Tervuren has a double coat with a long haired outer coat and a thick, dense undercoat; they are typically fawn overlaid with black in colour, although grey with black is known, it has a ruff of long hair around the neck and feathering on the legs. The breed has a long, slender head with erect ears and short hair on the face, the muzzle is typically black.


== History ==
Along with the Groenendael, Laekenois and Malinois, the Tervuren is one of four regional varieties of Belgian Shepherds, it takes its name from the municipality of Tervuren; as with the other varieties, the Tervuren was used for centuries as a herding dog by Belgian shepherds. By the end of the 19th-century all of the Belgian Shepherds were becoming obsolete and were at danger of extinction so in 1891 the Club de Chien Berger Belge was formed with the purpose of saving the type. The same year Professor Adolphe Reul of the Cureghem Veterinary School conducted a field survey of the type who classified them into three of the four varieties known today, his team assembled 117 specimens and began the process of standardising them into the three distinct varieties based primarily on coat type, in 1897 Laekenois was added as a forth variety. The breed suffered greatly during the Second World War and was almost extinct by 1945, but through careful breeding the variety recovered throughout the second half of the 20th-century.


== Activities ==
Tervuren can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Belgian Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.
