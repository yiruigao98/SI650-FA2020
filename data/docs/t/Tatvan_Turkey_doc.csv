Tatvan (Armenian: Դատվան Datvan, Kurdish: Tetwan) is a city on the western shore of Lake Van. It is the chief city of Tatvan District within Bitlis Province in eastern Turkey, and has about 96,000 inhabitants. The current Mayor is Mehmet Emin Geylani (AKP).


== Transport ==
The Tatvan Pier railway station, which is the eastern terminus of the railway line between Ankara and Teheran, with freight and passenger trains. It is connected eastwards to Van, 100 km away, and westwards to the rest of Turkey, by State Road D300. There is also a train ferry across the lake Van. The ferry was upgraded in 2015.
There is no railway around the lake to Van; it is intended eventually to build one but to date there are no plans. This would actually create an unbroken rail link between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, as Van is effectively the western terminus of the Iranian railway network.
There is Bus station about 500 meters from the train station.
