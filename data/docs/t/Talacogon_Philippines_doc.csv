== History ==
Talacogon got its name from the cogon grass that is abundant in the area. It was called so by the natives who inhabit the area before the entry of the Spanish in the Agusan River basin sometime in the 18th century. The Spanish who came in the area then adopted the name of the place as they founded it as a town in the 13th of November 1872, building a church and a town hall as commemoration to its founding. It was thus the first town founded in the riverbanks of the Agusan River and the oldest town in the province of Agusan del Sur.
As the years went on, Talacogon only experienced slow progress due to its inaccessibility and remoteness to other parts of Mindanao. It was only in the 1970's to 1990's that roads begun being built in the area from which the municipality then experienced rapid progress, due in part to facilitate the logging business in the area.Being a town since 1872, Talacogon remains the economic center of the province west of the Agusan River.
