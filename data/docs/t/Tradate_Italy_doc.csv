== The origin of the name ==
The name "Tradate" has uncertain origins. There are two different interpretations about its creation:

The historian Gerhard Rohlfs thought that the name came from the first name Theodorus
Antonio Olivieri, instead, thought that the denomination came from the Germanic name Teuderad, that transformed afterwards into Tederate.


== History ==
In Roman times, the Mediolanum-Bilitio road passed through Tradate's territory. This road connected Mediolanum (Milan) and Luganum (Lugano), passing through Varisium (Varese). 
This territory, was thought to be inhabitated since the Romans, and continued to be during the barbarian migrations, that brought to the fall of the Roman Empire.
