The Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan (Malay: Menara Jam Condong Teluk Intan) is a clock tower in Teluk Intan, Hilir Perak District, Perak, Malaysia. It is the Malaysian equivalent of the world-famous Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy. The tower is slanted leftward, similar to the Tower of Pisa. It is 25.5 metres tall and, from the outside, looks like an 8 storey building, though inside it is actually divided into 3 storeys.


== Specialty ==
The specialty for building the tower, also known as the Clock Tower, was to store water for the locals during the drought season, in case of fire. The clock on the tower was also used to keep time.


== History ==
The tower was built under the guidance of contractor Leong Choon Chong in 1885, late in the 19th century. However, it was claimed by a Briton, Neol Danison, and then the Japanese during their occupation of Malaysia in 1941. During this time, the tower became the Japaneseâ€™s watch tower.
After Independence, in the year 1957, the tower became an official national monument.


== Design ==
The pagoda style structure was greatly influenced by Chinese architecture, because the majority of the population of the town at that time was Chinese. Each storey is 5 metres high and there are a total of 110 steps from the ground floor to the top of the tower.
The water tank, which is 5 metres high and 18.36 cubic metres deep, is on the third floor and is made of steel. The foundation is 13 metres in diameter and tapers to a diameter of 8.2 metres at the top of the tower.


=== Leaning ===
The reasons why the tower leans is the soft ground on which it was built, as well as the weight of the water in the water tank, which causes it to lean towards the southwest.
