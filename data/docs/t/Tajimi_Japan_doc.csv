== History ==
The area around Tajimi was part of traditional Mino Province.  During the Edo period, much of the area was tenryō territory under the direct control of Tokugawa shogunate.  In the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, Toki District in Gifu Prefecture was created, and the town of Tajimi was established on July 1, 1889 by the creation of the modern municipalities system. Tajimi annexed the town of Toyota from neighbouring Kani District in 1934, and was raised to city status on August 1, 1940.
Tajimi subsequently annexed the villages of Koizimi and Ikeda from Kani District in 1944, and the villages of Ichinokura and Kasahara from Toki District in 1951. On January 23, 2006 the town of Kasahara (from Toki District) was merged into Tajimi.
