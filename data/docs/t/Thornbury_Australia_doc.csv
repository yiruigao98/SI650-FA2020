Thornbury ( (listen)) is an inner suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 7 km north of Melbourne's Central Business District. Its local government area is the City of Darebin. At the 2016 census, Thornbury had a population of 18,568.
Thornbury is bordered by the Merri Creek to the west, and the Darebin Creek to the east. The heart of Thornbury is known as Thornbury Village, and is located at the centre of Thornbury at the intersection of High Street and Normanby Avenue/Clarendon Street.
Thornbury is shaped as a thin strip of land sandwiched between Northcote and Preston. Its east-west width being over six times greater than its northâ€“south width. For 111 years Thornbury was part of the former City of Northcote Local Government Area, which existed from 1883 until June 1994.
