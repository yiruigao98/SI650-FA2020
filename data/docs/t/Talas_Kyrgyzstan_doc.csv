For the medieval city of "Talas" see Taraz. For information on the Buffalo, NY band, see Billy Sheehan.Talas is a town in northwestern Kyrgyzstan, located in the Talas River valley between two mountain ranges. Its area is 13 square kilometres (5.0 sq mi), and its resident population was 32,886 in 2009. It is the administrative headquarters of Talas Region.  The town was founded by East Slavic settlers in 1877. To the south is the Besh-Tash (‘five rocks’) valley with the Besh-Tash National Park.


== Overview ==
Its economy has traditionally been oriented towards the ancient city of Taraz (once named Talas and Dzhambul) in present day Kazakhstan. The Talas valley has suffered severely from the imposition of rigid border controls by Kazakhstan following the demise of the Soviet Union, as transport and trade links to the rest of Kyrgyzstan are now constrained by the mountains separating it from the Chuy Valley and Bishkek. Though much transportation does occur from Bishkek to Talas by transiting through Kazakhstan via the border crossings at Chaldovar in Chuy and then re-crossing into the Talas valley of Kyrgyzstan at Taraz.  The only drivable road within the borders of Kyrgyzstan to Bishkek and the rest of the country crosses two mountain passes that rise to heights of more than 3000 meters above sea level over the Ötmök Pass into the Suusamyr Valley and then again the Töö Ashuu Pass before descending to the Chuy Valley and Bishkek.


== Climate ==
Talas has a warm, dry-summer continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dsb).


== Manas ==
Manas, the mythical Kyrgyz national hero, is said to have been born in the Ala Too mountains in Talas oblast. A few kilometers outside Talas lies a mausoleum, supposedly that of Manas, called the Kümböz Manas. However, the inscription on its richly decorated facade dedicates it to "...the most glorious of women Kenizek-Khatun, the daughter of the Emir Abuka". Legend explains that Manas' wife Kanikey ordered a deliberately false inscription in order to mislead her husband's enemies and prevent the desecration of his body. The building, known as Manastin Khumbuzu or The Ghumbez of Manas, is thought to have been built in 1334. It now contains a museum dedicated to the epic. A ceremonial mound also lies nearby.


== Sports ==
The town has a bandy club.
