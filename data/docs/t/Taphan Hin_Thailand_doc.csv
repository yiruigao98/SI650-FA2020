Taphan Hin railway station is a railway station located in Taphan Hin Subdistrict, Taphan Hin District, Phichit. It is located 319.006 km from Bangkok railway station and is a class 1 railway station. It is on the Northern Line of the State Railway of Thailand. The station opened on 24 January 1908 as part of the Northern Line extension from Pak Nam Pho to Phitsanulok. All trains used to stop here as Taphan Hin was once the largest city in Phichit, but now Phichit City has surpassed it in terms of development and so all trains stop there instead and pass this station.
