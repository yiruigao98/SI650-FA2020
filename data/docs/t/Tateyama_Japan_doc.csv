The area of present-day Tateyama was part of ancient Awa Province, dominated by the Satomi clan during the Sengoku period, who ruled from Tateyama Castle. After the Edo period, most of the territory was part of the feudal domain of Tateyama Domain (館山藩, Tateyama-han). After the start of the Meiji period, Tateyama Town (in Awa District), Chiba Prefecture was proclaimed on April 1, 1889. It annexed neighboring Toyosu Village on April 1, 1914, and merged with Hōjō Town to form Tateyamahōjō Town on April 18, 1933.
The city of Tateyama was proclaimed on November 3, 1939, with the merger of Tateyamahōjō with Nago and Funagata towns. The city was a base for the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service until the end of World War II. Tateyama expanded on May 3, 1954 by annexing six surrounding villages.
