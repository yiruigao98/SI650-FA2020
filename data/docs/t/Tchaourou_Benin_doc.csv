Tchaourou (Saworo in Yoruba etymology, meaning rattle) is a commune, arrondissement, and city located in the Borgou Department of Benin, a country in Western Africa, formerly known as Dahomey (until 1975). It is the birthplace of former Beninese president Yayi Boni. It is 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of Parakou.

The commune covers an area of 7,256 km2 (2,802 sq mi) and as of 2013 had a population of 221,108 people., while the Tchaourou city proper has a population of 106,852 people, making it the 10th largest settlement in Benin.
As an arrondissement and commune, Tchaourou is one of the largest municipalities in the Borgu department of Benin. It is home to people of various ethnic groups, mainly Yoruba people, also known as Anago or Nago, Bariba and Fulani peoples. Tchaourou is a mainly agricultural town. However, illegal activities in the sale of fuel have developed in the region, given its proximity to its major oil neighbour, Nigeria. The current mayor is Soul√© Biyaou Abou.As a result of the seasonal migration several fodder trees such as Khaya senegalensis and Afzelia africana, which were common, are now very rare in the town. The disappearance of valuable species of trees, is caused by a combination of slash-and-burn shifting cultivation and exploitation of wood. Deforestation is very common, particularly logging for tree bark used in traditional medicines made by the Fulani herdsmen.v
