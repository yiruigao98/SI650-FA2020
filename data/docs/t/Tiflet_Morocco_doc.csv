Tifelt is a town that was served by workers of the United States Peace Corps until the attack on America of September 11, 2001. The Peace Corps workers had been assisting local women in a beekeeping cooperative, until the U.S. government evacuated the Peace Corps personnel for concerns over their safety.  Peace Corps workers have since returned and now focus primarily on job skills workshops and English language classes.
