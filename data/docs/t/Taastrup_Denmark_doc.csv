Taastrup (Danish pronunciation: [ˈtsʰɒstʁɔp]) is a Danish railway town or/and suburb of Copenhagen - 15 km west of the capital's city centre, and formerly the administrative seat of Høje-Taastrup Municipality, Region Hovedstaden. It takes its name from the village of Taastrup Valby, which also gave its name to the station established in 1859, from which the town grew. The population on 1 January 2020 was 34,364. It forms a twin (sub)urban area with neighbouring suburb Høje Taastrup since the 1980s, that has engulfed the villages of Taastrup Valby, Høje Taastrup, Kragehave and Klovtofte. This area has almost grown together with the town of Hedehusene.
