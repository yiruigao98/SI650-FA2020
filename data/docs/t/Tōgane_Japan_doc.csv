Tōgane was founded on April 1, 1889 as part of Sanbe District, Chiba Prefecture. Sanbe District became Sanbu District on April 1, 1897. The town expanded on April 1, 1953 through annexation of the neighboring villages of Okayama, Masaki, Toyonari, Kohei and a portion of the village of Yamato. It was elevated to city status on April 1, 1954 after further expansion through annexation of parts of the neighboring villages of Hara and Fukuoka.


== Economy ==
Tōgane is known for strawberry picking in February and March.  Strawberries are grown in greenhouses.  Because there is not much industry remaining in some rural areas of Japan like Tōgane, antique markets are gaining popularity as old farmhouses are torn down.
