== History ==
Tsu originally developed as a port town known as Anotsu (安濃津) in the Nara and Heian periods. The port was destroyed by a tsunami in the 1498 Meiō Nankaidō earthquake. The town was rebuilt as a castle town and a post station by the Tōdō clan, daimyō of Tsu Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. During the Edo period, it became a popular stopping point for travelers to Ise shrine, about 40 km to the southeast.
Following the Meiji Restoration, it became the capital of Mie Prefecture in 1871. With the establishment of municipalities on April 1, 1889, Tsu was one of the original 31 cities to be proclaimed.
During World War II, Allied air raids on July 24 and July 28, 1945, destroyed most of the city and killed 1,239 people
On January 1, 2006, the neighboring city of Hisai, the towns of Anō, Geinō and Kawage, and the village of Misato (all in Age District), the towns of Hakusan, Ichishi and Karasu, and the village of Misugi (all in Ichishi District) were merged into Tsu. As a result of the merger, the city became the second largest in Mie by population behind Yokkaichi, and the largest in Mie by area ahead of Matsusaka.
