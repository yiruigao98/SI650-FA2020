Třinec (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtr̝̊ɪnɛts] (listen); Polish: Trzyniec, German: Trzynietz) is a statutory city in Frýdek-Místek District, Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It lies on the Olza River, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The city has approximately 35,000 inhabitants and is the smallest statutory city in the Czech Republic. In the 2001 census, 17.7% of the population were Poles. The city is notable for its steel plant, the Třinec Iron and Steel Works, the largest in the Czech Republic, which still has a major impact on the city, on its character, demographics, and air quality.
Třinec is also an important cultural center of the Polish minority in Zaolzie.


== Etymology ==
The name Třinec is of topographic origin, derived from the Polish word for reed (Polish: trzcina, locally trzena // trzyna, strzena, trzcena).


== History ==
The village of Třinec was founded in the 14th century and first mentioned in 1461, when a person z [from] Trencze was attested to. Politically, the village then belonged to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.
The majority of the population worked in agriculture. The area was, however, rich in limestone, iron ore, and clay. The region also offered a large enough workforce, so it was decided to build an iron works there. In 1836, construction of the first metallurgical furnace had begun. The iron mill began operation in 1839, becoming the largest in the entire Cieszyn Silesia. The first schools (Polish-German) in Třinec were opened by the initiative of the iron works in 1851. After the construction of the Košice-Bohumín Railway line in 1871, rapid development of the town took place.
After the revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was added to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900, and 1910, the population of the municipality grew from 1,792 in 1880 to 3,849 in 1910, with a majority being native Polish-speakers (growing from 51.4% in 1880 to 96.6% in 1900 and 96% in 1910), accompanied by a German-speaking minority (at most 32.5% in 1880, then dropping to 12.2% in 1900 and up to 24.3% in 1910) and Czech-speakers (peaking in 1890 at 17.4%, then dropping to 6.7% in 1910). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (63.2%), followed by Protestants (34.5%), Jews (76 or 1.9%), and 13 people adhering to another faith. The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking the Cieszyn Silesian dialect.
After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War, and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Třinec gained town rights in 1931. Following the Munich Agreement in October 1938, together with the Zaolzie region, it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of the Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war, it was restored to Czechoslovakia.
In 1946, it was merged with the village of Lyžbice, where in the 1950s the ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia began large-scale development in the style of socialist realism. Afterwards, Lyžbice became a new downtown, taking the place of Staré Město (lit. Old Town).
