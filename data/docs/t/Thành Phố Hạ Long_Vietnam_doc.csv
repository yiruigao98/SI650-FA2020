== History ==
Humankind has been present on Hạ Long Bay for a long time. Over the years, archaeologists, researchers concluded that over the course of history, there were three cultures known as Soi Nhu, Hạ Long and Cai Beo culture. It shows that the bay and its surrounding areas were one of the cradles of mankind.
The heartland of today's Hạ Long City is formerly just a fishing village, called the Oyster Coast. By the beginning of the Nguyễn Dynasty, it was renamed to Mau Le. The current city was then part of Hoành Bồ District.
In 1883, during the French occupation era, the French carried out coal mining in the mines on the Gulf Coast. As on many islands there were lots of hemp so the French called them Ile des brouilles or a name translated from Hon Gai to Hon Gay, later renamed Hon Gai. According to the researchers, "Hon Gai" is a deviation from the place of the French Red Sea at that time. The "H" in French is a silent sound. During this period, Hon Gai was an administrative unit of Quảng Yên Province.
After the August Revolution in 1945, this township became the capital town of the huge Hong Gai mine area. Late in 1946, the French reconquested Hon Gai. After the Geneva Conference (1954), Hong Gai town became the capital of the Hong Quang special district. On October 30, 1963, the Vietnamese government combined Hai Ninh province and Hong Quang special district to create Quảng Ninh Province, Hong Gai became the capital of Quảng Ninh, and the province's boundaries were expanded. The Hong Gai town center provided coal for all industrial zones of North Vietnam. It also was the gateway to China so it was one of the main target of the U.S. during the Vietnam War. The Bãi Cháy Ferry (decommissioned in 2007, replaced with the Bãi Cháy Bridge) was the most important transportation hub, was the target of many American bombardments, and was awarded Hero of the People's Armed Forces 3 times.
On December 27, 1993, the government issued Decree No. 102/CP. Hong Gai town officially gained its city status and was renamed to Hạ Long.
On December 17, 2019, the city's committee announced its intention to incorporate the district of Hoành Bồ into its territories.
