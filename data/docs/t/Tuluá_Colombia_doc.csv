Tuluá (Spanish pronunciation: [tu.lu.ˈä]), is a city located in the heart of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. A major industrial and commercial center, it is the region's fourth-largest city after Cali—the department capital—Buenaventura and Palmira. Founded around 1741 by Juan de Lemos y Aguirre, it has a population of approximately 220,000. It is also known as the Corazón del Valle (meaning 'The Heart of Valle'), as La Villa de Céspedes ('Town of Céspedes', named after the naturalist Juan María Céspedes) and Tierra Fácil ('Easy Land' in the native language).
It is well known throughout Colombia and many parts of South America as a major center of salsa dancing.


== Geography ==

The Tuluá River runs through Tuluá's urban area. The city is located 269 miles from Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, 63 miles northeast of Cali and 108 miles from the important harbor city of Buenaventura, which lies on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Although it has a relatively small urban area, Tuluá's metropolitan area is comparatively big. The city lies between the two westernmost cordilleras of Colombia, about 50 miles east of Buenaventura.


== Climate ==
Located just three degrees north of the equator, the weather in Tuluá is very tropical, with hot, sunny days punctuated by intense storms. Temperatures average 28 degrees Celsius and above. However, the nights are cool. Thanks to the diverse climate, a lot of different vegetables and fruit can be grown in Tuluá.


== Crime ==

Crime is a big problem in Tuluá. According to press reports there have been several massacres in the city in 2010 and 2011, with gunmen using automatic rifles to fire indiscriminately at crowds of people. The surge in murders is allegedly due to rivaling paramilitary gangs Los Urabeños and Los Rastrojos fighting for control of the city's lucrative drug trade.
