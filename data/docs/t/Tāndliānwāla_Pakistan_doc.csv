=== Geology ===
The Tehsil of Tandlianwala is part of the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over 1000 thick. The scalloped interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature flat-topped river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the River Ravi on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the River Ravi. There is also a small river passing through the center of the city.
The soil consists of young stratified silt loams or very fine sand loams which give the subsoil a very weak structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Tandlianwala are winding and often subject to frequent alterations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which last for a number of days. The Rakh and Gogera canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the river Ravi has remained narrow. The river bed includes the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion.
