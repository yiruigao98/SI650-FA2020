== History of Temixco ==


=== Prehispanic History ===
The area around Xochicalco (In the place of the House of Flowers) was settled in about 200 BCE, although the city reached its apex between AD 650 and 900. Xochicalco was mentioned by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún in the 16th century, and it may have been settled by refugees from Teotihuacan. The city traded with populations in Oaxaca, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Gulf of Mexico. According to petrographs found in the Templo de las Serpientes Emplumadas, (Temple of the Feathered Serpents) Xochicalco hosted a meeting with representatives from the Maya area, the Gulf Coast, and Oaxaca to adjust the calendar during a solar eclipse while Xochicalco was at its splendor.In about A.D. 830, the Nahuatl-speaking emigrated to the area south of the mountains of Ajusco, in what is the state of Morelos today. At the time of the formation of the Triple Alliance (1428), the only communities in the modern-day municipality of Temixco were Acatlipa and Cuentepec.


=== Colonial Era ===
After the Spanish conquest of 1521, Hernan Cortes was granted the title Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca including almost all of modern Morelos. The villages of Temixco were Acatlipa, San Agustín Tetlama, and San Sebastián Cuentepec.Martín Cortés, 2nd Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca granted lands to religious orders and wealthy Spanish were able to establish the first sugar-cane plantations or haciendas. On July 29. 1617, Don Francisco Barbero of Copaltepeque established the Hacienda of Temixco on 1,755 hectares of land. Later, additional land was purchased from the native peoples. The first installation was the sugar press (trapiche), and at the beginning of the 18th century, it became an ingenio for production of sugar, rum, alcohol and other products. Other small presses were established at Rivas, Tomalaca, and San José. The hacienda took the name Nuestra Señora de la Concepción (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception).The owner of the hacienda, Miguel de Zia, seized land in Xochitepec and Alpuyeca in 1715 with the support of Fray Simón Roa of the Holy Inquisition. In 1719 the people of these communities complained, but Xochitepec never recovered its land. Indigenous of Alpuyeca rose against the hacienda in 1747, only to be arrested by Fray Miguel de Nava of Cuernavaca.


=== 19th Century ===
In 1808, don Gabriel Joaquín de Yermo celebrated his wife's birthday by freeing 200 slaves from his hacienda in Temixco. This is why so few Black people participated in the Independence movement of 1810 but took the side of the Spanish.Yermo led the September 15, 1808 golpe de estado (French & English: Coup d'état) against Viceroy José de Iturrigaray, who was replaced the following day by Viceroy Pedro de Garibay, ending the criollos' "Patriotas de Fernando VII" attempt to legally achieve independence. When the Mexican War of Independence broke out in 1810, Gabriel Joaquín de Yermo converted the hacienda into a supply center for the Royalists.The State of Mexico was created in 1824, and the District of Cuernavaca was formed. The hacienda of Temixco was included in the municipality of Xochitepec within the District of Cuernavaca. Temixco became part of the State of Morelos when it was formed on April 17, 1869.


=== 20th Century ===
There were two battles in the hacienda of Temixco in 1914. The first was on May 26, when the Zapatistas was able to take the hacienda, and the second was in early June when the Zapatistas used the hacienda as a staging ground for the Siege of Cuernavaca. In 1915, once the Zapatistas took control of Mexico City, they confiscated all the ruined alcohol distilleries. Gral. Genovevo de la O was assigned to get Temixco running again.In 1921 Temixco was elevated to the category of "Congregación" and the town took the name Real de Temixco. It was part of the municipality of Cuernavaca. The Ejido de Temixco was formed in 1924.The Municipality of Temixco was created on March 5, 1933, including the towns of Tetlama, Cuentepec, Acatlipa, and Temixco.On December 8, 1935, the Pueblo Nuevo del Puente (Alta Palmira) was established in Cuernavaca. In 1956 it was transferred to Temixco.In the 1940s the Comité Japonés de Ayuda Mutua (CJAM; "Japanese Committee of Mutual Aid"), a Japanese-Mexican organization based in Mexico City, obtained a hacienda on 200 hectares (490 acres) of land in Temixco from Alejandro Lacy so it could house newly-arriving Japanese coming from other parts of Mexico. In 1942, during World War II, the hacienda of Temixco became a concentration camp. The Japanese had moved in by 1943. A school for Japanese students was established in Temixco to serve those on the hacienda. Eventually, Mexican parents began asking for their children to attend the Temixco Japanese school.The Hacienda of Temixco continued to cultivate sugar cane until 1968 when it became a water park. Today it includes swimming pools, a wave pool, a river, and athletic fields.Due to migration from other states, the population of Temixco grew quickly in the 1970s, and new colonies such as Rubén Jaramillo, Lomas de Guadalupe, 10 de Abril, and La Azteca were added. The town of Pueblo Viejo which previously belonged to Cuernavaca, became a part of Temixco in 1990.The General Mariano Matamoros Airport opened on April 15, 1988 under control of the State of Morelos and came under federal control in 1992.Temixco was elevated to the status of ciudad (city) on March 7, 1990.


=== 21st Century ===
