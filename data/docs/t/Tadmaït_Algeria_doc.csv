== History ==
Camp-du-Maréchal was a colonial village created in lower Kabylia, became Tadmaït in 1963, just after the independence of Algeria


=== French occupation ===

On 14 June 1830, French troops land at Sidi-Ferruch, and enter Algiers on 5 July. About ten years later, Marshal Bugeaud decided to conquer Kabylia. He occupies Bordj Menaiel, 66 kilometers east of Algiers. Then he heads north and occupied Dellys, a coastal town founded during the Turkish presence. When returning from Dellys, going up the Sebaou, he enter the plain of Tadmaït that he occupies. The indigenous population takes refuge at Mount Sidi Ali Bounab and is divided into Thouddar (hamlets).
The marshal established a large camp in preparation for the occupation of the rest of Kabylia. West of the camp (about 6 kilometers), a center is founded by the Society for the protection of Alsatians-Lorrainers remained French (founded in 1871) presided by Count Joseph d'Haussonville. Since 1873, 33 families have settled. At the site of the camp is founded in 1879 a village which will bear the name of the marshal (Marshal Randon).

Taking advantage of the experience, it is, of all the Alsatian villages, the most successful. It's immediately equipped with all the basic infrastructure: town hall, post office, school, church built by native workers. The village is designed only for the needs of settlers and the colonial administration. The fertile lands watered by the Sebaou, are exploited in the same way as the workers who work from sunrise to sunset. That's why the settlers ask to be grouped near the village so that they are more efficient. This is how Tadmaït was born, a group of makeshift dwelling 100 metres high in the village. Other infrastructures are set up such as the college and the dispensary managed by Les soeurs Blanches, railways connecting the village to Algiers and Dellys to transport the productions to Algiers than France. The Marshal's Camp / Camp-du-Maréchal is best known for its vineyards and two wineries (for the production of wine), its orange groves and especially for its tobacco. The " Green olives of Kabylia " produced by the Gayraud house, regularly awarded in the 1930s, were famous even on the European continent.


=== The independence War ===
Several attacks were perpetrated in 1955, people began to join the maquis to take up arms. One of the major events of this war is the one-night attack of 1956 against two depots, one with ammunition and the other with tobacco.
To cope with the new situation, military reinforcements are sent to the village and a barracks is built 500 meters west of Tadmaït. To facilitate access to the maquis and track the mujahideen, roads are open to Mount Sidi Ali Bounab. Starting on 6 p.m, the village is forbidden to the natives. A slum near the station is improvised to accommodate families fleeing the mountain. A city made up of solid houses, two to three rooms is built to accommodate the harkis. Mount Sidi Ali Bounab will not respite until 1962, the Camp-du-Maréchal lost during this war nearly 1000 inhabitants.


=== After independence ===
In 1963, Camp Marshal took the name of Tadmaït. A year later, the barracks is transformed into a vocational training center. The railway linking Tadmaït to Dellys has been removed.
It is from the early 1970s that the village is experiencing significant changes. A whole neighborhood of colonial houses is shaved to make room for a set of buildings. The college is kept as is and the clinic converted into maternity. At the same time, the destruction of the church that will last several years to build a mosque instead begins.
New cities were created, west of the town from the early 1990s (Cité Ferki), then the 2000s (Cité EPLF), as well as a new high school and schools. A second building similar to the old colonial town hall was built in the early 1990s and currently serves as the headquarters of the APC. New subdivisions are developing to the south and south-east of the town (on the heights of the town).
The building that housed the National Gendarmerie dating from the colonial era was blown up by a car bomb attack in the mid-1990s. The Colonial Town Hall and the Lambert School do not stand up to the 2003 earthquake.
A set of tower buildings was built at the northern entrance of the municipality as part of the 2001-2002 AADL project. A new clinic was inaugurated in 2014 (Clinic Chouhada Merzouk - EPSP DBK).
