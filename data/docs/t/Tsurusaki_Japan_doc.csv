== Economy ==
During the 1960s and 1970s, an industrial region was formed along the Beppu Gulf coast. Among the plants in the region were flagship plants of Nippon Steel and Showa Denko.
In the 1970s, Toshiba and Canon built and expanded their plants in inland area. By then, the city emerged as a major production center of electronics products such as LSIs and digital cameras.
The downtown and shopping districts are located to the north of Oita Station. Recently, however, the area has been gradually declining, because the main commercial areas have been dispersed due to the construction of big shopping malls in the suburbs.


== History ==
The Ōita area is historically known as Funai (府内), the capital of Bungo Province (豊後国).
During the Sengoku period (15th–16th centuries), the powerful Ōtomo clan based in Funai and the area prospered as a key port of trade with Portugal and Ming-dynasty China. Ōtomo Sōrin, a famous Christian daimyō, first introduced western culture. It was in Funai that the first western style hospital was built and the first Japanese choir was formed.


== Climate ==
Ōita has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) with hot summers and cool winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is somewhat lower in winter.
