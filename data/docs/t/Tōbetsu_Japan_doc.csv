== Geography ==
Located on the north part of Ishikari Subprefecture of Hokkaido, the shape of the municipality is elongated north to south. It overlaps with the catchment area of the Tōbetsu river approximately. Tōbetsu means "river from marsh" in Ainu language, and in Japanese it is called "Tōbetsu Gawa (river)". Low mountains occupy the northern area of the municipality. The southern area is a part of the Ishikari Plains.
Sapporo, the largest city of Hokkaido, lies on southwest of Tōbetsu. The large river of Ishikari divided Tōbetsu from Sapporo until 1934, when the Sasshō Line railroad connected the two cities. Several more bridges built in the latter half of 20th century have further reduced the traffic obstacle. Tōbetsu has produced rice and recently flowers. Residential buildings are increasing modestly because of its better access to Sapporo.
