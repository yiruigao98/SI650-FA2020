The Titagarh Paper Mills, long established as India's leading manufacturer of specialty papers, currency note paper, and newsprint, produced a total of 38,550 tons of paper in 1947. The paper production facilities were extensively modernized and expanded between 1966 and 1974, to keep pace with the demands of India's burgeoning post-Independence press, and a third, leading-edge, paper mill of the TPM group was developed in Choudwar, Orissa, but the third paper mill was later sold to Ballarpur Industries Ltd.
