== History ==
Troyan was named a town in 1868, when it developed as a craft center for the region. After the liberation it grows slowly. A spark in the town growth was the creation of a small water electrical plant and textile factories. In 1948, the town was connected to the railway Lovech – Levski – Svishtov. Later in time factories producing electrical motors, electrotechnical products, building machines, wool and furniture developed in the town.


== Culture ==
The Troyan region is home to the cultural and historical site of the Troyan Monastery. August 15 is the day of the Monastery's Patron Saint, when thousands of people from the country gather to celebrate and see a unique icon of Mary. The icon is unique in that Mary has three hands made of silver. The origins of the icon are unknown but there are many stories, some of which involve miracles.
The town is famous for its traditional pottery, probably developed partly as a result of the qualities of the local clay soil. Pottery was a main source of income for the local craftsmen during the Bulgarian Renaissance age. Now handmade pottery items are sold as souvenirs to tourists. Fine examples of traditional pottery can be seen in the town's museum, across from the municipal building.
Also notable are the Nunki Complex and the St Paraskeva Church, both built in the first half of the 19th century.
The production of premium quality plum brandy (rakia) has become a part of the local culture. In connection with this, the town holds the annual Festival of the Plum in the autumn. Plum brandy from Troyan has gained national and international acclaim at major showcases.
The official day of Troyan is October 14, the day of the town's patron saint, St Petka Paraskeva.
Troyan Peak in Tangra Mountains on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands is named after the town.
