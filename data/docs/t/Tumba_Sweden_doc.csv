Sven Tumba (born Sven Olof Gunnar Johansson; 28 August 1931 – 1 October 2011) was the most prominent Swedish ice hockey players of the 1950s and 1960s. He also represented Sweden in football as well as golf and became Swedish champion in waterskiing.Johansson first became known as "Tumba" in the 1950s since there were other players with the same last name, and he grew up in the Swedish town of Tumba. In October 1960 he married his wife Mona, and five years later he, along with Mona, legally changed his family name to Tumba.
After his retirement from ice hockey, he became an accomplished golfer, a golf course designer, creator and organizer of golf exhibitions and tournaments, as well as an ambassador to the game of golf, even officially introducing the game of golf to the former Soviet Union.

After a successful career in ice hockey and football, Tumba dedicated himself to golf as a player, golf course designer and ambassador of the sport. Tumba is widely recognized as an important, maybe the most important, person for introducing golf as a widely spread sport in Sweden.
Having been introduced to the game of golf for the very first time, being over the age of 30, he reached a scratch handicap in 1970, at 39 years of age, when he also won the Scandinavian International Amateur Match-play Championship (one of three major amateur tournaments in Scandinavia at the time) and was selected, as one of the four best amateur players in the country, to the Swedish national team at the 1970 Eisenhower Trophy in Madrid, Spain.
He turned professional the following year and in 1974, he qualified, as one of the two best professionals in the country, to represent Sweden in the 1974 World Cup in Caracas, Venezuela.
However, concerning golf in Sweden, he is not firstly remembered for his record as a player, but for his contributions to popularizing the game and putting Sweden on the map of the world of golf. He toured around in Sweden as the main attraction in inaugurations and anniversaries at golf clubs, showing his popular golf clinic, playing exhibition matches and drawing attention in media and among people, who not formerly did know about the game. His successful efforts to organize exhibitions in Sweden with Arnold Palmer in 1968 and Jack Nicklaus in 1969, was followed by the professional invitation tournament Volvo Open, which took place in Sweden in 1970 and 1971. In 1973 the Scandinavian Enterprise Open tournament was established, with Tumba as its founder, and it soon became one of the richest ones on the European Tour.
During the period of time for Tumbas golf career, the number of members in Swedish golf clubs increased 50 times, from around 12,000 at the beginning of the 1960s to approximately 600,000 in the middle of the 1990s.In 1985 he received The Merit Sign in Gold by the Swedish PGA. On the 100th anniversary of the Swedish Golf Federation in 2004, he was named the most influential person in the history of golf in that country, ahead of people such as all-time women's golf great Annika Sörenstam.Tumba also officially introduced the game of golf to the former Soviet Union.
