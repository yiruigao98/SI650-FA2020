The first people settled between 1912 and 1914 from Selepeng/Leshongwane in the north east part of the country. They were led by Kgosi Rauwe Sekoko who originated from Lehurutshe in Dinokaneng in South Africa.
Before settling in the north east it is understood that Bahurutshe first settled with Bangwato in the old Palapye and when Bangwato relocated to Serowe, they herded for the north east.
From the north east they were joined by some Bakalanga as they permanently settled in Tonota. The name of the tribe is originally Mohurutshe and Mokhurutshe was derived from the Kalanga name Ndikhurutshe.
Tonota like many other villages in Botswana, has many tribes living in it but the majority are Bakhurutshe who occupy the Tholo, Molebatsi, Maaloso, Maunya, Madisakwana and Mhakamme wards, and Bakalanga who live in the Manyanda ward. There are also Barotsi in Leomboko ward and BaShona(Zezuru) in Mandunyane. Most of the people from Tonota speak Sekhurutshe-SeNgwato (a language which is merely an inclusion of Kalanga-like words in SeNgwato) and Kalanga.
