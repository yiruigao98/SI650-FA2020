== Etymology ==
Shiz is the ancient name used during Persian Empire for Takab. Takab means one narrow water way in Persian language. Tak means one or alone and Ab means water. Takab was originally known as Tikan Təpə by its native Turkic Afshar people until 1941 when Iran's Academy of Persian Language and Literature officially changed it to Takab. Afshar people are one of the Oghuz Turkic peoples. These originally nomadic Oghuz tribes moved from Central Asia and initially settled in Iranian Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan republic, and Eastern Turkey. Later some of them were relocated by the Safavids to Khorasan and Mazandaran. Today, they are variously grouped as a branch of the Turkmens or the Azerbaijanis.
