== History ==
The area of modern Toba has been continuously inhabited since before the Jōmon period. During the Sengoku period, the area was under the control of pirates, from whom emerged Kuki Yoshitaka (from Nakiri district) as a dominant ruler. After having dominated the local seacoasts, he established Toba as his capital and built a castle there.  Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the castle became the center for Toba Domain.
In the Edo period, Toba flourished in trade and as a transshipment port between Osaka and Edo. The modern city of Toba was formed on November 1, 1954, by the merger of the town of Toba with five villages in Shima District.
