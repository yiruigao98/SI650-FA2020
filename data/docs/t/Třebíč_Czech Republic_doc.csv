Třebíč (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtr̝̊ɛbiːtʃ] (listen); German: Trebitsch) is a town in the Moravian part of the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. Třebíč is a regional centre with a population of approximately 36,000. It is the administrative capital of the Třebíč District.
In the age of its expansion, Třebíč was the third most important town in Moravia. The population growth started after World War II.
There are several well-known tourist sights in the town. The Jewish Quarter and St. Procopius Basilica are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The beginnings of the town's history are connected with the establishment of a Benedictine monastery, where the castle is located today.


== History and sights ==

The historical treasury of Třebíč includes the old Jewish Quarter and the large Romanesque St Procopius' Basilica, which incorporates some later Gothic features, including a rare example of a ten-part (also known as 'botanical') rose window. Such designs reflect the five or ten parts of the family Roseaceae flowers and fruit, based on their five sepals and petals or the usual ten segments of their fruit. Botanical rose windows contrast with more complex Gothic windows that contain more segments (usually multiples of traditional gothic units of design – three trefoil, or four quatrefoil). Another thesis says that these decorations are based on an ancient design, inspired by forerunners in the wheel of life, associated with eastern religions nowadays, or may allude to the Virgin Mary.
The famous Basilica originated in the early 12th century as a Benedictine monastery. It was endowed so well, that it led to the establishment of a local commercial centre; the town of Třebíč. The monastery was rebuilt during the reign of King Wenceslas I (1230–53), and again at the end of the fifteenth century. During the first half of the 16th century some of Třebíč's historic monastic buildings were remodeled into a castle, and were later renovated in Baroque style.
In the early eighteenth century changes were introduced on the basilica by the Czech architect Frantisek Maxmilian Kanka; windows were enlarged, buttresses were added, a southwest tower was rebuilt, and a new west front with two towers was constructed in a gothic baroque style.
The historical town of Třebíč, which extends on both sides of the river Jihlava, was declared a Conservation Area in 1990. The Jewish Quarter and St. Procopius Basilica together with the castle and gardens, are all included within the Trebic Conservation Area.
