Torremaggiore is a town, comune (municipality) and former seat of a bishopric, in the province of Foggia in the Apulia (in Italian: Puglia), region of southeast Italy.
It lies on a hill, 169 metres (554 ft) over the sea, and is famous for production of wine and olives.


== History ==
The history of Torremaggiore is strictly connected to that of the burg of (Castel) Fiorentino (di Puglia), a Byzantine frontier stronghold founded by the Italian catepan Basil Boioannes in 1018.

Later a Norman, Hohenstaufen, Angevine and finally Aragonese possession, it is especially remembered as the death place of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II on 13 December 1250.
Five years later the burg was attacked by Pope Alexander IV's troops, and the inhabitants fled to a nearby Benedictine abbey. Later they were allowed to found a new settlement, called Codacchio, later, when other refugees from Dragonara arrived, christened Terra Maioris ("Major Land"), the modern Torremaggiore. This burg was later a fief of the Counts (later Dukes) of Sangro. It was destroyed by an earthquake on July 30, 1627.
On 17 March 1862 a platoon of newly united Italy's royal troops was defeated by the brigands of Carmine Crocco; 21 soldiers were killed, even their captain Francesco Richard.
From 25 August 1925, Torremaggiore was connected to the nearby San Severo by a tramway, the first in southern Italy.


== Ecclesiastical history ==
Fiorentina was the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fiorentino, established in 1059. In 1391 it was suppressed and its territory merged into the Diocese of Lucera. The name Fiorentino (Florentinensis)  has been used, since 1969 as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric.
