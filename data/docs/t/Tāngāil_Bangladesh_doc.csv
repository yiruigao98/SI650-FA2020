Tangail (Bengali: টাঙ্গাইল, [ʈaŋgail]) (formerly the Arail city of Greater Mymensingh) is a major city of Dhaka Division in the central region of Bangladesh, 98 km north-west of Dhaka, the capital. It is the main urban area of the Tangail District. The city is situated on the bank of the Louhajang River. It is the 23rd largest city in Bangladesh.


== Etymology ==
During the early 19th century, horse carts were the main transportation medium for carrying goods and passengers in the present-day city area. This would lead to traffic made up of long lines of horse carts. Thus, many believe the name Tangail originated from the Bengali word tanga, meaning horse carts.


== History ==
Tangail has been a popular local business center since the early 19th century. In 1860, the central area of the Greater Mymensingh District was shifted from Atia due to the fertile land and high elevation near the Louhajong River. This caused the district's name to change to Tangail. The Municipal Corporation, or Paurasabha, was established on July 1, 1887. 


=== Wards ===
The Pourashava divided the city into five wards.

It was later redistricted into four wards:

Ward no. 1, as Central
Ward no. 2, as Betka
Ward no. 3, as Dighulia
Ward no. 4, as SantoshIn 1988, it was further subdivided into six wards:

Ward no. 1, as Central
Ward no. 2, as Betka
Ward no. 3, as Dighulia
Ward no. 4, as Santosh
Ward no. 5, as Zila Sadar
Ward no. 6, as KazipurIn 1999, the city was subdivided into 18 wards, its present organization.


=== Politics and Infrastructure ===
The first election of the city was held in November 1887. In that election, eight ward commissioners from four wards were elected by the direct vote of the citizens of the city. The Subdivision Commissioner of Tangail during that time, Shashi Shekhar Dutt, was appointed as the first administrator of Tangail city. The city was poorly developed, with a lack of paved roads and roadside lamps. Thus, the regional Zamindars and subdivision board provided financial support to dig ponds, lakes, and canals. Those sources served the local people with a safe water supply.In the early 1900s, the Pourashava authority installed kerosene roadside lamps. The Pourashava gradually became populated in the first half of the 20th century. At that time, many tube wells were set up in the town. The main modes of transportation were horsecars and cattle in the town.Electricity was established in the town in the early 1930s. In the 1960s, paved roads were constructed in the town, connecting the city to Dhaka. Bridges, culverts, and water supply were installed at this time.In 1985, Tangail City was promoted from a C Class city to a B Class city. In 1989, the Pourashava was promoted to A-Class. In the 1990s, the city was financed by the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Bangladesh to develop water supply, sanitation, wastewater drainage, bus terminals, supermarkets, and other infrastructure.

All important sports events in the city are held in Tangail Stadium, which is beside Bhashani Hall and Tangail Eidgah. The stadium has hosted national events.
