The following is an incomplete list of urban settlements, towns, new towns (satellite towns) in Hong Kong.
The Government of Hong Kong is unitary and does not define cities and towns as subsidiary administrative units. The limits of the City of Victoria, Kowloon and New Kowloon are stated in law, but none of these three areas has the legal status of a city or a town. Districts of Hong Kong are drawn according to mountains, coastlines and roads, and do not coincide with the natural extents of any urbanised areas.
