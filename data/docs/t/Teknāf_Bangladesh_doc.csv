The N1 or Dhaka–Chittagong Highway is a main transportation artery in Bangladesh, between Dhaka and Chittagong. Approximately 250 kilometres (160 miles) in length, the road links the country's two largest cities, Dhaka and Chittagong. The highway is known along various stretches as the Chittagong–Cox's Bazar Highway and the Cox's Bazar–Teknaf Highway. Currently two lanes with a four-lane expansion underway, the N1 is the busiest road in the country and a top development priority. Construction of a larger Dhaka-Chittagong expressway has been proposed to decrease traffic on the highway.


== Background ==
When constructed, the highway was limited to two lanes of traffic for most of its length. Traffic jams or tailbacks of 25 kilometres (16 miles) have been reported. In 2009, it was estimated that daily usage of the highway was 20,000–25,000 motorised vehicles, up 40% of which were trucks.The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) of the Ministry of Communication is expanding the Dhaka–Chittagong stretch to four lanes. The target to finish the project by December 2013, however implementation remains slow. The highway forms a critical component of the proposed Asian Highway Network route AH41 and the Central-South-East Asian economic corridor, including initiatives such as BCIM.


== Expansion ==

In January 2010, expansion of the highway from two lanes to four lanes started. The project will decrease the travel time from Dhaka to Chittagong to 4.5 or 5 hours.As of March 2013, only 23.5 per cent of work has been completed, and it was unlikely to meet its December 2013 deadline. Construction included 221 culverts, 22 bridges and three flyovers. Reza Construction Ltd. and Sino Hydro have set temporary camps for this purpose respectively near Daudkandi and Chandina.As of February 2015, the expected completion of the project was postponed until June 2015. And the project completed and opened on July 2, 2016.
