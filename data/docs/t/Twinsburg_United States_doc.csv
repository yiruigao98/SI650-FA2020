== History ==
In 1817 Ethan Alling, then aged 16, came to Township Five in the tenth range of the Connecticut Land Company, also known as Millsville. Alling was to survey the 400 acres (1.6 km2) of land his Connecticut family had purchased. He is considered the first settler of the town that would be renamed Twinsburg, and later he became the postmaster of the town, as well as a merchant, stagecoach operator, and hotel proprietor.
A pair of identical twins named Moses and Aaron Wilcox, from Killingworth, Connecticut, purchased some 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land in 1819. They sold tracts at low prices to attract other settlers. The twins offered 6 acres (24,000 m2) of land for a public square and twenty dollars to support the town's first school on the condition that the community would change its name from Millsville to Twinsburg. They shared a business and their property. Their wives were sisters who bore the same number of children to each twin. The twins died on the same day from the same disease, and are buried together in the Locust Grove Cemetery in Twinsburg.In 1963, the Twinsburg Historical Society was founded. It was housed in the building formerly occupied by the Twinsburg Institute (founded by Samuel Bissell and built in 1863). The museum run by the Historical Society holds pictures, papers and documents related to the area's history. Tools and artifacts used by early artisans and farmers, furniture, including domestic items, clothes, and books, as well as letters and records of Twinsburg's early days, are all showcased. The Mail Pouch Tobacco sign displayed on the barn was one of the last ones painted by the famous barn painter Harley Warrick.Twinsburg is served by the Twinsburg Public Library.
