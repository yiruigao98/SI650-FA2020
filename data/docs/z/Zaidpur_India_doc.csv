== History ==


=== Origin ===
Zaidpur was a Musalman military colony founded in 462 Hijri (1070 AD) by Abdullah Zar-baqsh, an immigrant from Qom, Persia. The settlement was named for Zar-Baksh's only son, Zaid (b. 462 Hijri (1070 AD)).
Zar-baqsh was a descendant of the prophet Muhammad through his daughter, Fatimah and her husband, Ali, and thus was of the Rizvi family, in the 14th generation from Muhammad. Zar-baqsh's father was Yaqoob and his grandfather was Ahmad (924–969 AD), a naqib (official investigator) of Qom.
The list below describes the descendants of Muhammad to Zaid, after whom Zaidpur was named.


=== Zar-baqsh ===
Zar-baqsh was born and raised in Qom. He later moved to Jajarm, now in current day North Khurasan, Iran. He was a scholar and a spiritual figure with miracles attributed to him. For example, under his spiritual power, gold fell from the sky, leading to his name "Zar-baqsh", the "one who gives gold". Due to persecution of the Saiyeds, (descendants of Muhammad), Zar-baqsh went to Lahore, Hindustan and from there, he travelled east, reaching a place in a forest, with a well, where he founded Zaidpur. This location was 9 miles (14 km) from the fort of Dawood Ghazi of Satrikh, an earlier immigrant, regional Muslim ruler, and a general of the sultan, Mahmood Ghaznavi.
Zar-baqsh married Bibi Yadgaar Bano, daughter of Dawood Ghazi. Dawood Ghazi's Mazaar (mausoleum), the Budhe Baba Ki Mazaar is in Satrikh, Barabanki district. Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud (1015–1032CE), the son of Dawood Ghazi and Sitr-e-Mu’alla (the sister of the Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi ), is entombed in Bahraich. Zar-basqh retired to a quiet spiritual life at the Dada Abdullah Ka Talaab well (known locally as the "Dada Dullan Ka Talab"). Later, a nearby village was founded and named Abdallahpur after Zar-baqsh.
In 1089CE, Zar-baqsh set out on a three-year-long, holy pilgrimage to Mecca. In 493 Hijri (1099CE), he left again. In 493 Hijri (1100CE), in Jajarm, in North Khorasan Province, Iran. Zar-baqsh died of an illness and is buried there.


=== Zaid ===
Zaid, the son of Zar-baqsh, was a saintly scholar to whom miracles have been attributed. At eighteen, he married Bibi Kaneez Bano, the daughter of Sulaiman of Satrikh for whom the town, Sulaimanabad is named. Sulaiman was the nephew of Dawood Ghazi.
Before Zar-baqsh left on his pilgrimage, he gave to his son, Zaid, the hereditary and traditional family lore. He also asked that his first born grandson be named Mahmood. The child was born in 1100 AD and a village near Zaidpur was named Mahmoodpur after the boy.
After the death of Zar-baqsh, Zaid retired to a life of solitude and devotion in the mohalla Gadhi-Qadeem in Zaidpur. Zaid died on 16th Rabi-us-Sani, 526 Hijri, 6 March 1132 AD at age 64 and was buried by his mother's side, near the Dada Abdullah Ka Talaab well on the outskirts of Zaidpur.
