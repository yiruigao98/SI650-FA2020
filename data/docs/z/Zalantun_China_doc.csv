Zalantun (Manchu J̌alan Ai"l or Jalan Tun) or Zhalantun (simplified Chinese: 扎兰屯; traditional Chinese: 扎蘭屯; pinyin: Zhālántún; Mongolian: ᠵᠠᠯᠠᠨ ᠠᠢ᠌ᠯ ᠬᠣᠲᠠ Жалан-Айл хот), is a city with an estimated population of 132,408 and administrative division of Hulunbuir Prefecture-level city, Inner Mongolia, China. It is in the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia, in the southeastern foothills of the Greater Khingan mountains, bordering Heilongjiang province to the east. It is an area which has a number of forests and streams, as well as the Yalu River, not to be confused with the Yalu River on the Sino-Korean border. It is known for its hunting and fishing.


== History ==

Zalantun was formerly known as Butha (布特哈; Bùtèhā), and the city was made into an administrative centre in the Kangxi era. In 1929, Buteha was renamed as Yalu county (雅鲁县; Yǎlǔ Xiàn) because the Yalu River runs through it, but in 1933 it became the Zalantun Banner (扎兰屯旗; Zhālántún Qí). In 1983, Zalantun ceased to be a banner and became a part of Hulunbuir, remaining so today.
