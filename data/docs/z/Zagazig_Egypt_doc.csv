== History ==
The city was found in the 19th century on a place of a village called Nazlat az-Zaqāzīq which was named after the Zaqzuq family. The family's name itself comes form a dialectal word zaqzuq or ziqziq which means "a small creature" (e.g. a fish or a mouse) and comes from a Coptic word ϫⲉⲕϫⲓⲕ "ant or other insect".The ruins of the ancient Egyptian city of Bubastis are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) southeast of town. Bubastis was the ancient capital of the 18th nome, and is home to the feast celebrating the cat goddess Bastet.
Bubastis is the Greek version of the Egyptian language name Pr-Bastet "House [Temple] of Bastet". Bubastis became the capital of Egypt in the 22nd and 23rd Dynasties. There are remains of the temples built by Osorkon II and Nectanebo II. Catacombs where the sacred cats were buried are located behind an Old Kingdom chapel remains that are from the period of Pepi I Meryre.
