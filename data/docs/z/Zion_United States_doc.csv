The city was founded in July 1901 by John Alexander Dowie (1847-1907), a Scots-Australian evangelical minister and faith healer who had immigrated to the United States in 1888. By 1890 he had settled in Chicago, where he built a large faith healing business (which included a large mail order component) and had attracted thousands of followers. 
He bought land 40 miles north of Chicago to found Zion, where he personally owned all the land and most businesses. The city was named after Mount Zion, Israel.Dowie also founded the Zion Tabernacle of the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church, which was the only church in town. The structure was built in the early 1900s and burned down in 1937, during the Great Depression.

=== Illinois Beach State Park ===
Zion is the closest municipality to South Beach within Illinois Beach State Park. The North Beach is in Winthrop Harbor. The beach was originally part of Camp Logan, developed in 1892 as a rifle range by the Illinois National Guard. In World War I and World War II, it served as a rifle range for the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. The range remained in operation until 1973, when it was transferred to the Illinois Department of Conservation.  
In 1950, the Illinois Dunes Preservation Society was established to maintain the natural qualities of the beach. With the help of the Illinois Department of Conservation, the area south of Beach Road was established as the state's first natural preserve. The sections of the northern beach, between Beach Road and the Wisconsin state border, were acquired by the state between 1971 and 1982.The Illinois Beach Resort and Conference Center is located at the south beach. The North Point Marina, one of the largest in the Great Lakes region, is at the north beach. It is Illinois' newest and largest marina.
On May 9, 2000, the area encompassing Illinois Beach State Park and North Point Marina was officially designated as the Cullerton Complex in honor of William J. Cullerton, Sr., a war hero, avid environmentalist, and long-time friend of conservation.

== Controversy ==

Until the 1940s, Zion enshrined the Flat Earth doctrine in its religious code.

The former city seal was the subject of a 1990 Federal Court case, because it featured a crown and scepter, a dove, a cross and the words “God Reigns”. The founder of Zion and designer of the city seal, John Alexander Dowie, intended for these to be Christian symbols and added them "for the purpose of the extension of the Kingdom of God upon earth ... where God shall rule in every department of family, industry, commercial, educational, ecclesiastical and political life." The court ruled the city could not use these religious symbols in its seals and emblems. While the Christian symbolism was removed, the phrase  “In God We Trust” could be used on the new city seal since it was already acceptable religious language in the public arena.
