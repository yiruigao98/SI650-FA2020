Zlatan (Serbian Cyrillic: Златан) is a male given name of Slavic origin meaning Golden. The name is common amongst all South Slavic countries, namely in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia and Serbia. The name is found in particularly high frequencies in Bosnia because it is considered ethnically neutral amongst the three dominant Bosnian ethnicities: Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats. The name is derived from the South Slavic word zlato - from the Old Slavic root zolto (gold).
