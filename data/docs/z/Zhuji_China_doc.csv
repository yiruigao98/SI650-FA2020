The region around Zhuji has been settled since Neolithic times and was the origin of the Wuyue culture. During the Spring and Autumn period, it was the birthplace of the legendary beauty Xi Shi. After the state of Yue was absorbed into the unification of China, Qin Shi Huang formally codified the boundaries of Zhuji as a county in 222 BC. This status remained intact until 1989, when the State Council reclassified Zhuji as a city.
