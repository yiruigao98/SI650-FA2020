The philosopher Mencius was born in Zoucheng, then within the feudal State of Zou. His descendants lived in Zoucheng all the way to the present. Some of them migrated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. In the present day, there are four major sites in the city relating to Mencius: the Mencius Temple (simplified Chinese: 孟庙; traditional Chinese: 孟廟; pinyin: Mèng Miào), the Mencius Family Mansion (孟府; Mèng Fǔ), the Mencius Forest (孟林; Mèng Lín, 35°28′42.27″N 117°2′56.11″E), and Mencius' Mother's Forest (孟母林; Mèng Mǔ Lín, 35°29′29.97″N 116°58′49.09″E).
The Mencius Temple, which covers an area of more than 4 hectares (9.9 acres) on the south side of town, has five courtyards and sixty-four halls and rooms.

The Mencius Mansion, where his descendants lived, is adjacent to the temple, and has 116 halls and rooms.According to the management of the Mencius Temple, the temple grounds house over 270 stone steles and sculptures, some of which dating from as early as the Song dynasty.
