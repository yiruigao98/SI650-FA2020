Water towns, also called Canal towns (水乡), are certain ancient and historic towns in China known for their bridges, rivers, and canals.  Such towns exist in many regions in China, although those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are often the most renowned.
Fan et al write: "Geographically, water towns are concentrated in the Jiangnan area, including the present Jiangsu province, Zhejiang province and Shanghai area, to the south of the Yangtze River... These river-based settlements appeal to tourists for two main reasons: first, the historic and cultural heritage in the ancient towns is very attractive; and second, the atmosphere of the water towns represents harmony between nature and its residents. In particular, the idyllic small-town setting enables urban residents to escape from the noise, pollution and pressures of cities".Some cities in the Jiangnan area such as Suzhou and Shaoxing have also long been famous for its canals and bridges, they itself, however, can not be classified as "towns" as they fall to a larger "city" category.
