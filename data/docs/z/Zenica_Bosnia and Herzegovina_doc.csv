Zenica ( ZEN-it-sə; Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic: Зеница; Bosnian: [zěnitsa] (listen)), is a city and an administrative and economic center of the Zenica-Doboj Canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located in the valley of river Bosna, about 70 km (43 mi) north of the country's capital Sarajevo. The city is known for Zenica Ironworks and the second heavy industry but also as a significant university center. According to the final results of 2013 population census in BiH, the settlement of Zenica itself counts 70,553 citizens and the administrative area 110,663.The urban part of today's city is formed in several phases, including Neolithic, Illyrian, Roman Municipium Bistua Nuova (2nd–4th century; old name of the city) with early Christian dual basilica. Traces of an ancient settlement have been found here as well; villa rustica, thermae, a temple and other buildings were present too. Earliest findings in the place date from the period 3,000–2,000 B.C.; they were found on the localities of Drivuša and Gradišće. Zenica's current name was first mentioned on the 20 March 1436. Medieval church has been unearthed in Zenica, as well as Franciscan Monastery of St. Mary. Time of the independence of the Medieval Bosnia is directly connected to Zenica (Gradješa's plate and abdication act; Kulin ban's time; Vranduk, a castle of the Bosnian kings; Janjići and 'hižas' [homes] of the Bosnian Church members; stećci, stone tombstone monuments etc.). During the Ottoman rule (1463–1878), Zenica became a Muslim town (kasaba); at the very end of the 17th century, Zenica had 2,000 citizens, mostly Muslims; Orthodox and Catholic Christians get mentioned again from the end of the 18th century, and Jews in the 19th century. Zenica has been mostly built in the Austro-Hungarian and Yugoslavian periods. Number of citizens has been rising rapidly during the 20th century, and from the Bosnian War until 2013 city lost a quarter of its population. Municipality of Zenica became the City of Zenica in 2014.
The city is geographically located in the heart of Bosnia. The area of the settled place is 43.01 km2 (16.61 sq mi) and of the city, 558.5 km2 (215.6 sq mi). The relief is valley-basin and the elevation 310–350 m (1,017–1,148 ft). Rivers Bosna, Lašva, Babina and Kočeva flow through the city itself. A moderate continental climate prevails. The city has 13 urban local settlements and the City consists of total 81 spread rural settlements.
The city has nine national monuments. The football club Čelik is a landmark of Zenica, as is one of the tallest buildings on the Balkans – Lamela. Some of the most famous Zeničans are Semir Osmanagić, Anabela Basalo, Danis Tanović, Amar Jašarspahić Gile, Mladen Krstajić, Dejan Lovren, Mervana Jugić-Salkić and Amel Tuka.


== Etymology ==
According to tradition, the city is named after the pupil of the eye (ekavian Serbo-Croatian: zenica – pupil).
The legend of the name is connected to the saddest period of the medieval Bosnian state:  The fall of the Bosnia Kingdom to the Ottomans in 1463. According to the Croatian folk story, Zenica's name commemorates Queen Katarina Kosača Kotromanić's words as she left Bobovac, "My pupil is left behind!" (Serbo-Croatian: Osta moja z[j]enica!)Because of its location in the center of Zenica field, the city is indeed analogous to the eye pupil.Name of the city can also be derived from the word zenit, because the city is in the center (zenith) of the Bosnia and Herzegovina i.e. Bosnia.


== History ==

The urban part of the today's Zenica formed through several determined phases which chronologically include the time of Neolithic community, Illyrian 'gradina', Roman Municipium Bistua Nuova, the most important founding (2nd–4th century) in which the monumental early Christian basilica is mostly present, besides which only one other is identified in the Europe.
In the city Zenica's settlement of Bilimišće, traces of ancient settlement were found; in the City of Zenica's villages Putovići and Tišina, where villa rustica dominates, thermae, temple and a series of other following objects are present, too.


=== Prehistory ===
Earliest findings in the Zenica place date from the period 3,000 B.C. to 2,000 B.C.; they were found on the localities of Drivuša and Gradišće. The following findings are from the Metal Age in Orahovički stream near Nemila, Gračanica, Ravna and other places; metal axes, arrows, ornamental fibulae and ceramic remains were unearthed here.Illyrians came to this region on the transition from Bronze to Iron Age (from 6th to 5th century B.C.). Their defensive buildings 'gradinas' are the most famous (the name came from the verb – Serbo-Croatian: graditi – to build).The urban part of today's Zenica has already formed in the younger Stone Age – Neolithic, and especially later in the time of Illyrians – today, toponyms of their 'gradinas' are proof for that; Gradišće, Gračanica, Gradac. That is how the royal city of Vranduk probably existed in the time of Illyrians, under the name Arduba.There is a dilemma on the presence of the Illyrian tribe Desitiates in Zenica region. Solution are direct proofs from toponomastic material – such as toponym gradina which survived until today in the names of the mentioned settlements Gradac, Gradišće and Gračanica.Recent (August 2019) international archaeological research, conducted by the Vienna (Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology), Zenica (Zenica museum) and Sarajevo students and scientists using modern technology, shows that settlements with people and animals were near Zenica over 3,100 years ago. Skeletons of pigs, cattle, and goats were found in Kopilo, an elevated place (600 m a.s.l.), indicating that humans (farmers) then lived there; two tombs (one with human bones and ceramics), two tumuli and a completely new prehistorical settlement 'Ravna gradina' were found, too.


=== Old Age ===
Romans have conquered these parts from the very end of the 3rd century B.C. Bellum Batonianum from 6th to 9th century was present in this area too. The Romans ruled continuously until the end of the 4th century. Roman authority did not remove settlements in the Illyrian 'gradinas'.Today's area of Zenica had its peak in the first six centuries of the new era, when in parts of today's Zenica – aside from Bistua Vetus (Barbarians' village in Rama) and Delminium (Duvanjsko Field) – one of the three most important municipiums and centers of Christian dioceses in Bosnia has been found: Bistua Nuova – seat of the Bistuenska diocese, the seat of Catholicism in the Bosnian area prior to the Slavs' arrival. Information that Bistua Nuova's bishop Andrew (Andreas, Andrija) took part in and was a signer of Solin sinodas in 530 and 533 underlines its importance. Ancient tombstone monuments are from ancient Bistua Nuova, as well as remains of old Christian basilica, etc. In the urban settlement of Odmut, and rural settlements of Putovići and Tišina, archaeologists found various findings; epigraphs stand out by their importance, which guided them towards conclusion that Bistua Nuova was in the Zenica area. It is not excluded that Bistua Nuova was right at the place of today's Zenica.An important road towards Salona (Solin), Argentarium (Srebrenica) and Sirmium (Srijemska Mitrovica) was passing through Bistua Nuova.Barbarian invasions from the north stopped civilization continuity and shortly forced Christianity to retreat from these areas. During the invasions at the beginning of the 7th century Bistua Nuova was destroyed, along with its basilica. Four centuries of emptiness in the wells follow after the retreat of Christianity.
It is believed that Barbarian invasions destroyed a huge part of ancient inheritance. Goths, Avars and Slavs passed through this location. After their invasions almost one century was needed for first the Slav countries to form.


=== Medieval Bosnia ===

History on Medieval Zenica of 13th and 14th centuries is very insufficient. There is but a single item of evidence from 1244 about Croatian-Hungarian king Béla IV's charter. According to the documents that have been studied until so far, the city's current name was first mentioned on 20 March 1436, and later – Zenica is mentioned in a series of documents related to Republic of Ragusa (Republic of Dubrovačka).In the period of Middle Ages, in 1370 more precisely, settlement Klopče was mentioned, as well as family of that name; on 8 January 1404, the Bosnian bishop from Janjići sent dispatches to the Ragusan prince Vlaho Sorkočević. In the Zenica settlement of Varošište, a medieval church has been unearthed and Franciscan monastery of St. Mary, which was built by sculptor Ivan Hrelić, a student of Juraj Dalmatinac.Time of the political independence of the Middle Ages Bosnia is directly connected to Zenica, before all with Gradješa's plate and act of abjuration, by which Kulin ban's time was continued and it denotes facts of political power, too. Near the fortified city of Vranduk, the seat of Bosnian kings, Janjići and homes of the bishops of the Bosnian Church, with stećci in Puhovac and Pojske, several scribes and builders – among other – are the facts and proofs of a special significance of this place in the Middle Ages. Also with its names (Bistua Nuova, Bilino polje, Brod), and Zenica after 20 March 1436, this city is tied for central part of the country and river Bosna.


=== Ottoman era ===

In the times of Ottoman rule (1463–1878), the change of the direction of the main trade route in turn changed the city and except for a short period when it was a seat of Brod judge 'kadija' (until 1557) Zenica was a kasaba (small town), again with characteristic lookalike made by several mosques (Sultan Ahmedova, also known as Čaršijska Mosque; Osman-Ćelebijina; Sejmenska; Jalijska), Madrasah (1737), several maktabs, various nishans (a type of Bosnian Muslim gravestone), shadirvans, inns, caravansaries, etc.In one description from 1697 Zenica is discussed – where melons grow successfully "and whole place is very tame". According to the presumptions, Zenica had 2,000 citizens, among which Muslims dominated; at the end of 18th century Orthodox and Catholic Christians are mentioned again, and in 19th century Jews.After ruination and exodus after the intrusion of Eugene of Savoy in 1697, time of stabilization begins for Zenica, and in administrative, urban, business and topographic sense Zenica čaršija stands out with its characteristic marks.


=== Austro-Hungarian era ===
After the Berlin Congress, held in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was given the rights to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina; armed resistance to occupying troops soon arose. It is believed that exactly Zenica, more precisely the Hadži Mazića house, was the place of negotiations between the representatives of the Ottoman authorities in the Bosnian vilayet, Hafiz-pasha and the commander of the Austro-Hungarian occupying forces, General Filipović, on the conditions of the cessation of the conflict.

Capital objects of wider social-economic importance were built; they became important for Zenica. They include the railway from Bosanski Brod to Zenica (1879), the coal mine (1880), the paper factory (1885), the ironworks (1892), and the penitentiary (1886). In 1908 a power station was built in Zenica, which enabled the introduction of electric public lighting. State schools were also opened, the first in 1885, and the second in 1910; in this period in Zenica there were also confessional schools, one for the Catholic and Orthodox churches, and for three maktabs, madrasahs and rozdios ('ruždija'); Muhamed Seid Serdarević, the muallim in the Sultan Ahmed Madrasah in Zenica, advocated for the reform of the teaching, where the lectures began to be conducted in the local language and the program modernized in accordance with the requirements of the time. Cultural societies were organized, on a strictly national-confessional basis, such as the Croatian Singing Society, Zvečaj, the Czech Word and others; at the same time, other societies of general character are established, such as firefighters, hunters, mountaineers and others. In 1910 the first cinema, called Helios, was opened in Zenica, which raised the city culture to a new level. This will, aside from other things, cause a series of changes – both qualitative and quantitative shifts in the city's development.


=== End of the 19th century; 20th century ===

By the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century, urbanization was underway and the number of citizens increased several fold, according to the 1910 census in this place there were 7,215 men and women. The rapid growth was reflected by a construction boom:  Orthodox Church of the Nativity of Our Lady in 1885, two Catholic churches in 1910, a synagogue in 1903 and several lodgings for the night, hotels, schools, water supply, and modern roads.After World War I, the Kingdom of SHS was formed, which in 1929 became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia; Bosnia and Herzegovina belonged to these countries. The political, economic and social life of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1918 to 1941 stagnated, although the situation changed slightly before the beginning of World War II, when certain investments in Ironworks Zenica came.20th century in Zenica is generally marked with series of different characteristic phenomena, increased industrialization, especially after 1938 with Harsh railway (Gruba pruga) being built, the pauperization of the part of the citizenry, its proletarization, as well as mixing of advanced urban European and still domestic Bosnian mentality and habits.Specific-functions-and-purposes city develops, especially bordered with two facts – Penitentiary and Ironworks Zenica – but also precious confirmation of the coexistence of the Zenicans with different histories; the stone bridge has connected house of Kosta Jefić and Osmanaga Mehmedić, and Jewish Havra, for over 90 years.


==== Yugoslavia ====
In the period between 1941 and 1945, domestic people (mostly Muslims, by declaration of the famous Resolution of Zenica Muslims from May 1942) show evident effort to retain respect and consideration as well as protection of bare life from non-Muslims, through formation of their authentic sign, Muslim militias – in Šerići, Doglodi, Babino –, and through partisan units, what gave and had certain demands and weight.It was a dimension of Zenica way to have anti-fascist resistance; this city had no major destruction, terror and victims. The dimension of the anti-fascist struggle were determined by their nationalist) ideology – which surfaced during the war and declined after the war.After liberation of Zenica achieved by partisans on 12 April 1945 (Zenica Liberation Day), the city started to grow rapidly – as a quickly developed industrial center. It expanded and included the former villages of Bilino Polje, Klopče and Radakovo; new flat blocks were built for more numerous coalminers and workers in the steelworks. Number of citizens in 1948 was only about 15,000, and by 1961 it grew up to over 30,000; in year 1981, there was over 63,000 citizens in Zenica, and after the last Yugoslavian census made in Yugoslavia – Zenica was city with over 96,000 citizens. For the time of the Yugoslavian period, which has lasted for about 50 years, the population increased sixfold.


==== Bosnian War ====

One year before the outbreak of the Bosnian War, in 1991, Zenica became the seat of one of the first private and independent radio stations in Eastern Europe – Radio CD-CEMP. In the spring of 1993, journalist and owner of the Radio CD-CEMP, won a Belgian accolade for independent journalism – "The Pen Of Peace".

The first civilian casualty of the Bosnian War in Zenica was two-year-old Matea Jurić, who was killed by a gunshot during the blockade of the Yugoslav People's Army barracks in the urban settlement of Bilimišće.On 19 April 1993, during the Croat–Bosniak War, 16 civilians were killed and 50 injured when the Croatian Defence Council shelled Zenica's central bazaar. The shells was fired from the village of Putićevo, 15 km (9.3 mi) away. A total of six shells struck the bazaar. During this period Zenica was isolated from the rest of the world for a year and a half. The city suffered significant loss of the civic society from sniper fire, arson and hunger, and had neither water nor electricity.During the war, an economic meeting ZEPS was still organized.Zenica's populace changed much during the war, with the arrival of Muslims (today's Bosniaks) from other parts of BiH and the departure of Serbs to areas under Serb control.

=== 21st century ===
Zenica recovers from the war and continues to slowly progress. The ruling party in the City of Zenica for 20 years was the majority Bosniak and Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA), for which i.e. time of its mayors the development of Zenica (its urban core but also other villages as the part of then Municipality) advanced slowly, partly because of corruption and various types of misappropriation; many areas of the populated place itself did not get city lights, water supply and canalization and solidly asphalted roads even after 20 years.The drastic population decrease was seen from 1991 to 2013 and it is ≈26% (Zenica lost one quarter of its citizens, partly because of the War, partly because of unfavorable economic circumstances in BiH and recessions prompting young and middle-aged residents to emigrate to Europe and America).

In 2014, Zenica – as well as other FBiH cities – saw violent citizen protests. The Municipality Building was smashed, RMK buildings also demolished, tens of people taken to the cantonal hospital and some officials resigned.Municipality of Zenica was recategorised on 20 November 2014 as the City of Zenica.2016 Bosnian-Herzegovinian municipal elections made independent politician (Fuad Kasumović) a Zenica mayor for the first time in the recent city history; he planned to make the city a modern, European and regional center. During the three years of his term he accelerated development, focused on the city's core i.e. settled place Zenica; for the locations of priority importance, the city introduced city lights and water supply with canalization, road asphalting and transport improvement (bicycle lanes and stands for bicycles were introduced for the first time in Zenica's history on a mass scale, and since October 2019 also nextbike system which 200 cities in the world have, but in BiH only Sarajevo, Banja Luka and Zenica have), plans for introducing a new heating system for the city are being made (Zenicans regularly face total turnoff or weak output of heating during the season, especially when it is coldest), New Year's concerts began to be held on the main city square open for all citizens and visitors (the first one was in 2017/18 with Miligram making the show; the second was in 2018/19 with Crvena jabuka) as the main act, various new manifestations are organized for citizens and tourists (e.g. Zenica summer fest, music festival with domestic and regional stars that lasts for several weeks and takes place on the city square – the first was opened by Frenkie in the summer of 2018 and closed by Dubioza Kolektiv, and Saša Kovačević opened the second in summer of 2019 and Željko Joksimović closed it; artistic, trade and other bazaars and the like) while the trade-economic fair with a long history ZEPS expands – thus improving tourist i.e. economic potential. These are all reasons because of which city has more visitors from all continents, of which it is significant to mention Africa and Asia. The issue of stray dogs in the urban core was handled, pollution that culminated at the beginning and in the mid-2010s was reduced significantly (Zenicans were used to pink-red sky and stinky, polluted air especially during the nights of pollution), public transport was improved (new buses, wi-fi etc.)... There are plans to resolve a huge problem of unemployment and to modernize the education system, build city underground garage, as well as projects of warming the public city flat buildings with styrofoam facades. Manifestation Čimburijada (Bosnian: čimbur – the local name for the scrambled eggs dish çılbır), that have been present for several decades in Zenica, took place in 2019, too, with video-broadcast on TV Zenica.

=== Ecology ===

Zenica's industry polluted and damaged the environment. After the Bosnian War, the main culprit for hard ecological state in Zenica, ironworks (today mostly converted into Arcelor Mittal, owned by Lakshmi Mittal), was incapacitated. However, a few years ago, the old steelworks partially resumed its operations, so because of these and other reasons the non-partisan, citizen organisation "Eko pokret Zenica" was founded in Zenica, and later the Greens of Bosnia and Herzegovina political party as well – with their seat in Zenica. In the city there is also "Eko-forum Zenica" as an acting organization.The Babina river basin was declared a nature park after their intercession. There are initiatives to create a dam on the Vranduk, what would cause ecological catastrophe. The Greens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and "Eko pokret" as well, are against this and advocate declaring Vranduk a national park.The regional depony [waste landfill] "Mošćanica" (RDM) d.o.o. Zenica is located between Mošćanica, Mutnica, Palinovići, Briznik, Arnauti, Ponihovo and Plavčići villages, southeast of Zenica city; it collects all waste from Zenica and its vicinity; the Zenica waste management company – which moves garbage to "Mošćanica" and curates city parks, streets, etc. – is the German company Alba d.o.o.
