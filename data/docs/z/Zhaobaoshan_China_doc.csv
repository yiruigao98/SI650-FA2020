This list of bridges in China is organized by province and includes notable bridges. China has a long history in bridge construction. The oldest bridge still in existence in China is the Anji Bridge, constructed during the years between 595 and 605.
During the infrastructure boom of the past two decades, bridge-building has proceeded at a rapid pace on a vast scale. Prior to the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River, China's longest, from Yibin to Shanghai, and all overland roads and railways crossing this 2,884 km (1,792 mi.) stretch of the river had to be ferried. There were only seven such bridges in 1992, but that number reached 73 by the end of 2012, including eight new openings in that year alone.
China has been pushing the boundaries of bridge construction with many record breaking bridges, including: 

The Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge, the world's longest bridge measuring over 164 kilometres (102 mi)
The Xihoumen Bridge in Zhejiang province, the second-longest suspension bridge span
The Sutong Bridge in Jiangsu province, the second-longest cable-stayed span
The Sidu River Bridge, the highest bridge in the world
Chaotianmen Bridge, the longest arch bridge span
