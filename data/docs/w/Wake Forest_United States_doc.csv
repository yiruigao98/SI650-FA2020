== History ==
In 1832, Dr. Calvin Jones, originally from New England, bought 615 acres (2.49 km2) of forested land in Wake County, North Carolina.  The sparsely populated area became known as the Forest of Wake, or Wake Forest.  Jones sold his farm to the North Carolina Baptist Convention for $2,000, who opened the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute, later Wake Forest College, on the site.  The Raleigh & Gaston Railroad, completed in 1840, established a depot in nearby Forestville that stimulated the school and surrounding village.  College leaders convinced the railroad to move the depot even closer to the college in 1874, leading to more economic development.  This community was incorporated as the "Town of Wake Forest College" in 1880.  In 1909, the word "College" was removed from the name of the town.  The college moved to the much larger city of Winston-Salem in 1956. Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary began offering classes on the original campus of Wake Forest University in 1950, and occupied the entire campus when the university completed its move.
