Werdau is a town in Germany, part of the Landkreis Zwickau in the Free State of Saxony. It is situated on the river Pleiße, 8 km from Zwickau.
The town was mentioned as early as 1304, and in 1398 it was purchased by Frederick, then margrave of Meissen, who afterwards became Elector of Saxony.In 1905, the city held a contest for the design of a new town hall (see right), as the old one built in 1727 had become too small. The tower and floorplan of one design was combined with the façade of another, and ground was broken for construction on August 1, 1908. It was inaugurated on April 26, 1911, with Frederick Augustus III of Saxony in attendance.Werdau station is located on the Leipzig–Hof railway.
