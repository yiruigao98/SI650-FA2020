Wai (pronunciation ) is a town in Sātārā District, in Mahārāshtra state, India.
Located on the Krishna River, Wai was a town of some prominence in the days of the Peshwas. Two important Maratha Brahmin from ruling families had their origins here: Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi (Tambe family) and Gopikabai, wife of Nanasaheb Peshwa (Raste family). Peshwas, a word derived from the Persian word for "foremost leader," were similar to a modern prime minister, and served Maharashatra state from 1713 to 1857.Wai has long been a cultural center. Locally prominent families such as the Raste, Ranade, Phadnavis etc. built several architecturally significant temples in Wai. A few kilometers from Wai on a hill 4,650 feet above sea level is the temple of Mandhradevi Kalubai, which is more than 400 years old. In more recent times, some 300 Bollywood and Marathi movies have been filmed in Wai.
