== Geography ==
Wadern is located at the foot of the Schwarzwälder Hochwald


== History ==
Stone tools and different grave-mounds in the so-called "Hochwald" region are  evidence for the city's existence in a time where there were no written sources ever found (Prehistory). In connection with the conquest by the Romans (58-51/50 B.C.) first written reports were discovered. Gaius Julius Caesar, the Roman general, created a detailed and written description of the people who were living in this area of Germany at this time with a comment about their rites and customs.
This part of Germany's economy and culture benefitted from the improvements of the traffic infrastructure, which was constructed by the Romans; because of this extension and progress the Celtic population increased.
The first decades after Christ were struck by increased collapsing Germanic tribes, what eventually lead to the dissolution of the Roman Empire as well as to this region being integrated into France.
Agricultural and housing development in the Hochwald were able to extend since there was unused land available to spread out on. In the Middle Ages a lot of clearance was done, which resulted in the most common name endings: -bach, -feld and -rod of the towns around this area. What is now the city of Wadern used to belong to various territories, for example to the Erzstift Trier, Dukedom Lothringen or to the governance of Dagstuhl. Especially the governance of Dagstuhl took the main role in the development of downtown Wadern. In 1680 this south-western part of Germany was governed by the counts of Oettingen - Baldern, count Joseph Anton of Oettingen - Baldern and Soetern took over the governance of Dagstuhl in the 18th century.
He moved his residence and his royal household completely to Dagstuhl and resided in his castle built in 1760. With his engagement and expertise he succeeded in improving the economic situation in Dagstuhl. The conferment issued in 1765 of the market right contributed as the most important renewal for Wadern. The then created marketplace and the established market fountain are even today visible signs of this market right.
With indenting French revolutionary troops the feudalism was dissolved and the possession went over to French state possession, thus also castle Dagstuhl which baron Wilhelm Albert de Lasalle took over from Luisenthal in 1807. Castle Münchweiler was bought back in 1801 by his former owner again.
The current city became a French state area in 1801, then got within the scape of the territorial reorganisation by the Wiener congress in 1815 under Prussian management.
By the production of the new outlets for the Saarland coal the number of the people from the Hochwald who were occupied in the mining, grew since the middle of the 19th century. Agriculture was often pursued as a supplementary income. In addition, the connection of the current city with the railroad network led to an economic impetus which also affected the small crafts enterprises positively.

According to the present documents the castle was built before 1290 by Knight Boemund von Saarbrücken as an outpost of the rule of the bishop of Trier. The plant is a motte and shows with its baily castle and its bastions a length over 300 meters. After the extinction of the lords of the castle in the 14. century the power disintegrated into the heirs of Fleckenstein, Brucken, Rollingen and Kriechingen, who managed the castle alternately. The plant became subsequently took down by Wolfgang Anton von Langenmantel the administrator of Dompropst and later by archbishop and elector of Trier, Franz Goerg von Schönborn. Since the mid-80s the remains of the castle were exposed and saved. Because of redevelopment measures between 2002 and 2006 a historical path is achievable by two bridges. The didactic processing of information boards and presentations on the internet finished the work.


=== Palace and chapel of Dagstuhl ===
The palace of Dagstuhl was the former domicile of count Joseph Anton von Oettingen-Sötern. He let this palace built between 1760 and 1762 and in 1775 it was widened. While the French revolution the count escaped and so in 1806 the family of Lasalle von Louisenthal took the building. To get a spatial link between the living space and the chapel new extension were built in 1906. Ceiling and walls  were painted by Octavie de Lasalle. She laid them out with biblical historical paintings. In the extension of the chapel there is a painted way of cross by her, which originally comes from the church of Lockweiler. Until  1957 the palace was property of the family. After that, it was an old people's home for many years. Today the renowned Leibniz-Zentrum for computer science works in it.
A castle garden, which was put on within the scope of the project Gärten ohne Grenzen belongs to the palace. Many creation signs of the garden decrease to suggestions of the "painter's countess" Octavie de Lasalle, who had documented her images in different garden paintings.

The castle has also a baroque-garden. This shape is unique in Saarland and today it is used as a hotel and a café.


=== Castle of Counts Wadern ===
In 1758 count Joseph Anton von Oettingen-Sötern built the first of his three castles, Castle of Counts, in the Oberstraße in Wadern. A former building at this place was mainly used for the counts administration. It was used as magistrate's court head office from 1827 to 1959 with interruptions. The building was used by the Hochwald Gymnasium from 1959 to 1961 until their new building was ready. Today the last part is used as a part of the town hall. It is a plain building from the late Baroque era, divides by five axis with a steep hipped roof and five dormers. The original stairwell with a wooden railing and a pattern like a chain is still inside of today's town hall.


=== Oettinger Schlösschen Wadern ===

After the period of the counts, first the castle was used as a restaurant, after that as a pharmacy. At the exterior wall, visitors can find the Waderner Elle, a special measure which drapers and leather-merchants had to use at the markets. Just before the planned demolition, local geographers and historians saved it. Today, it accommodates the town museum and the council hall.
