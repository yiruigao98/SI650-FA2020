The total population of the city was 27,592 at the time of the 2010 census.


== History ==

The city of Winona began on the site of a Native American village named Keoxa.  The seat of the Wapasha dynasty, Keoxa was home to a Mdewakanton band of the eastern Sioux.
Non-Native Americans settled the area in 1851 and laid out the town into lots in 1852 and 1853.  The original settlers were Yankee immigrants from New England.   The population increased from 815 in December, 1855, to 3,000 in December, 1856.  In 1856 German immigrants arrived as well.  The Germans and the Yankees worked together planting trees and building businesses based on lumber, wheat, steamboating and railroads. Between 1859 and 1900, some 5,000 Poles and closely related Kashubians emigrated to Winona, making up one quarter of the population. Since 80% of them were Kashubians, Winona became known as the "Kashubian Capital of America". As a result of the influx of Polish Catholic immigrants, the Church of St. Stanislaus (now Basilica of St. Stanislaus Kostka) was built. For a time, Winona had more millionaires than any other city of its size in the United States.The railroad and steamboat transportation industries helped Winona grow into a small city that diversified into wheat milling, and lumber production. In 1856, more than 1,300 steamboats stopped at Winona. The Winona and St. Peter Railroad first segment of 11 miles (18 km) from Winona to Stockton, Minnesota was completed by the end of 1862. Winona then had the second operational railroad in Minnesota, after the St. Paul and Pacific Line from Saint Paul to St. Anthony Falls. In December 1870, the Mississippi River was bridged at Winona by the Winona Rail Bridge. In 1892, a wagon toll-bridge over the Mississippi, a steel high-bridge, was completed and remained in service until the opening of the Main Channel Bridge in 1942.
Winona has two historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places that combine into a single local historic district administered by the city's Heritage Preservation Commission.
A bandshell was completed in 1924 for outdoor musical performances and events. The Winona Municipal Bands holds concerts there during the summer.
