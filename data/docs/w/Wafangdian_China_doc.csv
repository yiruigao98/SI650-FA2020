== Climate ==
Wafangdian has a four-season, monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (Köppen Dwa), with long, cold, windy but dry winters, and humid and very warm summers. The area experiences a seasonal delay due to the influence of the nearby ocean, which also helps temper the summers. In winter, as the Liaodong Bay is typically frozen north of the urban area of Dalian, the moderating effects of that body of water are minimised, as the Siberian high often causes winds to blow from the northwest: the monthly daily average temperature in January is −7.1 °C (19.2 °F), as compared to −3.9 °C (25.0 °F) in downtown Dalian. For Wafangdian, the same figure in July is 23.8 °C (74.8 °F). The annual mean temperature is 9.59 °C (49.3 °F). Close to half of the annual precipitation falls in July and August alone.
