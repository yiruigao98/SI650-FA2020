== Language ==
Like the majority of areas in Zhejiang, most people from Wenling speak a dialect of Wu Chinese, known as Wenling Hua. It is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin Chinese, and partially intelligible with (also Wu) Shanghainese. There is also a small portion of Min Nan speakers in the southeastern regions, especially in Shitang Town. The linguistic diversity of some regions has resulted in a segment of the population becoming fluent in speaking up to three languages, when Mandarin is included.


== History ==
During the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, Wenling was not part of the Chinese state but rather part of the separate culture of Dong'ou. Following the 3rd-century BC conquests of the Qin Empire, it was incorporated into the Minzhong Prefecture before being moved to Kuaiji under the Han. From the Tang to the Ming, Wenling was divided between Taizhou's Huangyan District and Wenzhou's Yueqing District.
In 1469, Taiping County was formed in the area from Fangyan, Taiping, and Fanchang, three villages formerly incorporated into Huangyan. Yueqing County's Shanmen and Yuhuan villages were ceded in 1476.
In 1513, the county seat built 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) of city wall, roughly squared, giving it the name of "Square Castle".
In 1914, the county was renamed Wenling to distinguish it from counties with same name in Shanxi, Sichuan, and Anhui. Wenling ("warm mountain") was once another name of Wenqiao Town.
Wenling was conquered by Communist forces on May 28, 1949, and the county government was created. In March 1994, Wenling was made a county-level "city".


== Transportation ==
Wenling Railway Station is located in Daxi Town, North-West of Wenling. It is part of the Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou Railway, and has connected to high speed rail lines that runs in 300km/h. In 2017, its annual ridership is about 8.5 million.
Wenling is 26km (16 miles) away from the Taizhou Luqiao Airport, located in the city centre of Taizhou.
Wenling also connects to the Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou expressway.


== Economy ==
The economy of Wenling is relatively developed. In 2018, its nominal GDP exceeds  100 billion, becoming the first city (or county, district) in Taizhou to have 100 billion GDP. Its GDP per capita is about 83,300 RMB (12,607 US dollar).
