== History ==
The first mention of "Wolveradeshusun" appears in documents from the year 1003. About 100 years later, Otto II, the Graf of Deißen-Andechs, built a castle on a hill overlooking the valley. The castle was destroyed on 7 April 1734 when lightning struck the tower storing black powder. Stones from the ruins were transported to Munich where they were used to build the Residenz.
From 1280 the town was designated a market town. In the 15th century, people were using the Loisach and Isar rivers for water transport, especially logging. Even today, you can ride a raft from Wolfratshausen into Munich.
During World War II, a forced-labor subcamp of Dachau concentration camp named Föhrenwald was located between Wolfratshausen and Geretsried.  Following the war, the labor camp was used as a displaced persons camp by the Allies. In 1957, Föhrenwald was transformed into a suburb of Wolfratshausen and renamed Waldram, to honor the Lord of Münsing who was one of the founders of the Benediktbeuern Abbey.In modern times, Wolfratshausen was formerly the seat of the district government, but this moved to Bad Tölz in 1972.
