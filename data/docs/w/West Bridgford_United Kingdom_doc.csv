West Bridgford is a town in the administrative county of Nottinghamshire, England. It lies in Rushcliffe borough, immediately south of the city of Nottingham, from which the River Trent divides it. The population was estimated at 48,225 in 2018. The town belongs to the constituency of Rushcliffe, which is held by Ruth Edwards, a Conservative.


== History ==
Most main roads in central West Bridgford are named after wealthy families that dominated its early history. There are also new developments. The roads in the Gamston development have names from the Lake District, and Compton Acres from Dorset and the Purbeck Coast.
At the end of the First World War, the Musters family sold the Trent Bridge Inn and Trent Bridge cricket ground to the county cricket club. The club  owned the inn only briefly, then resold it at a profit to a brewery. After pressure, the Musters sold land for building, but strict planning regulations were stipulated for the area then known as the West Bridgford Estate. This was planned over a grid of tree-lined streets. The main roads, such as Musters Road, had restrictions on housing density and size. All houses were specified to contain a certain number of bedrooms. Smaller houses were permitted on side streets and terraces were erected on roads such as Exchange Road for the servants of wealthy Nottingham merchants who had bought West Bridgford property.
The result is a community separate from Nottingham, with no ties of governance to it. In Nottingham, West Bridgford was sometimes dubbed "Bread and Lard Island", implying that its people had spent so much on big houses and fur coats that they could only afford to eat bread and lard. It grew from a small village in the mid-19th century into a town of over 48,000 inhabitants by 2018.


== Geography ==
The northern boundary of West Bridgford is the River Trent, spanned by two road bridges, Trent Bridge and Lady Bay Bridge, and two pedestrianised bridges consisting of a suspension bridge and a toll bridge near the Ferry Inn, linking nearby Wilford village with The Meadows area of Nottingham. These bridges link in with safer cycling routes to Nottingham city and railway station and to the university areas.
Two spans of the original medieval bridge remain, surrounded by a traffic island on the south side of the river, adjacent to Trent Bridge.


== Bridges ==
Four bridges across the River Trent allow access to the city of Nottingham.  

Trent Bridge: A road bridge with three lanes in both directions, it is highly decorated on the sides with carvings that can be seen from the river. In 2017 the bridge was fitted with permanent steel safety barriers at pavement level for the protection of pedestrians attending major sporting events nearby.
Wilford Suspension Bridge: This bicycle and pedestrian bridge to the west of Trent Bridge links the town with The Meadows.
Wilford Toll Bridge: Since August 2015 this bridge is crossed by the Nottingham Express Transit tram route connecting Clifton, Ruddington and Compton Acres suburb of West Bridgford to the centre of Nottingham and beyond. The small suburb of Silverdale is served by the adjacent ring road. The tram passes the Becket School and travels through Compton Acres into Clifton.
Lady Bay Bridge: A two-lane road bridge, originally the rail crossing for the Midland Railway's "Melton loop" from London to Nottingham via Melton Mowbray, avoiding Leicester. Despite passing right through the middle of West Bridgford, mostly on a high embankment, there was never a West Bridgford station: the nearest station on the line was at Edwalton, and even that closed in July 1941, as the line itself did in May 1967. Today much of the embankment has been removed and its route built over, but part of the line's embankment has been converted into a public footpath. Some signs of railway sleepers and stones can still be seen on the path.


== Architecture and housing ==
The central West Bridgford area has a rich diversity of buildings, mostly Victorian, although the larger properties are being demolished for development as no protection exists for the common housing stock. St. Giles Church is medieval, but heavily restored at the end of the 19th century.
Work has started on the development of 1600 houses at Sharphill and Edwalton/Tollerton triangle.

== Local government ==
There is no town or parish council.
West Bridgford was created as an urban sanitary district in 1891. It became an urban district with an elected council under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1935, the parishes of Edwalton and South Wilford were added to the urban district. This then became part of the larger borough of Rushcliffe under the Local Government Act 1972.
The town hosts the headquarters of Nottinghamshire County Council at their County Hall, a landmark on the south bank of the River Trent. Nottinghamshire County Council provides the uppermost tier of local government in the area.

Nottingham Forest Football Club play at the City Ground on the banks of the River Trent. The club was founded in 1865 and has played at the City Ground since 1898. Between 1975 and 1993 it was managed by Brian Clough and won a Football League title, two European Cups and four Football League Cups as well as fielding players Trevor Francis, John Robertson, Martin O'Neill, Stuart Pearce and Roy Keane.
At local level, West Bridgford also has a number of football teams for all ages. West Bridgford Colts FC are the largest FA approved football organisation in the country, running over 90 teams; the club includes West Bridgford Football Club the Senior section for Colts, which started in 2011 on Saturday afternoons in the Nottinghamshire Senior League. Also playing in the Nottinghamshire Senior League are Magdala Amateurs who play at the ROKO Ground.Trent Bridge cricket ground was first used for the purpose in 1838 and held its first Test match in 1899, for England playing against Australia. It is the third oldest ground to be used as a Test cricket venue after Lord's in London and Eden Gardens in Calcutta, India. Trent Bridge is also home to Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, a first-class English cricket club.
West Bridgford hosts two rowing clubs, Nottingham Rowing Club and Nottingham and Union Rowing Club, and a rowing shell manufacturers Raymond Sims Ltd. Several of the town's secondary schools feature rowing activities.
West Bridgford is home to two major Rugby clubs: Nottingham Moderns RFC in Wilford village and West Bridgford Rugby Club. Nottingham RFC moved its training base and reserve team ground to Lady Bay after the 2005/2006 season in Ireland Road, Beeston. It currently play first-team fixtures at Meadow Lane, just over Trent Bridge from West Bridgford.
West Bridgford Hockey Club in Loughborough Road was the childhood hockey club of Olympic Gold medallist and former West Bridge resident Helen Richardson-Walsh.


== Retail ==
West Bridgford has a place in retail history as the location of the UK's first major out-of-town shopping development. In 1964, an American company called GEM opened a store on Loughborough Road. However, despite ambitious expansion plans, GEM's British operations were not a success, with only two other stores at Cross Gates, Leeds and Cliff Mill, Dundonald Street, Preston being opened. National concessionaires withdrew from the stores and, in 1966, the fledgling Asda superstore chain, whose then parent company was the Leeds, Yorkshire-based dairy farming conglomerate, Associated Dairies, acquired a controlling interest in the GEM operations. The Loughborough Road site still has an Asda store, although it was replaced by a new, much larger store on land adjacent to the old site in 1999. The original building was demolished and its site is now of the current Asda supercentre car park and petrol station area.In 2018 Rushcliffe Borough Council appointed a team to recommend improvements and changes to the town. These include better design of roads, with landscaping points to improve the movement of people from Gordon Road through to Central Avenue. Both these roads have independent retailers and national chains. Other proposals include moving Bridgford Road car park underground and putting retail space at ground level.


== Education ==
