== Infrastructure ==


=== Transportation ===
State Road 50 (W. Colonial Dr) bisects the city into northern and southern sections. The portion south of State Road 50, formerly occupied by orange groves and farmland, has recently been the site of the development of numerous large-scale communities, including Johns Lake Pointe, Stoneybrook West, Stonecrest, Westfield, and Wintermere Pointe. A disparity exists between these new affluent residents, many of whom have moved from South Florida, Tampa Bay, Jacksonville, Pennsylvania and the New York metropolitan area, and longtime residents, many of whom are much less well-off.
The toll road Western Beltway (SR 429) was completed in late 2006 and links I-4 near mile marker 58 in Osceola County with Florida's Turnpike at Winter Garden. Other major roads through Winter Garden include County Road 535 and County Road 545.  CR 535 (also called Winter Garden - Vineland Road) begins at SR 50 and bisects the southern half of the city, proceeding south to Windermere, Lake Buena Vista and Walt Disney World Resort, where it becomes State Road 535.  CR 545 (also called Avalon Road) begins at SR 50 and proceeds south along the western edge of Winter Garden and along the border between Orange and Lake counties. This area remains mostly rural but is quickly developing because of the nearby toll road.  CR 545 currently ends at US 192 in Kissimmee at the border to Osceola County.
