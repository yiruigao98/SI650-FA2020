As far back as 2008, when the Gayaza–Ziroobwe Road was designated, the Ugandan government planned to tarmac the Ziroobwe–Wobulenzi Road. In June 2014, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) carried out an assessment to determine the individuals, families and businesses who will be displaced by the road works, with a view to compensate them. As at November 2014, the project was still in "preparation" stage.
