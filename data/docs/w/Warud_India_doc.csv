== Transportation ==


=== Railway ===

Narkhed and Amravati towns in Maharashtra's orange belt have waited for more than 80 years to be linked by rail. The 140-km track was first sanctioned in 1928 under the British, but stayed on the backburner. The project was revived only in 1993/94 and a budget of Rs 2.84 billion approved.The then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao laid the foundation stone. But protests by the Shiv Sena, which opposed the displacement of people, stalled the project for many more years.
In September 2008, when President Pratibha Patil inaugurated the New Amravati railway station, it seemed as if the project would be completed soon. Far from it. In November 2009, the Railway Ministry announced the link would be inaugurated in December 2010.
Narkhed-Amravati line is ready on January 2014. Railways are now available to travel from Narkhed to Bhusaval. Warud's railway station has given the name Warud Orange City because it is the biggest exporter of oranges from all over the India. The railway station is 3 km from the centre of the Warud city.
The Amravati - Chandur Bazar - Morshi - Warud Orange City - Narkher railway track is electrified. People of Warud can travel by train to cities like Amravati, Akola, Shegaon, Bhusawal, Washim, Hingoli, Nanded, Hyderabad, Narkher, Morshi, Chandur Bazar, Badnera, Indore, Bhopal, Banglore
