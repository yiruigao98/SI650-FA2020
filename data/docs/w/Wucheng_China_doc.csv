Wucheng (simplified Chinese: 吴城; traditional Chinese: 吳城; pinyin: Wúchéng) is a town in  Lishi District, Lüliang, in western Shanxi province, People's Republic of China. It is located 30 kilometres (19 mi) east-southeast of downtown Lüliang as the crow flies. The Taiyuan-Zhongwei-Yinchuan Railway runs through Wucheng, but there is apparently no passenger station here; in addition, China National Highway 307 and G20 Qingdao–Yinchuan Expressway pass through the town. As of 2011, it has 16 villages under its administration.
