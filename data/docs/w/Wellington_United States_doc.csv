The Embassy of the United States in Wellington, New Zealand along with the consulate general in Auckland provides assistance to American citizens and issues travel visas to foreign nationals who wish to visit the United States.
There have been many United States Ambassadors to New Zealand since the post was created on 12 October 1838.  The current U.S. Ambassador is Scott Brown, who was confirmed to the post on 8 June 2017.
Following the September 11 attacks, members of the Diplomatic Protection Squad, Armed Offenders Squad and the Special Tactics Group were involved in operations for two months at the embassy. It was the first time armed New Zealand police have been on U.S. Embassy soil. In 2017, an embassy staff member with diplomatic immunity was expelled from NZ but no name or alleged crime details were released.

The Embassy is located in the inner-city Wellington suburb of Thorndon, a 10-minute walk away from Parliament. The embassy is bounded by Fitzherbert Terrace to the north, Murphy Street to the west, and Halswell Street to the south, and the private girls' school Queen Margaret College to the east.
