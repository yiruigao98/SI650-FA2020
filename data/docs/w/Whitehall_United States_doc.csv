He had two godfathers: actors Nigel Havers and Richard Griffiths. He attended Tower House School in London's East Sheen area, where he was a classmate of actor Robert Pattinson. He has often joked that he resented Pattinson for taking all the best acting roles in the school plays. Whitehall auditioned for the role of Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001), but the casting director was unimpressed with him because he had not read the book. His parents sent him to boarding school at the age of eight. He attended the Dragon School in Oxford and then Marlborough College, a public school in Marlborough, Wiltshire. He took a gap year in which he decided to pursue a career in stand-up comedy. He attended the University of Manchester to study History of Art, dropping out after two terms.
