== History ==
It was founded in 1934 as AB Vibro-Betong in Stockholm. In 1936 the vibratory compactor was developed by a mechanical engineer Hilding Svenson. In 1940 the company name changed to AB Vibro-Verken.
In 1947 it launched the first vibratory plate compactor, which weighed 1.5 tonnes, being nicknamed the frog. It opened its research laboratory in 1948 and manufactured the first vibratory road roller in 1953. The site in Karlskrona opened in 1960, which made heavy rollers and had the company's technical centre. The CA 25 road roller introduced in 1970 became the world's leading compaction roller. It changed its name to Dynapac Maskin AB in 1973; at this moment the company rapidly expanded its product range.
