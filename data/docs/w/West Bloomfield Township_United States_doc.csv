Some homeowners who cited a fear of further development stated opposition to the purchase. Doron P. Levin of The New York Times wrote that "It was never clear whether those objecting were Jewish, but some Chaldeans sensed prejudice." The Chaldean group spent $1 million on renovations on the golf course and the clubhouse. Temple Israel organized social activities welcoming Chaldeans. Levin wrote that "the opposition wasn't vigorous or long-lasting". By 1990 the Jews and Chaldeans in West Bloomfield began to socialize increasingly.
