The Wadsworth City School District is the single largest employer in the city. The district has benefited from the support of the community, which passed six of the last seven levies put before the voters. In addition, the district voters supported the recent Medina County Sales Tax (the first in Ohio), at a rate of 74% for the levy. According to school district Treasurer Doug Beeman, revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, exceeded expenditures as the school system continues to manage the resources provided by the community.

== Blue Tip Festival ==
The Blue Tip Festival is a five-day celebration of the Wadsworth community.  It starts with a parade and the lighting of a 20-foot-high blue-tip match, which lights downtown Wadsworth during the festival's duration.  The festival offers amusement rides, festival foods, midway games, contests, a local merchant's tent, and other entertainment.  Additional events, such as the Wadsworth Running Club's "Matchstick 4 Mile" foot race and the "Blue Tip Idol" singing contest, challenge area athletes and performers.  Special events have included passenger train rides on the Blue Tip Express, Community Challenges between local organizations, big top circus performances, paint ball shooting ranges, pony rides, bingo tents, and assorted musical performances. 2017 marked the 45th annual Blue Tip Festival.
The festival is named after the historic strike-anywhere blue tip matches which were once manufactured in Wadsworth.  While match manufacturing left Wadsworth in the 1980s, the Blue Tip Festival uses the name and giant match to affirm the community's past and celebrate the modern American city. The festival is now run by a non-profit organization, staffed entirely by volunteers, referred to as the Blue Tip Festival Committee.  Revenues from the festival are donated to Wadsworth area non-profit groups.
