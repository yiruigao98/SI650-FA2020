The 2020–21 Belgian Division 2 is the fifth season of the division in its current format, placed at the fourth-tier of football in Belgium and the first under this name, after being renamed (Belgian) Division 2 from (Belgian) Second Amateur Division. 
The division consists of three separate leagues. Leagues VFV A and VFV B consist of teams with a license from the Voetbalfederatie Vlaanderen (VFV, the Flemish/Dutch speaking wing of the Belgian FA) and contain 16 teams, while the ACFF league contains teams with a license from the Association des Clubs Francophones de Football (ACFF, the French-speaking wing of the RBFA) and contains 17 teams. The champions from each of the three leagues will promote to the 2021–22 Belgian National Division 1.

Hamme, Sint-Niklaas, Namur FLV and Onhaye were all relegated after finishing in the relegation positions the previous season.
Duffel did not complete the previous season due to financial difficulties and was hence automatically relegated.
Vosselaar and Tilleur decided not to apply for a football license, while Geel did apply for a license but wasn't awarded one, resulting in all three teams being relegated.


==== Merger ====
Temse merged with Lokeren to become K.S.C. Lokeren-Temse, known as Lokeren-Temse. Strictly speaking, the new club is a continuation of Temse rather than Lokeren, as the latter club has been dissolved.
