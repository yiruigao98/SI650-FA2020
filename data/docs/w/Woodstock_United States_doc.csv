=== The Greenprints Project ===
The Greenprints Project calls for the construction of trails along the city's natural areas like the Little River, Noonday Creek, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' property, and in the city's core areas. Bike lanes, which within the project are considered trails, would be built along roads throughout the city.
The proposed trails would connect with existing trails elsewhere in Cherokee County as well as in the cities of Roswell and Alpharetta and Cobb County. The project also would preserve greenspace throughout the city and create new parks.
