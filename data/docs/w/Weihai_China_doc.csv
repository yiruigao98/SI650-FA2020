== History ==

Weihaiwei was the base for the Beiyang Fleet during the Qing Dynasty. In 1895, the Japanese captured it in the Battle of Weihaiwei, which is regarded as the last major battle of the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese then evacuated on 24 May 1898, when it was then occupied by the British. Since 2003, a replica of the Chinese battleship Dingyuan has been anchored here as a museum ship and memorial for  First Sino-Japanese War Chinese veterans.
Weihaiwei was under British rule from 1 July 1898, under lease agreement with the Chinese empire, until 1930, with 'Port Edward' (Weihaiwei city) serving as the capital. A Royal Navy base was built on Liugong Island. Weihaiwei became a special administrative region after it was returned to the Republic of China on 1 October 1930, but Liugong Island and its facilities were leased back to the U.K. until 1940.In 1938, the Roman Catholic Independent Mission of Weihai was promoted to Apostolic Prefecture of Weihai but it has been vacant (dormant) since 1970. Weihaiwei was occupied by the Japanese from 1938 to 1945.  There was a withdrawal of most British forces and supplies from Liugong Island, and finally a Japanese military landing and occupation of the island in 1940.The region was formally incorporated into Shandong province on 10 May 1945.  In 1949, Weihaiwei City was established, and its name was shortened to Weihai after the Communist revolution.

== Geography and climate ==

Weihai is located on the northeastern shore of Shandong; its administrative area includes Chengshantou (成山头), the eastern tip of the Shandong Peninsula (Shantung Peninsula). The city is surrounded by sea on three sides; its port is protected by Liugong Island.
Weihai lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen Cwa) in terms of latitude, but as it is at the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, its climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding Yellow Sea as well as the Siberian high and therefore experiences a humid continental climate. Springtime warming and autumn cooling are delayed by one month, winds are generally high, and the average diurnal temperature variation throughout the year is small—at only 6.73 °C (12.1 °F). Winters are cold and dry, but still warmer than inland places located at the same latitude; the average temperature in January is −0.9 °C (30.4 °F). Summers are hot and humid, and August averages 24.7 °C (76.5 °F); the annual mean is 12.48 °C (54.5 °F). More than two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September, and there are nearly 2,540 hours of sunshine per year.
