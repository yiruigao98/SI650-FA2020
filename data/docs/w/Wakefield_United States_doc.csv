Wakefield is a working-class and middle-class section of the northern borough of the Bronx in New York City. It is bounded by the city's border with Westchester County to the north, East 222nd Street to the south, and the Bronx River Parkway to the west.
Wakefield is the northernmost neighborhood in New York City (although the city's northernmost point is actually in Riverdale, at the College of Mount Saint Vincent).

== History ==

Wakefield, like the rest of the Bronx, was once mainly forested and later became farmland. With the expansion of railroad transportation via the arrival of the New York and Harlem Railroad circa 1840, the area experienced moderate development before the borough was merged with New York County as a result of the state legislature's decision to amalgamate the four original boroughs to form New York City. Prior to this merger, Wakefield and the Bronx were politically part of Westchester County (the Bronx later attained independent county status on April 19, 1912, which makes it the 62nd and youngest county in the state).
The current Wakefield station of the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line was on the site of a village called Washingtonville, which was incorporated into Wakefield when it became a village on August 8, 1889. Wakefield was named after the Virginia plantation where George Washington was born (now part of George Washington Birthplace National Monument). Neighboring Mount Vernon, in Westchester County, is named for the plantation where Washington lived for most of his adulthood.
