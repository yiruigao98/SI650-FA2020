Watsonville is a city in Santa Cruz County, California, United States. The population was 51,199 according to the 2010 census.
Located on the central coast of California, the economy centers predominantly around farming and food processing. It is known for growing strawberries, apples, lettuce and a host of other vegetables.  Watsonville is home to people of varied ethnic backgrounds. There is a large Hispanic population, as well as groups of Croatians, Filipinos, Portuguese, Sikhs, and Japanese who live and work in the city.
The Pajaro Valley, where Watsonville is located, has a climate that is around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit throughout much of the year. This climate makes Watsonville an attractive coastal environment for the neighboring inland communities with very hot summers. The Pajaro Valley Unified School District has an attendance of about 18,000 students kindergarten through 12th grades. There are several private religious-based schools in Watsonville such as Notre Dame School, Monte Vista Christian, Salesian Sisters, and St. Francis. There are also several charter schools and the non-religious independent Pre-K through 12th grade Mount Madonna School. These schools provide a wide range of educational options for local families. Predominantly Latino and Democratic, Watsonville is a self-designated sanctuary city.The larger coastal town directly north of Watsonville is the city of Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz is a draw for many young college students who attend Cabrillo College or University of California, Santa Cruz. Because Watsonville and Santa Cruz are beach towns, they draw many visitors from San Jose and from the Central Valley areas. Like neighboring Salinas in Monterey County, Watsonville produces a variety of fruits and vegetables, primarily apples, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and table mushrooms.


== History ==

Watsonville's land was first inhabited by an Indian tribe called the Costanoans. This tribe settled along the Pajaro Dunes since the land was fertile and useful for the cultivation of their plants and animals. In 1769, the Portolá expedition - first European explorers of the area - came to the area from the south, where soldiers described a big bird they saw near a large river. The story survived in the river's name, Rio del Pajaro (River of the Bird). The Pajaro River today forms a boundary of the city, and also divides Santa Cruz County from Monterey County.
The Portolá expedition continued through the area on its way north, camping at one of the lakes north of town for five nights, on October 10–14, 1769. Many of the expedition soldiers were suffering from scurvy, so progress was slow. While the sick recuperated, scouts led by Sergeant Ortega went ahead to find the best way forward. On the fifth day, Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, "This afternoon the explorers returned. The sergeant reported that he had gone ahead twelve leagues without getting any information of the harbor that we are looking for, and that he went to the foot of a high, white mountain range."During the October 10 march, the explorers first saw the Coast redwood tree (Spanish: palo colorado). A bronze plaque at Pinto Lake (now a city park) commemorates the event. On October 15, the expedition continued to the northwest past today's community of Freedom, camping that night at Corralitos Lagoon.
The area became part of the Spanish colonial province of Las Californias, and in 1804 the northern part was split off to form Alta California. The area's pasture lands were assigned to the Spanish mission to the south, in Carmel. When Mexico gained independence, it took possession of Alta California. The Spanish missions were secularized in the 1830s, and the future Watsonville area became Rancho Bolsa del Pajaro, a land grant made to Sebastian Rodríguez in 1837. Under Mexico's more liberal land-ownership laws, immigration to the area from Europe and the United States increased.
In 1846–48, the Mexican-American War resulted in the cession of California from Mexico to the United States. In 1848, the California Gold Rush greatly accelerated immigration to California. Judge John H. Watson and D. S. Gregory laid out the town in 1852. The community was incorporated as the Town of Watsonville on or about March 30, 1868 and named after Judge Watson. The town became the City of Watsonville about 1889. The voters adopted a charter in 1903.The Watsonville Railway and Navigation Company operated an interurban railway to Port Watsonville on Monterey Bay where it connected with an overnight produce packet boat to San Francisco from 1904 to 1913.


== Economy ==

The main industries in Watsonville are construction, agriculture and manufacturing. Some of the largest companies headquartered in Watsonville are Monterey Mushrooms, Driscoll's, Martinelli's, Fox Racing Shox, Nordic Naturals, Graniterock, Granite Construction, West Marine, California Giant, A&I Transport Inc. and Orion Telescopes & Binoculars.Watsonville is known for the production of crops and goods in the agricultural business along the Northern Pacific Coast. The city's economy is dependent on its agro-business market and in the distribution of crops to different parts of the world. The crops that are fundamental to the economy include: strawberries, cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, natural plants, and raspberries. Companies such as Driscoll's and California Giant spend around $280 million every year in the processing and transportation of fresh food to most cities in the area, such as San Jose, California, Castroville, California, and Santa Cruz, California where the numbers of these fruits and vegetables are insufficient for the demand of the people. The large investments by big corporations in the city and the labor force, which accounts for 75% of Latino workers, have helped the city to become ranked amongst the top most important farming cities in the United States for its agro-business market. Besides relying mainly on farming goods and practices, the economy also relies on other small private owned businesses in the city because of different industries such as: industries in the fields of electronics, service firms, non-agricultural stores, and other private owned restaurant in the area that contribute to the economy every year. The dominant industries that benefit the economy correspond to the labor forces in the field of construction, farming and manufacturing that account for the majority of the contribution to the labor force and stability of the community in the city.


=== Top employers ===
According to the City of Watsonville's 2019 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:


=== Workforce ===
During Spanish and Mexican times, the Pajaro Valley was at first used as pastureland for the Carmel mission, then was divided up into several large ranchos, mainly raising cattle. In the middle 1800s, American, British, Irish and German immigrants began farming alongside the Californios. Later in that century and into the 1900s, new immigrant workers from China, Japan, Italy, Portugal, the Philippines, and Mexico accounted for the majority of the work force in the city. The new immigrants were important to the growth of the city because the fertile land needed personnel to perform jobs in the industries of farming and construction. These immigrants were able to shape the economy of the city through their labor and settlement in the city. They created more job openings as well as a market for new private owned businesses where these laborers had the opportunity to buy goods and other needed services. Large companies then turned their interest to the city because of the large number of workers and production of crops that could be achieved in a short period of time. When these agricultural companies settled along the boundaries of the city, they created more jobs increasing the population of the city. The market of agriculture served as the main foundation of the city because it was the industry that needed the most workers, this allowed for the creation of a larger market of agriculture where companies could transport large number of crops from city to city and even to different parts of the world. The city is ranked as the 21st largest city in the country with the most Latino workers that account for 75% of the total population in the city.In 1985, cannery workers in Watsonville went on strike for 18 months to protest a decrease in their wages and benefits. In the end, they won a new contract. The movement was led by primarily Latina Women, and was noted as a historic labor rights win for the Mexicano/Chicano community.Santa Cruz County and Monterey County work together to provide training for workers in new job skills that are needed in the industries of farming and construction in the city. Colleges in the area such as California State University, Monterey Bay, University of California, Santa Cruz, and Cabrillo College are important for shaping the training of new workers, these colleges have links with companies that expose students and workers to the real labor force. Since these close links exists between schools and labor companies in the city, the economy is able to create new jobs that stabilize the income and output of the community. The agricultural business is dependent on the contribution of college students and workers with their skills gathered through the training programs at institutions in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County. College students along with expert workers have created new ways of growing and processing food that are useful for the economy and the population of the city. The workforce has changed since the 20th century because companies have created new programs in the heart of the city that better prepare workers with the skills that are requires to perform different jobs in the city. These skills include basic sections in the usage of computers systems, Internet, and other programs that are needed by companies related to jobs in the farming, manufacturing, and construction industries. These programs also include job recruitment, job subsidies, and retention services that are important for the economy and the community.According to the California Employment Department, the industry of employment in the Santa Cruz County consists of:


== Geography ==
Watsonville is located in the Monterey Bay area about 95 miles south of San Francisco at the southern end of Santa Cruz County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.8 square miles (18 km2), of which 6.7 square miles (17 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (1.42%) is water.


=== Climate ===

The National Weather Service cooperative station at the Watsonville Waterworks reports cool, relatively wet winters and mild, dry summers. Fog and low overcast is common in the night and morning hours, especially in the summer when warmer air from inland areas mixes with the cool, moist air near Monterey Bay. Its Köppen classification is cool-summer mediterranean climate.January, normally the coldest month, has an average maximum of 59.9 °F and an average minimum of 38.5 °F. September, normally the warmest month, has an average maximum of 73.2 °F and an average minimum of 51.7 °F. There are an average of 4.9 days annually with highs of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher and an average of 13.5 days annually with lows of 32 °F (0 °C) or lower. Cool nights are common in the summer, due to the influence of chilly Monterey Bay. The record high temperature from the late 20th century onwards was 106 °F on October 2, 1980. However, previously a June day has been recorded as 110 °F. The record low temperature from the late 20th century onwards was 12 °F on December 22, 1990, although a 2 °F low has been previously recorded.
Average annual rainfall is 22.42 inches, with measurable precipitation falling on an average of 61 days each year. The wettest year on record was 1983 with 48.35 inches and the driest year was 1976 with 10.66 inches. The most rainfall in one month was 15.99 inches in February 1998. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 5.93 inches on February 14, 2000. Although significant snowfall occurs several times a year on the higher mountains nearby, measurable snowfall is a rarity along Monterey Bay. On February 26, 2011, there was slight snowfall in Watsonville, though it was such a small amount that it could not be measured.


== Environmental features ==
The City of Watsonville has habitat areas that support the endangered species Santa Cruz Tarweed on the California coastal prairie ecosystem. Considerable population growth occurred since 1980, requiring preparation of a number of Environmental Impact Reports, with resultant development removing certain lands of the city from productive natural habitat.
Most of the coastal land adjacent to Watsonville is part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a designation championed by former Congressman Leon Panetta. Heading away from the coast, the backdrop features the southern end of the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Another protected natural resource is the Watsonville wetlands. Also referred to as the Watsonville sloughs, they are a system of fresh water sloughs with open water and native vegetation which extend from the city to the ocean. This slough system is only one of a few remaining wetland areas of its kind in the California Coastal Region. Not only are the wetlands home to approximately nine species of fish and over 200 species of waterfowl, raptors and song birds, but they are also a vital stopping off point on the Pacific Flyway for the thousands of migrating birds.
In 1990 both private and municipal organizations worked together to stop development and protect this important resource. The Watsonville Wetlands Watch was established at that time with the task of restoring and protecting the slough's natural habit. "Watching the Watsonville Wetlands," a book published by the organization and written by Jerry Busch, Gary Kittleson and Christine Johnson-Lyons tells the history and explains the importance of these wetland areas.

The Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos had residential sections and opened many businesses to serve their customer base in town during the mid 20th century. The history of East Asians in Watsonville dates back to the late 19th century and are involved in the local agricultural industry. It is presumed that as a result of Japanese-American internment during WWII, local farm companies began to attract Mexican migrant labor to the area in higher numbers and the town's racial-ethnic composition became more Hispanic in the 1980s and 1990s. There was also medium-sized Sikh population in Watsonville during the late 1990s to early 2000s that were involved mostly in the trucking industry, but most have moved away to the Central Valley for cheaper housing.There were 11,381 households, out of which 49.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.3% were married couples living together, 16.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.1% were non-families. 17.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

== Law and government ==

The City of Watsonville was incorporated on March 30, 1868. It adopted its first charter in 1903.  It adopted its present charter on February 16, 1960. It uses the council–manager government model. The city is divided into seven districts, each of which elects a representative to the city council. In turn, the mayor of Watsonville is not elected.  Instead the office of mayor rotates annually in December. As of 2018, the mayor is Francisco Estrada.Watsonville became a sanctuary city on April 11, 2017.


=== Fluoridation ===
Watsonville does not practice water fluoridation. A proposal to fluoridate public water supplies narrowly failed a voter referendum in 2002, and the Martinelli beverage company has threatened to move a planned expansion elsewhere rather than use fluoridated water in its products. Conversely, local health-care professionals argue that the city is experiencing a tooth decay epidemic.After several years of legal wrangling,  Watsonville was cited in August 2010 for violating a California state law that requires fluoridating the water in a town of over 10,000 people when outside money becomes available.The Santa Cruz Sentinel reported that "[i]n a 4-3 vote [on September 28, 2010], the City Council approved a contract for a $1.6 million grant from the California Dental Association Foundation to design and build a fluoridation system and operate it for two years."Eventually the California Dental Association Foundation notified the City that it would be too expensive to fluoridate the City's water supply.  In the absence of funding from an outside source, there is no state requirement and the City's water supply remains un-fluoridated.


=== State and federal representation ===
In the California State Legislature, Watsonville is in the  17th Senate District, represented by Democrat Bill Monning, and in the  30th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Robert Rivas.In the United States House of Representatives, Watsonville is in California's  20th congressional district, represented by Democrat Jimmy Panetta.

Watsonville has 65 police officers and 68 authorized positions. Its current mayor is Francisco Estrada, and its police chief is David Honda.In comparison to nearby incorporated cities, overall crime index is 24.1% lower than Santa Cruz, 15.4% lower than Salinas, and 38.4% higher than Gilroy. Watsonville is home to approximately 560 documented gang members and 9-10 known gangs. While gang activity is on the rise, crime itself continues to fall and is currently at its lowest in 30 years. Despite a significant drop in crime, Watsonville continues to suffer from its past reputation, particularly among more affluent areas in the region.
