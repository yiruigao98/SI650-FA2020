Under the Qing, Wuchuan was administered from Gaozhou Commandery (now a county-level city within neighboring Maoming Prefecture). On May 26, 1994, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the People's Republic of China agreed to Wuchuan County's elevation to county-level city status and placed it under the administration of Zhanjiang.

Jianjiang drainage basin is a region where people of Han nationality and the other Baiyue ethnic groups had lived together in history. Local authorities which are subordinated to the central government of Han nationality habe been established since the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The establishment of the local government of Luozhou and Gaozhou and their close relationships with Guangzhou have promoted the Hanization of the local Baiyue ethnic groups, which in turn made the formation of the Wuchuan-Huazhou Cantonese, a dialectal Chinese, come into being.
