== History ==
Native American Kumeyaay history within the area has been documented to 7,000 years ago. The area was home to a Kumeyaay settlement which was known to them as 'Awil Nyawa'. Remains of the prehistoric culture can still be found.
Gradually ethnic Spanish colonists moved into the area, following the establishment of missions and other settlements along the coast. Rancho de los Peñasquitos was the first rancho, the Rancho Santa Maria de Los Peñasquitos, within the boundaries of present-day San Diego County. In 1823, one league (4,243 acres; 17 km2) was awarded to Captain Francisco María Ruiz, a Commandant of the Presidio of San Diego. This one league was at the eastern part of the Los Peñasquitos Canyon and extended into Sabre Springs and up to Rancho Bernardo.
It was a way station on the Wagon road from San Diego to Warner's Ranch. From 1857 to 1860, it was a station on that road for the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line between San Diego and Vallecito via San Pasqual, Santa Ysabel Asistencia, Warner's, and Rancho Valle de San Felipe.  The ranch operated until 1962, when real estate developer Irvin Kahn acquired the 14,000- acre parcel with the intent of building a 150,000-resident planned community.In 1964, San Diego annexed most of the area, building out from Irvin Khan's community.
