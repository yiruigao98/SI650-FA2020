== History ==


=== Spanish colonial period ===
In 1569, Captain Diego de Artieda, who was sent by Miguel López de Legazpi from Cebu, landed on the shores of the town of Panay and proclaimed it as the area's capital. Later, the capital was moved to its present site upon realising that the town of Capiz was nearer to the sea and possessed better ground for docking facities. The Spaniards saw the long coastal cover and envisioned a trading and shipping center. Ports were subsequently built in Libas and  Culasi.The Panay River divided the original settlement in two, and had tributaries from the mountains that flowed through communities that sprang up along its shores. The river provided irrigation and gradually fertilized the land, and during high tide , it provided water to the lowlands than became a private and commercial fishponds that exist to this day.In 1590, the Spanish navy coming from Acapulco, Viceroyalty of Mexico made the port of Capiz its naval yard where ships sought shelter when the sea was rough. Capiz grew into a bustling port and houses of stone were built. The social and political status enjoyed by indigenous rulers of Capiz often resulted in mixed marriages with colonial Spaniards. Their mestizo descendants became the base of the town's set of Principalía, the colony's noble or patrician class. Their privileged status enabled them to build houses near the población, the downtown area whose focal points was the plaza, the local chapel along Burgos Street, and the government complex.
Their children became the beneficiaries of the Augustinian mission in 1593. In 1746, Capiz was made the seat of the politico-military government separating from the clutches of Iloilo is almost 200 years , although it was ecclesiastically controlled by the Bishopric of Cebu. In the latter part of 1795, under Gobernadorcillo Miguel Bautista, the old road to Baybay was built as an extension of calle San Roque .
The town was frequently attacked by Muslims that in 1814, stone forts at Baybay Beach (Baluarte) were built through the initiative of Gobernadorcillo José Consolación.In 1870, ground was broken for the construction of Capiz Cathedral under the guidance of Reverend Apolonio Alvarez. It was built by sturdy hands, sweat and blood of Capizeños, who were pressed into its building by the polo y servicios (forced labour) system. In 1876, the Diocese of Jaro in Iloilo was erected, and Capiz came under its jurisdiction. In 1877, the cathedral was finally finished.
During the Philippine Revolution, the Spanish colonial government capitulated in August 1899, when Governor Juan Herrero formally surrendered to General Ananias Diokno along  Baybay area.


=== American colonial period ===
After 300 years under Spanish rule, the Philippine Islands came under the sovereignty of the United States of America. By the early 1900s, Protestant missionaries arrived in the Islands, which the various denominations subsequently agreed to divide into mission territories. Western Visayas went to the American Baptists; Baptist institutions such as Filamer Christian University, Central Philippine University, Capiz Emmanuel Hospital were later established. In August 1904, Rev. and Mrs. Joseph Robbins were entrusted with care of three little children. This situation of neglected homeless children touched their hearts which led to the establishment of Capiz Home School, with the first building being a gift from the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. The Capiz Home School was later renamed Filamer Christian University, "Filamer" being a portmanteau of "Filipino" and "American".
In 1914, an economic debacle hit the town of Capiz when the Ayala Distillery abruptly stopped operations. What could have been an ambitious forerunner of nationalized industrialization became the victim of the Internal Revenue Law under American control.
In 1917, Division Superintendent of Schools F.E. Hemingway founded Capiz Trade School for intermediate pupils. The institution offered woodworking as the only vocational course. The next division superintendent opened Capiz High School.
In 1926, Division Superintendent Arthur Wittman authorized teaching of complete secondary curriculum in the Capiz Trade School. In the same year, Culasi Port was built to accommodate inter-island ships.


=== Third Philippine Republic ===
On February 15, 1951, the Diocese of Capiz became a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction from Jaro. Its first bishop was Msgr. Manuel Yap. In the same year, Vice Mayor Libertad Conlu became the city's first female Mayor.
Capiz became a chartered city on May 12, 1951 through House Bill 1528, sponsored by Ramón Acuña Arnaldo, the Representative of the First District of Capiz. It was approved by President Elpidio Quirino, Roxas' successor, on April 11, 1951 as Republic Act 603. Consequently, the town was renamed Roxas City after the late Manuel Roxas, the final President of the Commonwealth and the first President of the Third Republic.
The city's first appointed Mayor was Lorenzo Acuña Arnaldo, followed by Ramón Berjamin Blanco, José Dorado, and Juliano Alovera Alba. In 1959, Arnaldo became the city's first elected head. He was succeeded by Teodoro Roxas Arcenas, who himself was succeeded by Juliano Alovera Alba. Alba was also the Representative of the First District of Capiz when President Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law nationwide on September 21, 1972.
Antonio A. del Rosario, the incumbent Representative of the First District of Capiz, was elected to three terms as Mayor, serving from 1998 to 2007. Vicente B. Bermejo, the former governor of the Province of Capiz, was elected Mayor and served from 2007 to 2010.
Roxas City's current mayor is Ronnie T. Dadivas.


=== Historical Account of Pedro G. Gallardo, O.S.A. ===
Capiz is located on a small island formed by the Panay and Banica rivers. The Panay Rivers was famous, it is said by the great number of caimanes (alligators).
The soil is poor in the northern part of the island and is most productive only in the southern part. It is bounded by the Mindoro sea, the Panay River, Loctugan, the Mindoro Sea and Ibisan.
It enjoys balmy atmosphere and offers very picturesque views, especially from the open sea. This town was accepted in 1693 as a visita of the town of Panay. Fr. Agustin Estrada was named prior that same year. In 1707, it was declared an independent parish under the advocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.
The private council of 1716 created this town which was originally named El Puerto de Capiz, a vicariate under Fr. Pedro Vivaldi (?) as prior-vicar. In 1728, the convent was relieved from paying any rent to San Agustin Monastery. And likewise, in 1732. This suggests that the convent was rather poor or that the priors were building the parochial edifices. By this time, Loctugan and Ibisan were assigned to it as visitas.
In the middle of the 18th century, Capiz was declared the capital city of the province of the same name which later became “the most famous sea port and the biggest ministry the Augustinians had in that province.” Capiz (or Capis) was renowned all over for its shells, the capis used for window panes on houses and convents all throughout the Philippines. Tradition holds that this is the place where the Visayas dialect is spoken with “more propriety and musicality” and where “women dress with more neatness, and elegance” The Capizeños showed special loyalty to Spain during the British invasion, by sending money and ammunition to Manila and jailing the alcalde mayor, Señor Quintanilla, who was caught “conducting secret negotiation to have the province handed over peacefully to the British.”
In 1732, Capiz had 2,327 souls. In 1760 Capiz had 3,971 of which 16 were Spaniards. In 1896, its population increased to 17,683. In 1990, it reached 103,171.
Capiz was a progressive city in 1891, its exports through the sea port, reached 1,800,000 pesos and imports were valued at 900,000 pesos. It was a joy to watch, in the old times, the many boats converging, often at the same time, at the port to load rice.”
The primitive church was built before 1698, the year in which the typhoon of January 4 destroyed it together with the convent.
According to a document, the priest found it difficult “to rebuild them because the people were not used to work.” Fortunately, Fr. Domingo Horbegoso, minister of Capiz, started building the church in 1728, the year in which the convent was relieved from paying any rent to San Agustin Monastery. The construction seemed to have continued, at least until 1732 .
Capiz was founded in 1693 under the advocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.
