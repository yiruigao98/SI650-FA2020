== Etymology ==
The town had received its former name of Montalban from a derivation of the Spanish word Monte (Mountain) from the numerous hills found within and surrounding the town. A common name for the municipality up to the present, it was its official name from its founding in 1909 until 1982 when the Batasang Pambansa officially renamed it to Rodriguez under Batas Pambansa Blg.275 in honor of Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr., a native of the municipality who served as Senate President.


== History ==
Based on the 1954 journal History and Cultural Life of Montalban and its Barrios, what would then be the town of Montalban was formerly the barrio Balite which was under the jurisdiction of the town of San Mateo during the Spanish period. The town was then founded by Fr. Eustaquio of Pasig in 1871. On another account, San Mateo, with its large size, was partitioned on April 27, 1871 when Captain General Rafael Izquierdo issued a decree separating the barrios of Balite, Burgos, Marang and Calipahan from San Mateo and formed them into the new municipality of Montalban.According to the Executive Summary included in the Annual Audit Reports of Rodriguez, Rizal, the municipality of Montalban was founded on June 30, 1871 under the "Acta de Erreccion" or Deed of Foundation. The municipality was then incorporated to the newly created Province of Rizal on June 11, 1901 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 137. Montalban was then consolidated with San Mateo by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 942 on October 12, 1903. San Mateo served as the seat of government in line with the economic centralization. Montalban then became an independent municipality again by virtue of Executive Order No. 20 series of 1908 on February 29, 1908.
In 1982, the town was officially renamed to Rodriguez under Batas Pambansa Blg.275 in honor of the former Senate President and town native Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr.


=== Proposed cityhood ===
As early as 2018, the town's Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 2018 requesting the Senate of the Philippines thru its president, Vicente Sotto III and the House of Representatives through its speaker, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to co-sponsor a bill for Rodriguez's conversion into a city.


=== Proposed reverting of the name to Montalban ===
On July 3, 2019, Rizal 2nd District Representative Juan Fidel Nograles has sponsored a bill to restore the town's name to the former name of Montalban. This is a response to the numerous requests from the town's native residents to return the town's name to the former after it was changed in 1982.  In fact, the municipal government has started to officially refer to the town as "Bayan ng Montalban" (Municipality of Montalban), thereby abandoning the use of Rodriguez in official documents, office names and correspondences. Before it could even be enacted, the town leaders, beginning with the new administration that assumed office in 2019, have modified the municipal seal to that which states "Montalban" instead of "Rodriguez".

The Marikina Auto Line Transport Corporation (MALTC) buses is the only one that regularly travels to farther places like Makati and Parañaque. UV's ply the routes to Cubao in Quezon City and Santa Lucia Grand Mall in Cainta.
Formerly there was railway service under the Philippine National Railways that traverses the San Mateo - Marikina - Pasig area and had its terminus at Barangay Balitè behind the Santo Rosario Parish Church but it had been long dismantled and the railway line converted into roadway that now consists of the road aptly named Daang Bakal.
It is known that 'patok' jeepneys originated from this town way back during the 80's. These jeepneys are known for their notoriety on the road. Despite this, they are popular among the passengers hence the name patók which means 'popular'. They still ply this town up to this day, most plying the Montalban-Cubao route via Marcos Highway. These jeepneys have already spread throughout the Rizal province as well as in Marikina City since then.
