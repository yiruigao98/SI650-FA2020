== History ==
Rovenky was founded in 1705, and was incorporated as a city in 1934. By the order of Peter I, 49 Cossack villages were burned and destroyed in September 1708, including Rovenky.  The freed Cossacks fled from Peter I into an area now referred to as the "Wild Field."  Some settled in a place near a river and it was named after the abandoned native village - Rovenek.  In 1793, Count Vasily Orlor became the owner of the settlement who later became the Cossack chieftain. In 1829, the first literacy school was opened and the first primary school was opened in 1852.  At this point, the residents of Rovenky mostly worked the land, raised cattle, and bred sheep.
A local newspaper is published in the city since October 1930.During the World War II, Rovenky was occupied by Nazi Germany. A group of the underground anti-fascist Komsomol (Communist youth) organization Young Guard worked there.
During the 1960s and 1970s, there was much development in Rovenky.  Many new buildings were built, including the apartment buildings now called "Shaktyorski," "Gagarin," and "Molodyozh"."  In the 1990s, private businesses began to appear - trade, transportation, and customer services.  The backbone of the community remained its coal enterprises, which account for 95% of all manufactured goods in the city.
Since early 2014, Rovenky has been controlled by the Luhansk People's Republic and not by Ukrainian authorities. On July 11, 2014, Pro-Russian forces attacked a concentration of Ukrainian troops with "Grad" rockets, inflicted heavy damage and casualties to two motorized army brigades at Zelenopyllia  south of this place. At least 19 Ukrainian soldiers were reported killed, and around 100 other wounded. Fighting was still ongoing by evening. It was later claimed that the rocket system used in the attack was the newer 9A52-4 "Tornado".
On February 17, 2015 Bellingcat Investigation Team conducted an independent investigation and stated that Zelenopillya had been fired from the territory of the Russian Federation.
