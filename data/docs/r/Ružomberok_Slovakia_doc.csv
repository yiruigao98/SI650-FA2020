The name of the initial settlement located on today's Makovický street was Revúca (Slovak "roaring", derived from the Revúca river).  In its neighborhood, German colonists build a new settlement Rosenberg named after wild roses growing in the area. This name was later adopted by Slovaks as Ružomberok.

The town is located around 65 km from Žilina, 190 km from Košice and 260 km from Bratislava (by road). Besides the main settlement, it also has "city parts" of Biely Potok, Černová, Hrboltová and Vlkolínec.

== History ==
In 1233, the king Andrew II of Hungary granted the land Revúca (terra Reuche) to his servant Hudko (Hudkonth, in the deed of confirmation Hudko). Hudko, his son Miloslav (Mylozou) and his offspring cultivated the land where the Slovak village Revúca was founded already in the 13th century. Before 1320s, Germans founded a new settlement Rosenberg (possesio Rozumberg) right on the hill near the older village. In 1329, Revúca became a part of Ružomberok and received a new name Podhora (Sub Monte).
In 1340, Charles I of Hungary confirmed the town rights, burgesses and "guests" (German colonists) had the same rights as in Ľupča (now Partizánska Ľupča). The extend of previous rights is not completely clear. Ružomberok had allegedly the similar rights since 1318, but the charter preserved only in copy could be falsum.  The Germans had had a dominant position probably until 1431 when many rich families left the town under the pressure of the Hussites. The town council was then controlled by Slovaks and during the 15th century the town was Slovakized.In the 19th century, it was one of the centres of Slovak national movement. It slowly became one of the industrial and financial centres of the Kingdom of Hungary, particularly after the Kassa Oderberg Railway was completed in 1871, when many new factories emerged - paper and pulpwood works, but also brick works (1871) or the textile industry. 
In 1907, in Černová, which was rather a street than part of the town that is today, happened an event known as the Černová tragedy. 
After the break-up of Austria–Hungary in 1918, Ružomberok became a part of Czechoslovakia. However, when Czechoslovakia was broken up in 1939, it was incorporated into the first Slovak Republic and was a capital of one of the counties, the Tatra county (Tatranská župa). On 5 April 1945, Ružomberok was captured by troops of the I Czechoslovak Army Corps, acting as a part of the Soviet 4th Ukrainian Front. Ružomberok became again part of Czechoslovakia and after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, it became part of Slovakia. In 1995, Ruzomberok became a district town.


== Demographics ==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 30,417 inhabitants. 96.64% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.95% Roma and 0.87% Czech. The religious make-up was 75.47% Roman Catholics, 14.65% people with no religious affiliation, and 5.46% Lutherans.


== Industry and commerce ==
Ružomberok was famous in the 20th century as an industrial town. The resulting pollution has remained one of the biggest challenges facing the town. It had the biggest cotton mill in Slovakia - BZVIL or Texicom - and still has one of the biggest Slovak exporter businesses - Mondi SCP, formerly known as SCP - Severoslovenske celulozky a papierne. Texicom went bankrupt in 2006. Mondi SCP is a paper and pulp factory and is the biggest employer in the Ruzomberok district and the Liptov region. The town also has a brick factory located in the south.
