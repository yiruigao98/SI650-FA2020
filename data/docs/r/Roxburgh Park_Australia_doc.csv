== History ==
Much of what is now the suburb of Roxburgh Park was formerly agricultural land. In January 1951 the Moonee Valley Racing Club bought the 832 acres (337 ha) "Roxburgh Park" property for £35,000, as a speculative investment, although the purchase did give the club an option if it ever had to leave its somewhat cramped location in Moonee Ponds.Roxburgh Park was developed in the 1990s as a suburban area by the Victorian Government's Urban and Regional Land Corporation (later "VicUrban" and then "Places Victoria") (not unlike the new towns in the green wedges of Britain).
Recognition of Roxburgh Park was promoted in widely screened TV commercials throughout the mid-1990s, presenting Roxburgh Park's avowed virtues as a planned community with a balance of residential and industrial land, along with public reserves (part of the Shankland Reserve is in the south of Roxburgh Park), community services and access to transport. The slogan for the campaign was "Roxburgh Park – where dreams come true..."
Developments over recent years include child care centres, a retirement village and an Islamic centre. The Roxburgh Park railway station opened on 30 September 2007. The commercial hub of the suburb is on Somerton Road.
The Broadmeadows Valley Trail makes its way through the suburb, in a north–south direction.
