=== Rajasthan Atomic Power Station ===

The Rajasthan Atomic Power Station is located at Rawatbhata. it currently has six pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) units operating with a total installed capacity of 1,180MW.{{cn))
The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), the operator of the plant, is increasing the existing capacity by constructing two more reactors known as Units 7 and 8. (2×700MW=1400MW)


=== Heavy Water Plant ===
Owned and operated by the Department of Atomic Energy's (DAE) Heavy Water Board (HWB), the heavy water plant is integrated with the Rajasthan atomic power station for its supply of power and steam. An oil-fired steam generation plant was also added to ensure uninterrupted supply of steam during the shutdown periods. Canada began construction on the plant but ceased cooperation on the project after India's May 1974 test of a nuclear device. The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre(BARC) then completed designing the plant, which was originally expected to start operations in 1976. Problems associated with the accumulation of toxic chemicals created during the production of hydrogen sulphide gas, however, delayed commissioning until April 1985. These problems resulted in a cost escalation from 1.94 billion rupees to at least Rs. 7.2 billion rupees. Inadequate and unreliable supplies of power and steam from the RAPS reactors also plagued the plant and contributed to its low output. The two oil-fired boilers of the steam generation plant were added to alleviate the power supply problem. The heavy water plant uses the hydrogen sulphide water exchange process to produce up to 100mt of heavy water per year.
