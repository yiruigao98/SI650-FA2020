== Reception ==
Renigunta did fairly well at the box office, ending up as the 18th most profitable Tamil movie of the year, with a profit of 0.65 crores.Rediff wrote "It's clear that Panneerselvam has been heavily influenced by new-age gangster flicks and rural movies [..] If only he'd actually made way for a cast iron plot, this one would have fared better." Sify wrote "On the whole the film drags big time post interval and is too long at 2 hours, 35 minutes. The songs act as speed breakers and some scenes are repeated, especially the gory killings. The film is dark and disturbing." Behindwoods wrote "Renigunta is not a movie made with commercial intentions in mind. Though violence and brutality are constants throughout the movie, it is neither superficial nor forced."


== Remakes ==
In 2016 Renigunta was remade & released in Kannada as Mandya to Mumbai with only Actor Theepetti Ganesan reprising his role.
