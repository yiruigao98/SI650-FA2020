== History ==
 

Rohri is 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) west of the ancient city of Aror. Roruka, as capital of the Sauvira Kingdom, is mentioned as an important trading center in early Buddhist literature. Little is known about the city's history prior to the Arab invasion in the 8th century, but Aror was the capital of the Ror Dynasty, which was followed by Rai Dynasty and then the Brahman Dynasty that once ruled northern Sindh. 
In 711 CE, Aror was captured by the army of Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim. In 962 CE, a massive earthquake struck the region, causing the course of the Indus River to shift. Aror was re-founded as Rohri afterwards.Rohri served as a busy port along the Indus by the 1200s, and was a major trading centre for agricultural produce.
