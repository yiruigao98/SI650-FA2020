== History ==
Reynosa was founded on 14 March 1749 with 297 inhabitants by Carlos Cantú under the command of José de Escandón y Helguera the Count of Sierra Gorda. But due to flooding in the area on the 4 July 1802, they decided to move five miles to the east keeping the same margin between them and the Rio Grande. It was not until 1926 that the state government recognized Reynosa as a city.
Reynosa was first named Villa de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Reinosa. The pioneers of the Villa proceeded from El Nuevo Reino de León, especially from Monterrey, Cadereyta, Cerralvo and El Pilón. The town was composed of 50 families. It was given the name of Reynosa as a tribute to the town with the same name in Spain, the birthplace of the Viceroy de Güemes y Horcasitas.

Today it is the location of several satellite U.S. companies doing business to take advantage of low labor rates and industry incentives.On 18 September 2012, an explosion at the nearby Pemex gas plant killed 30 and injured 46 people. Pemex Director Juan Jose Suarez said that there was "no evidence that it was a deliberate incident, or some kind of attack".In 2017, it was described as a major hotspot in the Mexican Drug War, as a result of the internecine wars between the Gulf and Los Zetas drugs cartels.
