RENGO (連合, Rengō), which stands for Japanese Trade Union Confederation (日本労働組合総連合会, Nihon Rōdōkumiai Sōrengōkai), is the largest national trade union center in Japan, with over six million members as of 2011. It was founded in 1989 as a result of the merger of the Japan Confederation of Labor (Domei) and the Federation of Independent Labor Unions (Churitsu Roren). In 1990, General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) also joined RENGO.
As of July 2012, it has 54 affiliate unions and 47 local organizations.


== Party affiliation ==
Rengo is affiliated with the Democratic Party of Japan, but on June 28, 2012 Rengo president Nobuaki Koga made a speech at Liberal Democratic Party headquarters stating that the confederation may reconsider its future.
In 2014, it endorsed LDP-supported candidate Yoichi Masuzoe for the Tokyo gubernatorial election.
