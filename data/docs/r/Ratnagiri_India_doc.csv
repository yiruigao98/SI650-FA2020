Ratnagiri was  an administrative capital under the Sultanate of Bijapur. In 1731 it came under the control of the Kingdom of Satara, and in 1818 it was annexed to British India. A fortbuilt by the Bijapur reconstructed by the Maratha king Shivaji in 1670 is located on a headland near the harbour. 
Ratnagiri is the birthplace of Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak. He was born on 23 July 1856 after which he moved to Pune with his family when he was 10 years old. It was also then place of confinement for Vinayak Damodar Savarkar  from 1921 to 1935.
In 1886, King Thibaw of Burma was sent to Ratnagiri after he was deposed and his country annexed by the British Empire. Along with his pregnant wife, his junior queen, and his two young daughters, he would live out the rest of his life in Ratnagiri, as a prisoner of the British Crown. Ratnagiri was chosen for its remote location, some 3,000 miles from Thibaw's former royal seat of Mandalay, accessible only by sea for parts of the year and far from any territory of any rival European power.
