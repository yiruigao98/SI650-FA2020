== Origins ==
Historically occupied by the Maasai community, the name Ongata Rongai is a Maasai phrase which translates to "narrow plains". 
Present-day Ongata Rongai grew from a meeting of a cattle market in the northernmost tip of Kajiado county and the quarry township in present-day Kware. The cattle market and the quarry spread rapidly and joined in the late 1950s.
Due to rapid real estate development starting in the 1990s, Ongata Rongai has evolved into a high-population Nairobi suburb covering around 16 square kilometres. Greater Ongata Rongai is a medium-to-low population area. The neighborhoods of Kandisi, Rimpa, Nkoroi, Merisho, Olekasasi, Tuala, Rangau and Maasai Lodge are located to the south and east of Ongata Rongai.
