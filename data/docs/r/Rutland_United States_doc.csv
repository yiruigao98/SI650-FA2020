The city of Rutland is the seat of Rutland County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 16,495. It is located approximately 65 miles (105 km) north of the Massachusetts state line and 20 miles (32 km) east of the New York state line. Rutland is the third largest city in the state of Vermont after Burlington and South Burlington. It is surrounded by the town of Rutland, which is a separate municipality. The downtown area of the city is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.


== History ==

The city began as a small hamlet called Mill Village on Otter Creek in the early 19th century and was surrounded by the town of Rutland, named by Governor Benning Wentworth in 1761 after John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland. In the early 19th century, small high-quality marble deposits were discovered in Rutland, and in the 1830s a large deposit of nearly solid marble was found in what is now West Rutland. By the 1840s, small firms had begun excavations, but marble quarries proved profitable only after the railroad arrived in 1851. Rutland eventually became one of the world's leading marble producers. A large number of Italians with experience in the industry immigrated and brought their families to Rutland.

This fueled enough growth and investment that in 1886 the center of town incorporated as Rutland village. Most of the town was split off as West Rutland and Proctor, which contained the bulk of the marble quarries. Rutland City was incorporated as Vermont's third city on November 18, 1892. The new city's first mayor was John A. Mead.
The closing of the marble quarries in the area in the 1980s and 1990s led to a loss of jobs in the area.

To the east, U.S. 4 travels through Killington, Woodstock and White River Junction on its way toward New Hampshire.
