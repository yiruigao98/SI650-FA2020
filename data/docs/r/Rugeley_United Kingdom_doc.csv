Rugeley ( ROOJ-lee) is an industrial and market town within Staffordshire, England.
It lies on the north-eastern edge of The Chase and next to the River Trent. It lies 7.9 miles (12.7 km) north of the city of Lichfield and 9.8 miles (15.8 km) southeast of the county town of Stafford, as well as 4.6 miles (7.4 km) northeast of Hednesford town and 11.3 miles (18.2 km) southwest of the town of Uttoxeter. At the 2001 census the town's population was 22,724, increasing to 24,033 at the 2011 Census. Rugeley is twinned with Western Springs, Illinois and in July 1962 the towns made telephone history on national television when the chairman of Rugeley Urban District Council made the first telephone call via the new Telstar satellite to the Mayor of Western Springs.


== History ==
The town, historically known as Rudgeley or Ridgeley, is listed in the Domesday Book. This name is thought to be derived from 'Ridge lee', or 'the hill over the field'. In the mediaeval period, it thrived on iron workings and was also a site of glass manufacturing.  During the Industrial Revolution the economy of Rugeley benefited from the construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal and then from it becoming a junction on the railway network.
Rugeley was considered royal land and The Chase was considered a royal forest. In 1189, Rugeley was sold to the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry by King Richard I the Lionheart. Rugeley was still relatively small at this point.
1259, Rugeley had grown significantly enough to be granted the right to hold a weekly market. To this today there is a weekly outdoor market held in the town.
In 1532, the manor of Rugeley was inherited by the Chetwynd family who held it until 1764. In 1768, the manor passed to Thomas Anson, later Viscount Anson. In 1709 Rugeley was hit with two disasters. One was a fire that ravaged the town (the town had been hit by a fire sixty years prior to this too making this the second such disaster) and the other was when the Rising Brook which runs through the town broke its banks and flooded the town. Not a good year and could have easily seen Rugeley disappear from the map books.
Rugeley was an agricultural community for hundreds of years and held regular sheep, cattle and horse fairs. This reached its peak in the mid 19th century and lasting until the 1930s. The Rugeley annual horse fair was known internationally and attracted trade from far and away. To this day there is a main road in Rugeley town centre called Horsefair honouring this, as well as another street honouring the sheep fair.
Although smaller pits had existed beforehand, the town became a centre of industrial scale deep shaft coal mining from the 1950s, to access similar coal seams to those under The Chase. The Lea Hall Colliery that opened in July 1960 was the first modern coal mine opened by the National Coal Board, which managed the United Kingdom's nationalized coal industry. Nearby the Central Electricity Generating Board built two power plants. With the construction of Rugeley A and B power stations Rugeley became a major centre for electricity generation. These developments led to the town growing very quickly in the 1960s. The Rugeley A power station was designed to take its fuel directly from Lea Hall by conveyor belt (although the coal was of poor quality not suitable for Rugeley B). This was the first such arrangement in Britain. The Rugeley B coal-fired power station continues to dominate the skyline where a flue gas desulphurisation plant has been constructed. This will allow it to continue to generate electricity and comply with environmental legislation.
St. Augustine's Church in Rugeley has memorials to the Levett family, who live at nearby Milford Hall and who established the Rugeley Home and Cottage Hospital on Church Street in 1866.Between 1793 and 1967 Rugeley Grammar School provided selective secondary education for the town and also for Hednesford. Historical characters who were educated at RGS include the banker and railway promoter Edward Charles Blount and the Australian pioneer and politician Charles Bonney.


== Areas of Rugeley ==
Rugeley along with its town centre is made up of several housing estates as well as areas which were once their own identity but now are incorporated into the town including Etching Hill, Brereton, which comprises two main housing estates - St. Michaels and Five Oaks; as well as the village Slitting Mill. The other estates include Burnthill Lane/ Hagley Park area, Green Lane area, Springfields Estate, Peartree Estate, Chadsfield Estate, Ravenhill (which is included in the same Parish council as Brereton), The Beeches, The Birches, Draycott Park and the new Hawksyard Estate among them. There are also several industrial zones including the Levels/ Redbrook Lane Estates, Power Station Road, Wheelhouse Road/ Lea Hall Trading Estate and Trent Valley.
There are two main parks. Elmore Park in the town centre and Ravenhill Park in the Brereton area.


== Transport ==
For many years in the 1970s and 1980s Rugeley was served by British Rail, with four services each way to and from Stafford and Rugby/Coventry. After the closure of Rugeley A power station and Lea Hall Colliery and a reduction in rail freight, it became possible to open up the Rugeley to Walsall line for passenger traffic. Rugeley now has two railway stations Rugeley Trent Valley and Rugeley Town. Rugeley Trent Valley lies on the West Coast Main Line, and has a regular hourly service to London via Lichfield, Nuneaton, Rugby and Milton Keynes, and to Crewe via Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent. Rugeley Trent Valley also has an hourly service via Rugeley Town railway station and the Chase Line suburban route connecting to Walsall and Birmingham.
The town continues to benefit from the Trent and Mersey Canal on its eastern side which, since the popularity of canals as a leisure activity, brings additional tourism into the town. The Canal is signposted well linking the canal from Preston Brook to Shardlow running through Cheshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire.
Regular bus services 22, 23, 24, 63, 825 and 826 link Rugeley to towns of Stafford, Hednesford and Lichfield. These Arriva operated routes also link nearby rural villages of Colwich and Great Haywood. They also link the towns neighbourhoods including Springfields, Peartree and Brereton.
The major roads into Rugeley are the A460 from Wolverhampton, and the A51 via Tamworth, Lichfield to Stone before going through Nantwich and ending at Chester. A new eastern bypass was opened in 2007 to facilitate the development of new employment areas on the former colliery site, and to reduce congestion in the town centre.


== Media ==


=== Television ===
BBC Midlands Today and ITV Central cover Rugeley from studios in Birmingham. These are mainly received from the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station, however, some parts of the town are shielded from Sutton Coldfield and rely on the Rugeley relay, located at The Hart School.Some parts of Rugeley can also receive good signals from the Waltham transmitting station near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, which carries BBC East Midlands and the East Midland variant of ITV Central.


=== Radio ===
Rugeley lies within the coverage areas of the West Midland regional stations, like Heart and Greatest Hits Radio, Capital Mid-Counties and Signal 1 in Stoke-on-Trent. BBC Local Radio is covered by BBC WM from Birmingham on 95.6 FM, though reception is not good, and in some parts, BBC Radio Stoke on 94.6 FM is better received.
In terms of community radio, the town is covered by Cannock Chase Radio.


=== Newspapers ===
For many years up to 1980, Rugeley had its own newspaper, the Rugeley Times published from Bow Street. The paper was sold to the Staffordshire Newsletter. Today the town is covered by the Express and Star. Students from the local area began writing a newspaper for Rugeley called The Hart of Rugeley. This is published three times a year. The team of students are based at The Hart School.


== Demography ==
Rugeley is a mixed community in terms of age groups and household incomes, but in terms of its ethnic make-up it remains an overwhelmingly White British town; the area in which it is located, Cannock Chase, was 96.5% White British as of the 2011 census. Much of the ageing population and their families are linked to the ex-mining communities, with an increasing proportion of the younger population being new to the area and associated with the services sector. As former mining towns, Rugeley including the Brereton area suffer from a moderate level of social deprivation, with parts of the town consisting of council or ex-council house stock (such as the Springfield Estate and parts of Brereton) or former National Coal Board housing, such as the Pear Tree Estate. However, on the fringes of Rugeley there is more affluence, particularly in some of the areas bordering The Chase, some of the older Georgian streets including the conservation area of Crossley Stone or waterfront properties along the Trent and Mersey Canal.  A number of new houses were built in the housing boom of the early 2000s, providing a mixture of affordable and higher-end properties.

== Notable people ==


=== William Palmer ===
In 1855, the town gained notoriety when a local doctor, William Palmer, was accused of murdering an acquaintance, John Parsons Cook (who is buried in a still visible grave in the local St Augustine's churchyard). It was claimed that Cook had been poisoned, and in the months that followed, Palmer was implicated in the deaths of several other persons, including his own wife and brother, and possibly even some of his own children. He was put on trial for the murder of Cook in 1856, and an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the trial to be held at the Old Bailey, London, as it was felt that a fair jury could not be found in Staffordshire. Palmer was found guilty of murder, and hanged publicly outside Stafford Gaol on 14 June 1856.  Local legend has it that, on being instructed to step onto the gallows trap-door, he asked the now-famous question "Is it safe?".
Another tale holds that following the uproar surrounding the discovery of Palmer's activities, the town put in a special request to the Prime Minister requesting that they be permitted to change the name of the town to disassociate themselves from the murders. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister at the time was Lord Palmerston, who agreed to the request only on the condition that the town be named after him. For obvious reasons the locals declined this offer. The story of Palmer was told in The Life and Crimes of William Palmer (1998), starring Keith Allen in the role of the infamous doctor.
