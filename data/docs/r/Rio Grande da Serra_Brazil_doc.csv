=== Early period ===
The earliest date recorded in the history of Rio Grande da Serra is May 26, 1560 when land was allotted in Jeribatiba, the third village developed by the Jesuits. To meet local needs, salt had to be brought from the port of São Vicente up to the Alto da Serra highlands via the village now known as Paranapiacaba. In 1640, the Marquês de Alegretti officially renamed Jeribatiba "Rio Grande". The mode of transport was donkeys during that period and Mogi das Cruzes, founded in 1640, rapidly became the largest settlement. Salt was transported along the so-called Caminho do Mar (sea road) to Alto da Serra, also locally known as Zanzaláh. One of the Jesuits who died on this route was buried with a wooden cross which in 1611 was converted into a chapel, now known as the Capela de São Sebastião.


=== Nineteenth century ===
In 1840, General Antônio Manuel de Melo built a ranch on the road from Mogi das Cruzes to São Paulo. In 1855, a cholera epidemic caused devastation in the region.Until the nineteenth century, the inhabitants had been engaged in pastoral activities. On February 16, 1867, the São Paulo Railway reached Rio Grande, enabling coffee beans and timber to be transported to São Paulo. As a result, the development of Rio Grande boomed, However. it also resulted in the influx of expatriates mostly from England who established a new town at Paranapiacaba, a few miles away. The railroad encouraged the development of coal mining from 1880 and by 1895, that of manganese and graphite extraction and as well as mineral water. Expatriates from Italy, Germany and Switzerland came to work at Rio Grande from 1899 onwards.
