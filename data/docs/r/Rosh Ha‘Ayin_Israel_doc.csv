Rosh HaAyin was founded in the 1949 near the site of ancient Antipatris and the depopulated Palestinian village of Majdal Yaba (in the 19th century also known as Majdal Sadek). Many of the early residents were religious Yemenite Jews airlifted to Israel in 1949 and 1950 in Operation Magic Carpet. They added Biblical words from Exodus 19:4 to the city's logo: "I (God) carried You on eagles' wings." The place was one of the Israel Ma'abarot (transit camps) in the 1950s.
In the 1990s, new neighborhoods were built, although the town still has a large Yemenite population.
Rosh HaAyin is named after its location at the source of the Yarkon River (rosh = head, ayin = fountain, spring).
