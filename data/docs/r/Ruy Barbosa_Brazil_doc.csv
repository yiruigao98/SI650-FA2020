Barbosa made her first significant work in the film Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida, where she played the character Mylla, a young princess from a tribe of Vikings, who lived in a lost city inside a forest. Before shooting the movie, she took several Swedish language classes, since all her lines in the film were in that language.Later, Barbosa auditioned for Começar de Novo, where she played the character Ana, the guardian angel of Miguel (Marcos Paulo). This mysterious character hid important plot secrets, and had unknown origin. She had paranormal powers, with a strong spirituality, and received messages from heaven that guided on her mission on Earth. As the character did not speak, Barbosa had the added challenge of having to communicate mainly through her eyes and facial expressions. It was her first telenovela with screenwriter Elizabeth Jhin.On 5 March 2005, Barbosa debuted in children's theater as the protagonist of the play Chapeuzinho Vermelho - O Musical in the Teatro dos Grandes Atores, in Barra da Tijuca, and in Teatro do Leblon in Leblon.Barbosa's work in Começar de Novo earned her an invitation to attend the tests for the character "Sabina" in Belíssima. After going through crowded auditions, she was chosen by the screenwriter Silvio de Abreu and the director Denise Saraceni to play the role. Sabina was an important character in the telenovela plot, the daughter of "Vitória" (Claudia Abreu) and "Pedro" (Henri Castelli), and granddaughter of the villain "Bia Falcão" (Fernanda Montenegro), niece of "Júlia" (Gloria Pires), and goddaughter of "Nikos" (Tony Ramos). Sabina had a great influence on the grandmother, the villain Bia Falcao, who kidnapped her in the story. The character lived in Greece with her parents. To fully play the role, Barbosa took lessons on dance, Greek language and culture, as well as spending a month in Greece, filming the soap opera on the paradise island of Santorini. Barbosa's success in the role made her known in Brazil, and led her to being interviewed on Domingão do Faustão. She was later hired as an exclusive artist by Rede Globo.The interpretation of Barbosa in Belíssima caught the attention of screenwriter Walcyr Carrasco, who invited her to portray the character "Isabel" in Sete Pecados, the daughter of "Dante" (Reynaldo Gianecchini) and "Clarisse" (Giovanna Antonelli).In late 2007, Barbosa participated in the first edition of the competition Dança das Crianças, shown on Domingão do Faustão.

In 2008, Barbosa debuted in adult drama; she was cast by the duo Charles Möeller and Cláudio Botelho to play Clara girl in 7 - O Musical. Acting in the musical was quite a big challenge for her, as she had to represent and also had to sing and dance. Her portrayal of Clara was close to what Möeller imagined. The director Botelho said: "Marina is a demon. She has so much inner life at such a young age and, even with little experience, she shines on the scene as a veteran! That's the kind of 'child actress' we only see in the United States, those who steal movies and plays...Marina makes the difference".7 - O Musical was the last work of Ida Gomes, Marina's grandmother in the musical, as she died soon after the musical.In 2009, Barbosa co-hosted a TV Globinho program.
