This is a list of tallest freestanding structures in the world past and present. To be freestanding a structure must not be supported by guy wires, the sea or other types of support. It therefore does not include guyed masts, partially guyed towers and drilling platforms but does include towers, skyscrapers (pinnacle height) and chimneys.


== Freestanding structures (past or present) over 350 metres (1,148 ft) ==
Structures no longer standing are in italics.
For all structures the pinnacle height is given, so the height of skyscrapers may be different from the values at List of tallest buildings in the world.
Structures under construction are included in main list if its current height is over 350 metres (1,148 ft).


== Other freestanding structures (past or present): between 300 metres (984 ft) and 350 metres (1,148 ft) ==
