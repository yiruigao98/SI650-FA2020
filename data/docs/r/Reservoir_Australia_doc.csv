== History ==
The land which became the suburb of Reservoir was first surveyed by Robert Hoddle in 1837 and was formed from parts of both the Jika Jika Parish and Keelbundoora Parish.The Rose Shamrock Hotel formerly known as The Rose Shamrock & Thistle Hotel, opened on Plenty Road in 1854. Reservoir Post Office opened around 1921. Reservoir became a suburb at this time with the name coming from the three water reservoirs first built in 1863. 
The reservoirs were collectively known as Preston Reservoir, which continue to form part of the fresh water supplied to Melbourne’s inner and western suburbs. Preston Reservoir No.1, on the west of High Street, was excavated in 1863-64 and the clay was used to form the surrounding embankments, with the base and sides lined with bluestone pitchers. The reservoir commenced supplying water in 1864. The Maroondah Aqueduct was built in 1886–1891 to supply water to the Preston Reservoir from a diversion weir on the Watts River, which was dammed in 1927 to form Maroondah Reservoir. Until 1881 Preston Reservoir was Melbourne’s only service reservoir. By 1884 it was determined that Preston Reservoir needed additional water storage and an area of approximately 11ha was purchased on the east side of High Street. Reservoirs No.2 and No.3 were constructed in 1909 and 1913 respectively. Eventually reservoirs No.2 and No.3 were covered to prevent dust entering the water supply.In 1914 Thomas Dyer Edwardes donated an area of 34 acres of land to the people of the former City of Preston, which was developed into Edwardes Lake Park. Between 1919 and 1939 swimming was officially permitted with the presence of the Preston Lifesaving Club and regular demonstrations of swimming and lifesaving techniques during this time.
