Râmnicu Sărat (also spelled Rîmnicu Sărat, Romanian pronunciation: [ˌrɨmniku səˈrat], German: Rümnick or Rebnick; Turkish: Remnik) is a city in Buzău County, Romania, in the historical region of Muntenia. It was first attested in a document of 1439, and raised to the rank of municipiu in 1994.
The city rises from a marshy plain, east of the Carpathians, and west of the cornlands of southern Moldavia. It lies on the left bank of the Râmnicul Sărat River. Salt and petroleum are worked in the mountains, and there is a considerable trade in agricultural produce and preserved meat.

== History ==
Râmnicu Sărat was the scene of battles between the Wallachians and Ottomans in 1634, 1434 and 1573.
It was also here that, in 1789 (during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792), an army of Imperial Russian and Habsburg troops, commanded by Alexander Suvorov, defeated the Ottoman forces in the Battle of Rymnik. For this victory, Suvorov was awarded the victory title of "Count of Rymnik" or "Rimniksky" (граф Рымникский) by empress Catherine the Great of Russia.
In 1854 the city was almost destroyed by fire and was rebuilt. From 1901 to 1963, the Râmnicu Sărat prison operated in the city.
