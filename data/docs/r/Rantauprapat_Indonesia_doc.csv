Rantauprapat is a town in North Sumatra province of Indonesia and it is the seat (capital) of Labuhan Batu Regency. Rantauprapat is also a village in the district of Rantau Utara (North Rantau). It consists of 3 main roads. There was a saying (when Rantauprapat had only one main road) that if you forget to hit the brakes once you see the town, you will have passed the town. According to several trip agencies, the Suzuya hotel/mall is the best hotel in Rantauprapat. A number of citizens move to larger cities like Medan in search for more job opportunities and/or universities. In the year 2003 its status of administrative city was erased as it did not fulfill the requirements, and it now comprises two districts (North Rantau and South Rantau) within the Regency. A large river named the Bilah River runs through the town, which had 140,778 inhabitants at the 2010 Census.
