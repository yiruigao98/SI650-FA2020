== Climate ==
Rialto, also known as "Bridge City," features a somewhat cooler version of a Mediterranean climate, which is known for wet, cool to chilly winters with hot, dry summers.
The particularly arid climate during the summer prevents tropospheric clouds from forming, meaning temperatures rise to what is considered Class Orange by NOAA. Rialto gets an average of 16 inches (410 mm) of rain, and maybe hail most of this rainfall precipitates in winter. During winter, Rialto's northernmost neighborhood gets snow, heavily at times as a result of its elevation of about 3,000 feet (910 m) above sea level. However, most of the city is out of snowfall's path.
The seasonal Santa Ana winds are felt particularly strongly in not only Rialto but the greater San Bernardino area as warm and dry air is channeled through nearby Cajon Pass at times during the autumn months. This phenomenon markedly increases the wildfire danger in the foothill, canyon, and mountain communities that the cycle of cold, wet winters and dry summers helps create.

== History ==

Ancient artifacts discovered by archaeologists suggest that what is now the city of Rialto was settled prior to 1500. Such artifacts, now found at the Rialto Historical Society, indicate that the Serrano Indians lived in the Rialto area between 1500 and 1800 AD. There is no evidence to explain what happened to these Native Americans.An adobe building from the early 19th century, which has been used for many purposes over the years, is the oldest building still standing in Rialto and stands restored near Bud Bender Park, formerly known as "Lilac Park" on Second Street and Riverside Avenue. The City of Rialto leases the house and a small portion of park land to the Rialto Historical Society for $1 annually.
In 1842, the Lugo family was granted the Rancho San Bernardino—a holding of 37,700 acres—which encompassed Rialto. In 1851, the Mountain Family purchased part of the Lugo family's Rancho San Bernardino, and claimed several other portions of the ranch which later became known as Rialto. This claim was later amended by the United States Government, permitting them a smaller fraction of the initial purchase.In 1887 a railroad connector line was built between San Bernardino and Pasadena by the Santa Fe Railroad. Along the line, townsites were located every 2,600 yards (2,400 m) [mile and a half] and by the fall of that year over 25 new towns were being built. This same year the Semitropic Land and Water Company was formed to organize the purchase and selling of real estate, water, and water rights and privileges.In the fall of 1888, the first school was built and Brooke School District was formed. Records show that up until 1920, the Brooke School District was in continuous operation, except for a very short time in 1888. The prominent Rialto Trapp family bought the first school house in 1921, remodeled the building, and members of the family resided in it until it was destroyed by fire. The Rialto School District (today Rialto Unified School District), was formed in 1891. The staff consisted of two teachers and a principal with separate play areas for the boys and girls.
In 1901 a cemetery was established in the township. It is administered by the City Treasurer.

== In the news ==


=== School assignment debating Holocaust denial ===
In April 2014, the Rialto school district came under fire for homework assigned to about 2,000 8th graders 
 — a "critical thinking" writing assignment which asked them to take a position whether the Holocaust occurred, and to defend that position citing published arguments, including rebuttals to the selected arguments. Although the school system initially defended the December 2013 assignment, which had already been completed and graded by the time the media published the story, the board of the school district formally apologized for what its chairman called the "horribly inappropriate assignment".


=== Water contamination ===
In the late 1990s, local water officials discovered perchlorate contamination in the city's drinking water supply that contained as much as 800 times the recommended limit according to safety recommendations issued in other states.The contaminant, which has seeped into several of the town's drinking water wells, is the subject of lawsuits by the city of Rialto against 42 parties, including Goodrich Corporation and Black & Decker, the US Department of Defense, and the San Bernardino County. Both companies, most likely under contract with the Department of Defense, operated weapons manufacturing facilities which used massive quantities of rocket fuel.
After many years of negotiations, Goodrich Corporation and Black & Decker still have not agreed to clean toxic waste from the environment in northern Rialto. Studies have shown that perchlorate consumption, at the levels measured in the affected wells, can lead to medical issues. Perchlorate exposure can harm iodine uptake into the thyroid.With several other wells unusable due to contamination, the drought-prone city teeters on the brink of running out of water.


=== 2005 recall election ===
On September 13, 2005, the Rialto city council voted to dissolve the Rialto Police Department and replace it with a contract with the San Bernardino County sheriff's department. Soon after the vote, a San Bernardino County court issued an injunction on the change because the vote was done in secret. As a result, two city council members, Ed Scott and Winfred Lee Hansen, were up for recall. In March 2006, city leaders decided to keep the Police Department.
