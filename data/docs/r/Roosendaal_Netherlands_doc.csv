=== History ===
Roosendaal goes back to the 12th and 13th century.  The name Rosendaele was first mentioned in a document of 1268.  Roosendaal was always a part of North Brabant. In the Middle Ages, Roosendaal grew as a result of the turf business, but the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) put an end to the growth as Roosendaal and Wouw were suffering from itinerant combat troops that plundered and ravaged everything they came across. For decades the countryside of Roosendaal was abandoned.

On 2 September 1946 the brigade returned to the city, to be disbanded again on 1 September 1989.
