The Stamford Park homestead has been restored in recent years by Knox Council. Geographically, Rowville is one of the largest suburbs south-east of Melbourne. Rowville Post Office opened on 20 December 1905 and closed in 1987. In 1989 it reopened in the new Stud Park (formerly Darryl Park) Shopping Centre.Rowville has developed rapidly over the 1980s and 1990s, especially in terms of housing and light industrial activities.

== Transport ==
Rowville is currently a heavily car-dependent community, with many families having at least two cars. This is unlikely to change, without the addition of significant improvements to public transport serving the area, such as greater bus frequencies and coverage. The Rowville railway line, has long been called for, but lacks political commitment. Light rail connections to the north and south would also help reduce car-dependency. Three or four cars per household are not uncommon, depending on the number of children of driving age still living at home. 70% of residents drive cars to work.The current State Government has proposed that the public transport problems will be resolved by the SmartBus system, which includes special bus lanes on major traffic routes.  One SmartBus route, connecting Rowville to Caulfield via Monash University and Huntingdale Station has been established, with the other providing a link to Melbourne Airport and Frankston which began operation in 2008.
