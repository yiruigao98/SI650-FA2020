This is a list of earthquakes in 2018. Only earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above are included, unless they result in damage and/or casualties, or are notable for other reasons.  All dates are listed according to UTC time. Maximum intensities are indicated on the Mercalli intensity scale and are sourced from United States Geological Survey (USGS) ShakeMap data. In a busy year with 17 major quakes, Indonesia was hit particularly hard. More than 500 people died in Lombok in August and a major earthquake struck the Palu region in September, with more than 4,000 casualties caused mainly by liquefaction and a tsunami. Other deadly events took place in Papua New Guinea, Japan, Haiti, Taiwan and Mexico. The strongest quake with a magnitude of 8.2 occurred in Fiji, at a great depth of 600 km.
