Rösrath is located in the immediate vicinity of Cologne. The municipal area of Rösrath is bordering on the south-eastern city limits of Cologne. Therefore, from Cologne's point of view Rösrath is called a Gateway to the Berg region (Bergisches Land).
The municipal area partly extends over the nature reserves of the Wahner Heide and Königsforst.
