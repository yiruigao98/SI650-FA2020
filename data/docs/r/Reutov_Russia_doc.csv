== History ==
The exact date of Reutov's foundation is unknown; however, most historians believe that it was founded between 1492 and 1495. In the 17th-18th centuries, the village of Reutovo belonged to the dynasties of Prince Turenin and Prince Vasily Dolgorukov. At the beginning of the 18th century, Reutovo became a village. Census Book of 1709 has a record of the village of Reutovo, owned by the Prince Vasily Dolgorukov.
In 1787, the village was acquired by Prince N. I. Maslov. Under his rule Reutovo became a luxurious country estate. At the beginning of the 19th century, Prince Maslov went bankrupt and the village became a property of Lt. Col. A. M. Pokhvistnev who in 1824 built a cotton mill. Yarn from the factory was among the best in Russia and won a gold medal at the All-Russian National Show in 1831. Shortly after that Pokhvistnev sold the land and the mill.
In 1843, the land and the cotton mill was purchased by S. A. Mazurin, a Moscow merchant. He built a brick factory, dormitories, and restructured the cotton mill gradually forming a factory town of Reutovo.
Since 1955, Reutov is the host for NPO Mashinostroyeniya, formerly known as USSR Experimental Design Bureau #52, where development of various robotic and manned space satellites, ICBMs, cruise missiles takes place; the longtime director was Vladimir Chelomey.The town is separated from Moscow by the Moscow Ring Road and Nosovikhinskoye Highway. Reutov has the status of a science-town (naukograd) and celebrates its anniversary on the last Saturday of September.
