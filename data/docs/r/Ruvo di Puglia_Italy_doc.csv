Ruvo di Puglia (Italian: [ˈruːvo di ˈpuʎʎa]; Ruvese: Rìuve [ˈriːuvə]) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy, that is essentially devoted to agriculture, wine and olive growing. It is part of the Murge karst landscape.


== Geography and territory ==
Ruvo's territory is known for its vineyards, olive groves and sowable fields, and is one of the largest in the province of Bari. Its wooded area is very interesting, with many downy oak trees (Quercus pubescens). Ruvo's territory consists of the Italian Alta Murgia National Park and shows typical elements of the Apulian karst landscape: sinkholes, karst valleys also known as "lame", among which are the upper course of Lama Balice and various caves. Two important caves are the "Grave della Ferratella" (the deepest cave in the Apulia region), and the nearby "Abisso di Notarvincenzo" (the deepest in Ruvo). They are located near the wide and green Ferratella "Lama" (valley) which must be considered as the Gate of the National Park of Alta Murgia.


== History ==

The most ancient archaeological findings from the area date to the 9th century BC, when the Peucetians were settled in the area. Evidence of their presence is documented through a series of remains, most notably the fresco found in the Tomb of the Dancers. The fresco, which depicts peucetian women dancing, is one of the most important archeological findings in Ruvo and is now exhibited in the Naples National Archeological Museum.

In the 3rd century BC, after peacefully succumbing to greek rule and falling under Athenian patronage, Ruvo flourished: the now polis engaged in commerce with the rest of  Greater Greece, Greece and most of the Pre-Roman civilizations in italy and had power and strength to never be seen again. With the Greek demise, it naturally fell under Roman rule.

Under the Roman Empire it was first a military stronghold and later a municipium, but during the Imperial times it started to lose power and importance.  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it went under the Byzantines tutelage, then the Saracens and the Normans. Later Ruvo became part of the county of Conversano.
After the Aragonese and French dominations it was a fief of the Carafa family, until the abolition of feudalism in 1806.
