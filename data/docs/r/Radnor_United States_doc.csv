== History ==
In 1681 Richard Davies purchased 5,000 acres from William Penn.  These lands were sold to various purchasers and were mainly in the location of current Radnor Township.  The township was part of the Welsh Tract and was named for Radnorshire in Wales.  In 1717, the Welsh Friends erected a Quaker meetinghouse (Radnor Friends Meetinghouse) near what is now the intersection of Conestoga Road and Sproul Road at the geographic center of the township. The new town, "Radnorville", later known as the community of "Ithan" after nearby Ithan Creek, grew around the meetinghouse.  The Welsh influence waned in the late 18th century as many left the area due to high taxation.  Stone monuments were erected in various locations throughout the township in the late 20th century to commemorate the township's Welsh heritage.
Other historic structures in Radnor Township include the Sorrel Horse, a former tavern located on Conestoga Road that sheltered George Washington and Lafayette during the Continental Army's retreat back to Philadelphia from the Battle of Brandywine.Lancaster Pike, the first toll road in the United States, connected the cities of Philadelphia and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, passing through Radnor Township, opened in 1794. That road is now part of the Lincoln Highway (U.S. Route 30). The Columbia Railroad, later part of the Pennsylvania Railroad also passed through in 1832. Thus, Radnor is one of the towns associated with the local moniker "Main Line."  A separate railroad passing through Radnor Township, the Philadelphia and Western Railroad, was opened in the early 20th century.  The "Main Line" railroad facilities and a portion of the P&W facilities are still used by SEPTA (the Philadelphia area's transit authority), and the "Main Line" railroad tracks are owned and used by AMTRAK.
In the 1880s, George W. Childs bought property in the community of Louella in the western part of Radnor Township, renamed the area Wayne, Pennsylvania (after American Revolutionary War hero Anthony Wayne) and organized one of the United States's first suburban developments.

Eastern Radnor Township is served by SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line, an interurban heavy rail line. Within Radnor Township, there are seven stations located at Bryn Mawr, Roberts Road, Garrett Hill, Stadium - Ithan Avenue, Villanova, Radnor, and County Line.SEPTA Suburban Bus Route 106 bus runs directly through the center of Radnor Township. The route is primarily on Lancaster Avenue until the community of Radnor, where buses turn left on King of Prussia Road after passing under the Blue Route. At the intersection of King of Prussia and Radnor-Chester Roads, it turns left again onto North Radnor-Chester Road. At the intersection of Radnor-Chester Road and Lancaster Avenue, it turns right and continues on Lancaster Avenue for the rest of its time within township borders.  As a result of this loop, the 106 provides bus service  to students who attend Radnor High School on King of Prussia Road. The 106 serves the communities of Rosemont, Villanova, St. Davids, Radnor, and Wayne with westbound access to Paoli and eastbound access to the 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby. The 105 bus formerly drove a route similar to that of the 106, but a 2016 schedule change moved the route's western terminus to Rosemont Station, on Montrose Avenue near the border of Radnor Township and Lower Merion Township. As of 2017, the route runs parallel to Radnor Township's border on Airedale Road, but never enters the township. Occasionally, SEPTA will utilize a bus to serve stations on the Norristown High Speed Line, especially during times of inclement weather during which the tracks are rendered unusable, such as during and after extreme snowfalls. These buses will bear "NHSL" on their destination sign as opposed to a bus route number.
