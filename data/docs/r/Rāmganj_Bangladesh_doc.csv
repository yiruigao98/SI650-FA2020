Municipal Corporations,  also known as paurasabha, are the local governing bodies of the cities and towns in Bangladesh. There are 330 such municipal corporations in eight divisions of Bangladesh. A municipal corporation serving a town may be called a town council, and a municipal corporation serving a city is styled a city council; these bodies are divided into wards, which are further divided into mauzas and mahallas. Direct elections are held for each ward, electing a chairperson and a number of members. The municipal heads are elected for a span of five years.
