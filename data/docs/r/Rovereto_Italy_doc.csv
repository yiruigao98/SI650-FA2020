Rovereto (Italian pronunciation: [roveˈreːto]; "wood of Cornish oaks") is a city and comune in Trentino in northern Italy, located in the Vallagarina valley of the Adige River.


== History ==
Rovereto was an ancient fortress town standing at the frontier between the bishopric of Trento – an independent state until 1797 – and the republic of Venice, and later between Austrian Tyrol and Italy. During the Austrian time it was known by its German toponyms Rofreit and Rovereith.


== Geography ==
Rovereto is east of Riva del Garda (at the north-western corner of Lake Garda). Rovereto is the main city of the Vallagarina district.
The town is located at the southern edge of the Italian Alps, near the Dolomites. It is bordered by Monte Cengialto (686 m or 2,251 feet above sea level) to the east.


== Main sights ==
The castle, built by the counts of Castelbarco in the 13th–14th centuries, and later enlarged by the Venetians during their rule of Rovereto.
The Italian War museum (Museo Storico Italiano della Guerra) is located inside the castle. The Italian War Museum was founded in 1921 in remembrance of the First World War and in it are preserved arms and documents relating to wars from the 16th to the 20th centuries.
The mighty bell Maria Dolens, one of the largest outside Russia and East Asia, and the second-largest swinging bell in the world after the St. Peter's Bell of the Cologne Cathedral. Maria Dolens ("the grieving Virgin Mary") was built under the inspiration of a local priest, between 1918 and 1925, to commemorate the fallen in all wars, and to this day it sounds for the dead every day. Originally a patriotic rather than pacifist idea, it is today regarded as a shrine to peace.
