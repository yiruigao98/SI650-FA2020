Ribeirão Preto (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁibejˈɾɐ̃w ˈpɾetu]) is a municipality and a metropolitan area located in the northeastern region of São Paulo state, Brazil.
Ribeirão Preto is the eighth-largest municipality in the State with 650.9 km2. It has an estimated population of 674,534 in 2018 and a metropolitan area of 1,178,910. It is located 313 km (194 mi) from the city of São Paulo and 706 km (439 mi) from Brasília, the federal capital. Its mean altitude is 526.8 meters (1,728 feet) high. The city's average temperature throughout the year is 23 °C (73F), and the original predominant vegetation is the Atlantic forest.
The city was originated around 1856 as an agricultural region. Coffee was a primary income source until 1929 when it lost value compared with the industrial sector. In the second half of the 20th century, investment in health, biotechnology, bioenergy, and information technology led to the city being declared a Technological Center in 2010. These activities have caused the city to have the 30th biggest gross national (GNP) in Brazil.
The city is also an important cultural center. The Prefeito Luiz Roberto Jábali Park, the Maurilio Biagi Park, Carlos Raya Park, Santa Tereza Reserve, and the Zoo are important preservation areas. Pinguim Beerhouse, Dom Pedro Theatre, and projects such as Ribeirão Preto's Cinema Center are relevant sightseeing points, along with events such as the Agrishow Agricultural Fair, Tanabata Festival, Joao Rock Music Festival, and the National Outdoor Book Fair.


== Population ==
Adding to the Native Amerindians already living in the area when immigrant populations began to occupy and settle the land, the population of Ribeirão Preto includes, amongst other groups, descendants of Africans, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Japanese immigrants who were attracted to the region because of the coffee agriculture, right after the abolition of slavery in 1888, when immigrants were granted lands, after being indentured workers. Descendants of enslaved African people constitute a big and important element of the population. Italians arrived in huge numbers, followed by Germans, Spaniards, Eastern Europeans, and Portuguese.
During the 1990s, Northeastern migrants came to the region attracted by São Paulo state cities' economic development, which was widely broadcast in TV documentaries. With the city's super population by individuals who often had no technical skills and were often illiterate, poverty and crime grew considerably. Many migrants boosted the economy by working in sugar cane plantations and orange groves, though. However, those who perform seasonal duties often have no safety net when the work is over. IBGE research indicates that Ribeirão Preto has a population of 666,323 inhabitants. The urban agglomeration incorporates 34 municipalities, with a population of about 1.4 million inhabitants.

== History ==

The city was founded June 19, 1856, being populated initially by farmers coming from the southeast area of São Paulo and Minas Gerais looking for land with good pastures. The city was built by a stream called Black Creek, and was named after it (Ribeirão Preto means black creek in Portuguese, sometimes translated as "Black Stream", which is also the name of a hotel in the city). The farmers had chosen well was revealed to be a good one; the fertile soil of the Ribeirão Preto region allowed a high crop productivity.
The rapid development of coffee cultivation brought wealth and progress to the city, which by the 1880s had become the largest coffee producer in the world. Coffee, also called "green gold," caused a "gold rush" in the region, which attracted workers and adventurous people from many parts of the world. This movement was helped by the new Mogiana Railway, linking Ribeirão Preto to São Paulo and to the port city of Santos, and by the abolition of slavery in Brazil, in 1888. The end of slavery created a strong market for labor, and "coffee barons", as coffee farmers were called, also stimulated immigration. Immigrants coming from Europe (mostly Italy, but also from Portugal, Spain and Germany) and from Japan have settled in coffee farms of Ribeirão Preto and neighboring towns. Later, after the stock market crash of 1929, some of these immigrants bought farms from their impoverished former employers.


== Culture ==

At the beginning of the 20th century and during its first three decades, Ribeirão Preto was a rich city, boasting several mansions, European-style cafés, cabarets and even two opera houses, as result of the coffee economy. One of the opera houses – the Carlos Gomes Theatre (in honour of Brazilian opera composer Carlos Gomes) – was demolished in 1949 but the other – the "Pedro II Theatre" (named in honor of Emperor Dom Pedro II), dating from the 1920s – resisted time and was restored and modernized during the 1990s. Its ceiling, completely destroyed in a fire of 1980, was rebuilt and gained a new design projected by Japanese-Brazilian artist Tomie Ohtake. The Pedro II Theatre is now the third largest opera house in Brazil and is the home of the Ribeirão Preto symphony orchestra, one of the oldest and most important in Brazil.
An important fact for the city life happened in 1911 with the opening of its first factory, the Antarctica Brewery Company, nowadays part of the AmBev group. It was Antarctica which built the Pedro II Theatre. The Antarctica factory led to the opening of several beer houses in the city and one of them named Pinguim (penguin in Portuguese), became particularly famous and made Ribeirão Preto nationally renowned for the quality of its draft beer (chope or chopp in Brazilian Portuguese). Many people say that Pinguim has the best draft beer in Brazil and it became so important that it is now a symbol of the city; people say that coming to Ribeirão Preto and not visiting Pinguim is like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope. There are four Pinguim beer houses in Ribeirão Preto: two of them, called Pinguim 1 and 2 respectively, are at the November XV square (the central square of Ribeirão Preto) right beside the Pedro II Theatre. The other two are at the shopping centers Santa Úrsula and Ribeirão Shopping respectively. The Penguin beer house was named after the Antarctica company's logo (see at [1]).Many small "alambiques" exist in the region, each producing its own singular "Pinga," better known as Cachaça. These "Pingas" are often aged and are available in many flavours, while still maintaining their flair.
Pinguim is not the only good beer house in Ribeirão Preto. Ribeirão Preto is a hot climate city, which makes people go out in the evening to chat and enjoy cold draft beers in bars. Therefore, the city is teeming with bars, from the simple "botequins" or "botecos" that one can find in almost every corner, to the most sophisticated pub style bars, which rival their counterparts in São Paulo and Rio.
Ribeirão Preto also has one of the first micro-breweries in Brazil, Cervejaria Colorado, founded in 1997. It produces three different types of beers, two ales and one lager. Cervejaria Colorado is located at Rua Minas and has a bar at Avenida Independencia where it offers 70 different labels of beer from all over the world.
Ribeirão Preto is considered one of the major centers of business tourism in the country, being chosen by the Ministry of Tourism as an inducer of regional tourism development, between 4 cities of São Paulo and 64 other locations throughout Brazil. Currently the city has 52 hotels in full operation, with 8600 beds (or jobs), beyond 30 motels with 2000 beds, beds totaling 10,600 rooms in the network of the city.
Several events occur in Ribeirão preto annually, such as the Agrishow (an international fair of agricultural technology), Fair Photo Image, Film Festival Ribeirão Preto, National Book Fair of Ribeirão Preto, Fair ExpoHair, Feitrans (Fair Transport Interior Paulista), Festival Tanabata (Japanese cultural festival), Festitália (Italian cultural festival), Arena Cross, João Rock Winterfest, Ribeirão Rodeo Music, Bonfim Paulista Rodeo Show, Ribeirão Skol Folia, Entorta Bixo, Ribeirão Cana Invest, Expobonsai, AVIRRP, Comida di Buteco, Restaurant Week Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto Tropeada, Mitsubishi Rally Cup Copa Chevrolet Montana, and others.

=== Cinema ===
Ribeirão Preto is a major center of cinema in Brazil, with the Kaiser Film Studios, held by the São Paulo Film Commission, with space of more than 13 thousand square meters of constructed area and houses an entire infrastructure for audiovisual production. Situated in the historic city center, (the Company's former headquarters Brewery Paulista), this historical and cultural heritage is listed by the Defense Council of Historical, Artistic, Archaeological and Tourism of the State of São Paulo (Condephaat), Council of Heritage Preservation Cultural de Ribeirão Preto (Conppac) and at present is in the process of overturning the Iphan – "Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage.
In addition, the city still has the largest film society in the country, Cineclube Cauim (900 seats), and dozens of mainstream cinema rooms, such as UCI, Cinemark and Cinepolis.


=== Carnival ===
Ribeirão Preto is the birthplace of one of the oldest samba schools in Brazil: in 1927 founded the "Bambas" However, as a string carnival, becoming samba schools later. Besides this pioneering school are the Ambassadors of Elysian Fields, Tradition of Ipiranga, Golden Falcon, 12 Corinthian Shirt Emperors and Samba.
In 2010, Ribeirão Preto was chosen as the theme for Águias de Ouro Samba School's parade in São Paulo Sambodrome, showing its history related to coffee, sugar cane and agribusiness.
There are also a few street carnival groups, such as "Os Alegrões" (Jardim Irajá neighborhood) and "O Berro" (in the city center).


== Sports ==
The city possesses two soccer stadiums, the Estádio Palma Travassos (of Comercial FC) and Santa Cruz (of Botafogo FC). Botafogo FC is currently competing in Campeonato Brasileiro Série B and Campeonato Paulista, whereas Comercial FC is currently competing in Campeonato Paulista Série A3. On the national and international scene, Botafogo is often confused with the Rio de Janeiro club with the same name to the extent that the Rio club is often credited with being the infamous club against which Pelé scored a record 8 goals in one game. One example is in Franklin Foer's book "How Soccer Explains the World". But it was in the Paulista championships on November 21, 1964 in the coastal city of Santos and against the Ribeirão Preto team that Pelé achieved the incredible feat and his Santos team won by an 11 × 0 score. The 8 goals were payback for the defeat Santos suffered on September 6, 1964 when they visited Ribeirão Preto during the first round of the tournament and lost 2 x 0. Not only had a "small" team beaten one of the "big" teams, but had done so while insulting the "King". A better claim to fame for Botafogo (often referred to as Botafogo-SP) is that Brazilian soccer captains (and brothers) Sócrates and Raí started their careers with Botafogo.
In 2017 a men's volleyball team was founded in Ribeirão Preto, Vôlei Ribeirão, which was champion of Superliga Brasileira B in 2018, and now competes in Superliga Brasileira, the major volleyball league in Brazil. The matches of Vôlei Ribeirão take place at Cava do Bosque.


=== National Team Training Centres (CTSs) FIFA World Cup 2014 ===
Ribeirão Preto was among the municipalities that met the basic requirements for a training centre for 2014 FIFA World Cup. Therefore, it was selected by France national football team as base for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The stadium Santa Cruz was the training base, while the theater Pedro II hosted press conferences.


== Economy ==

After the New York Stock Exchange crash of 1929 the economy of Ribeirão Preto, based on a single export crop, collapsed, and the city had to adapt to a new situation. Since the city is relatively far from other major Brazilian urban centers, it found a new economic vocation in the services and commercial sector, which was developed to attend the local and regional demands.The second economic boom in the history of Ribeirão Preto occurred after the oil crisis (1973 and 1979) of the 1970s. The increase in the oil price obliged Brazil to look for alternative means of fueling and the solution found was the alcohol fuel program, or Pro-Álcool as it is called. Pró-Álcool led to the development of a technology which allows the use of ethanol (sugarcane alcohol) either as automotive fuel or as a gasoline additive. The latter improves performance and substitutes lead thus decreasing polluting emissions. Due to the Pró-Álcool program, farmers from the region of Ribeirão Preto were encouraged by government subsidies to grow sugarcane. The high productivity of the land around Ribeirão Preto rapidly placed the region as the largest alcohol and sugar producer of the world, being responsible for 30 percent of Brazil's sugarcane alcohol fuel.

Contrary to what happened during the city's first economic boom, this time Ribeirão Preto farmers and entrepreneurs did not concentrate themselves exclusively on a single crop and diversified their investments making the city one of the most important agribusiness centers of Brazil. Besides sugarcane, Ribeirão Preto's major products are: animal feed, meat, dairy products, medical materials, dental materials, textiles, steel, furniture, building materials, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and, of course, beer. The city hosts "Agrishow" on an annual basis, this show being one of the most important agricultural trade shows in Brazil.The sugarcane boom brought a new age of prosperity for the city, which was called the "Brazilian California" during the 1980s and early 1990s. On the one hand, this has increased the city's wealth and turned it into a sophisticated center of services for Brazil and South America but, on the other hand, the image of a new "Eldorado" attracted many migrants from impoverished areas of Brazil leading to a rapid population growth and the appearance of slums (favelas as they are called in Brazil) including all the negative aspects associated with them like drug trafficking and high violence and crime rates, an unfortunate fact that Ribeirão Preto shares with all other major Brazilian cities.The airline Passaredo Transportes Aéreos has its headquarters in the Jardim Aeroporto area of the city.


== Government ==
The municipal administration is given by the executive power and by the legislative power. The first to govern the municipality was João Gonçalves dos Santos, who was in the position of intendant for some months of 1874. Currently the municipal mayor is Duarte Nogueira, from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB).


=== Twin towns – sister cities ===
Ribeirão Preto is twinned with:

During the economic stagnation from the 1940s to the 1950s the city discovered and established its vocation as an educational and university center. In 1942 the state government expropriated the Monte Alegre Farm, an important coffee farm from the Schmidt family of German immigrants, and transformed it into an agricultural practical school. Several new buildings and houses for the professors were constructed on a land which held before tens of thousands of coffee plants. The new school was very well planned and urbanized and many trees were planted to provide shadow and give it a pleasant atmosphere. But the agricultural school never achieved a significant development and it was closed in 1951. A longstanding dream of the population of Ribeirão Preto was to have a university and in 1952 the old farm was donated to the University of São Paulo for the creation of a medical school, which was the first school of its campus at Ribeirão Preto.
Fortunately, many original buildings of the agricultural school and even some of the Monte Alegre Farm were preserved and only adapted to hold the new university, which makes its campus one of the most beautiful university campuses in Brazil. After the creation of the medical school the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto (USP-RP) has been growing steadily and it is presently constituted by eight schools: School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto (FMRP), School of Law of Ribeirão Preto (FDRP), School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters (FFCLRP), School of Dentistry (FORP), School of Economics, Administration and Accounting (FEARP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP), School of Nursing (EERP) and School of Music (DMRP-ECA).
The creation of USP-RP stimulated the cultural and academic life in Ribeirão Preto and several schools, colleges and universities were opened in the city since then. Nowadays the town has many other colleges and faculties such as Centro Universitário Moura Lacerda, Faculdades Bandeirantes, Centro Universitário Barão da Mauá, Faculdade Anhanguera, Faculdade Reges, Faculdade São Luís, Faculdades COC (Colégio Oswaldo Cruz), Universidade de Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP), Universidade Paulista (UNIP), Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP), Fundação Fritz Muller (FFM), FGV-COC (Fundação Getúlio Vargas).
One interesting fact is that in Ribeirão Preto there is one Local Cometee of AIESEC. Present in over 110 countries and territories and with over 60,000 members, AIESEC is the world's largest student-run organisation. Focused on providing a platform for youth leadership development, AIESEC offers young people the opportunity to be global citizens, to change the world, and to get experience and skills that matter today. Their office is in Rua das Paiseiras, casa 9, USP, Monte Alegre.
