Sharon Heights or Heights of the (Great) Plain) is a city located on Israel's central coastal strip in the south of the Sharon region, bordering Tel Aviv to the south, Hod HaSharon to the east and Herzliya and Kibbutz Glil Yam to the north.

== History ==

Ramat HaSharon, originally Ir Shalom (Hebrew: עִיר שָׁלוֹם‎, lit. City of Peace), was a moshava established in 1923 by olim from Poland. It was built on 2,000 dunams (2 square kilometres (0.77 sq mi)) of land purchased for 5 Egyptian pounds per dunam. In the 1931 census, the village had a population of 312.In 1932, the community was renamed Kfar Ramat HaSharon (Heights of Sharon Village).  By 1950, the population was up to 900.  Rapid population growth in the 1960s and 70s led to construction of many new roadways, schools and parks. Several distinct neighborhood evolved in the 1970s, including Morasha on the southern edge, one with many military and air force personnel in the eastern edge, and many successful professionals moved into the developing city. Ramat HaSharon became a highly desirable place to live in the 1980s as a very safe place, containing many gardens and wide boulevards, and attracting many upper middle class suburban families.
While qualifying for city status by number of residents (with more than 30 thousand residents) from the 1980s, Ramat HaSharon's mayors preferred to maintain the local council designation and acted to maintain the character of the settlement by limiting development. In 2002, Ramat HaSharon was granted city.
