This is a complete list of cities in Ukraine. On 1 January 2010 there were 459 cities (Ukrainian: місто, misto) in Ukraine. City status is granted on the decision of the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada). The city status is only partially related to the size of a populated place in Ukraine.

There are three categories of cities that depends on status of those cities in the country and in the table below are indicated by a respective letter as a city status (see legends below for the city status lettering identification). All cities have some level of significance. Any settlement that obtains city status becomes a city of district (район, raion) subordinance. The cities of regional significance can either be of oblast subordinance or republican subordinance (in Crimea). The cities of national significance are officially known as the cities with special status. The significance of a city does not relate to whether the city is an administrative center and such industrial cities like Kryvyi Rih, Mariupol, Makiivka, Horlivka, Kamianske and others have the same level of significance as the regional administrative centers.
Below is the list of all cities estimated by population in 2019 and compared to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, except for Chernobyl which population is an unofficial estimate.
