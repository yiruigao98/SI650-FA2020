== History ==
Morong, originally called Bayandati, was a small settlement located in Barrio Nagbalayong. Due to the scarcity of land available for cultivation, the early inhabitants migrated to adjacent areas where wider lands can be discovered. They found Poblacion, the present site where the Spaniards met the natives of Moron.

Folkloric tradition alludes the etymology of the name Moron to the Spaniards' mishearing of the phrase "mga Moro umurong" when they asked the local people the name of their village. The historical accuracy of this etymology is questionable, however, since early Filipinos could not have known or used the term Moro as it were the Spaniards who have started using the term to refer to Filipino Moslems, a Spanish term for the Moslem Moorish conquerors of 8th century Spain.
The most probable etymology comes from the Spanish word morón which refers to a hill which can be seen from the sea. Several towns are also named Morón namely Morón in Cuba; Morón de la Fronterra in Sevilla, Spain; and Morón in Buenos Aires, Argentina. These place all have hilly topographies and are nearby the ocean.
On June 10, 1955, Moron was renamed Morong by virtue of Republic Act No. 1249.In 1754, it became part of Corrigimento de Mariveles together with Bagac and Maragondon, Cavite. But it was only in 1607 that Morong was officially founded as an ecclesiastical parish by the Augustinian Recollects as well as being founded by Fr. Rodrigo de San Miguel who placed it under the protection of the Our Lady of the Pillar. The Our Lady of the Pillar Parish of Morong, erected in 1607 and is now one of the oldest seats of Catholic faith in the Philippines; originally orchestrated from the elements of the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque sources. It culminated its 400th Year foundation anniversary on October 12, 2007.

Although both had arrived at approximately the same time, the allies were the first to notice the other party (the Japanese). To therefore commit a surprise attack, Lieutenant Edwin P.
