Minab (Persian: ميناب‎, also Romanized as Mīnāb) is a city and capital of Minab County, Hormozgan Province, Iran.
Minab is not far from Bandar Abbas. It is famous for fishing (especially shrimps) and for agriculture (especially date palms and mangoes). It lies on the main official road connecting Bandar Abbas, the Makran and the Baluchistan Province. The population are mainly Shi'a Muslims but a Sunni minority does exist, and the language they speak is Minabi (locally Minow), a dialect which is something between Bandari, Balochi and Persian. Once a week, a well known bazaar called "Panjshambe bazar" or in Minabi language "Peyshambe Bazar" (English: Thursday's Bazaar) attracts people from all over Hormozgan, and beyond.
In ancient times Minab had the name of Harmosia (or Harmozeia).
