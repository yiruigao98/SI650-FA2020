Maroantsetra [maronˈtseʈʂə̥], formerly Louisbourg, is a market town and domestic seaport in Analanjirofo Region, Madagascar, at the northern end of the Bay of Antongil. In 2005 it had an estimated population of 22,503 people.


== History ==
Maurice Benyovszky arrived in Maroantsetra in February 1774. He established a colony here, which was named Louisbourg. A hospital was built as well as a quarantine on Nosy Mangabe island just off the coast.


== Geography and climate ==
Maroantsetra is a coastal town in northeastern Madagascar, approximately 900 kilometres (560 mi) by air northeast of Antananarivo. The Antainambalana River flows into the bay after meandering around the town. It is one of the wettest places in Madagascar due to the trade winds, and receives an average of 138 inches (350 cm) of rain annually.


== Landmarks and economy ==
Maroantsetra is the main point of access to Masoala National Park and the Nosy Mangabe special reserve. A regional centre for distance education (CRTE) of the Centre National de Télé-Enseignement de Madagascar (CNETMAD) is located in Maroantsetra. The NGO CPALI operates in the town and is noted for its production of wild silk. There are hotels near the beach front in the southwestern part of the town including Hotel l'Hippocampe and Masoala Resort. There is a branch of the Bank of Africa in the town. The Maroa Arts Centre is next to the church.


== Transport ==
The town is served by Maroantsetra Airport. Due to poor communications by road, in 2007 the International Monetary Fund considered a project to develop the Northeast corridor road to Toamasina a priority, a part of a wider scheme in the area.
The Melissa Express passenger boat operates between the town and Mananara, and further on to Soanierana and Ivongo. The trip to Mananara typically takes about three hours and runs twice a week between September and February, though the service is not always reliable due to adverse weather conditions.
Cargo boats permit passengers and travel to Mananara, Île Sainte Marie, Tamatave and Antalaha.
