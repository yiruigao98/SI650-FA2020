== History ==
Historically, Malakal was known as Makal a word derived from chollo/shilluk language meaning "this world is temporary" which name was given by the shilluk/chollo king. The Malakal town started as a tiny village which later expanded into a big town becoming the capital city of the Upper Nile State. During the Second Sudanese Civil War, the town was a garrison town of the Khartoum-based Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). Following South Sudan's independence on 9 July 2011, the troops from the Republic of Sudan have retreated from Malakal. Malakal was the site of the November 2006 Battle of Malakal.
Beginning in 2013, Malakal has been the site of numerous battles between government SPLA forces and the Nuer White Army, loosely commanded by the SPLM-IO which is headed by Riek Machar.  The city has been overrun on various occasions by both sides. As of October 2015, Malakal had exchanged hands twelve times during the civil war, and was utterly destroyed in the process.
