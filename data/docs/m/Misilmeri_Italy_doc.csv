Misilmeri (Sicilian: Musulumeli) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Palermo, Sicily. It is approximately 15 kilometres (9 mi) from Palermo and its name means "the resting place or the messuage of the Emir", and dates from the Muslim emirate of Sicily. The village rose around a castle (today known as Castello dell'Emiro, or "Castle of the Emir") founded by emir Jafar II (998â€“1019).
Misilmeri is located in the Eleuterio Valley on the southern slopes of Montagna Grande.
It is the birthplace of the magistrate Rocco Chinnici.
