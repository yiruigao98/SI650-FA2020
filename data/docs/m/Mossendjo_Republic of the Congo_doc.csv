The infrastructure of Mossendjo has been  improved since 2006, owing to the Congo government's program of revitalizing Mossendjo and Dolisie. New streets and sewage drainage systems have been constructed in both cities.Mossendjo Airport has regularly scheduled airline service to Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, via Air Maouene. Road access to Dolisie and Mayoko still is via rough, sometimes graded dirt roads. The region has cell phone coverage service by TelCel.
