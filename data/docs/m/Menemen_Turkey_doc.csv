Menemen is a traditional Turkish dish which includes eggs,  tomato, green peppers, and spices such as ground black and red pepper cooked in olive oil or sunflower oil. White cheese, and charcuterie products such as sucuk or pastırma may also be added. Menemen may be made with onions, but the addition of onions is often debated and is more common when menemen is eaten as a main dish, rather than at breakfast. The dish is similar to shakshouka.
Menemen is commonly eaten for breakfast and served with bread. Its name originates from a small town in Izmir Province.


== Etymology ==
According to Turkish etymological dictionaries Kubbealtı Lugatı and Nişanyan Sözlük the word menemen is unclear in origin. Turkish etymological dictionary Nişanyan Sözlük states that the dish's name might have been derived from Menemen, a town and district in Turkey's İzmir Province, but this reliationship is unclear. The dictionary also hypothesize that it might have evolved from meleme/melemez, which means "lazy, lazy person" in Anatolian dialects of Turkish. The word might have been used to connote "lazy person's dish". The oldest attested usage of menemen is recorded in 1988.


== Preparation ==
The tomatoes should be finely diced or may be grated. Grated and diced tomatoes can also be mixed together, depending on the cook's preferred texture. If onions are being used, they should be added to the pan with the green chili peppers and sautéed with heated butter or oil. Aleppo pepper may be added. The addition of onions is often debated and is more common when menemen is not eaten at breakfast but as a main dish. Some Turkish cooks like Saniye Anne insist that a proper menemen can not be made without onions. In 2018, Turkish food critic Vedat Milor launched a Twitter poll to resolve the discussion about onion within menemen. The poll became widely popular with 437,657 people voting. Onion side had the slight victory with 51%.Sucuk can be added to the pan after the peppers have softened. This adds some flavor to the oil; the sucuk can be removed from the pan before the tomatoes are added to avoid overcooking, but this is not necessary. The tomatoes should become very soft and the mix should not be too watery when the eggs are added. The eggs may be beaten together with salt, pepper and any desired fresh herbs or added directly to the pan. If pastırma is being used, it is added to the pan with the eggs. Kaşar cheese or white cheese may optionally be added on top of the eggs just before they finish cooking, along with a garnish of fresh herbs or scallions. It is usually served in the pan in which it is cooked, a double-handled cooking pan known as sahan, together with fresh bread.Some variations may include mushrooms or minced lamb. Different spices may be added according to taste including cumin, paprika, mint and thyme.
