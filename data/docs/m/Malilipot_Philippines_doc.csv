The Philippines is administratively divided into 81 provinces (Tagalog: lalawigan). These, together with the National Capital Region, are further subdivided into cities (Tagalog: lungsod) and municipalities (Tagalog: bayan).
Cities are classified under the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160) into three categories: highly urbanized cities, independent component cities, and component cities. Cities are governed by their own municipal charters in addition to the Local Government Code of 1991, which specifies their administrative structure and powers. They are given a bigger share of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) compared to regular municipalities.
As of September 7, 2019, there are 146 cities (33 highly urbanized, 5 independent component, 108 component) and 1,488 municipalities encompassing the country.
