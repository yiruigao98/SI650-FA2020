== History ==


=== From the Prehistory to the Middle Ages ===
There is evidence of human presence in the municipality from the Middle Paleolithic that consists in a site named Las Toscas-El Chorico. Molina del Segura was also inhabited by people belonging to the Argaric civilisation. One group of remains is located in a hill in the east end of the territory. As a matter of fact, it also covers part of its adjacent municipality Fortuna. The site was originated in the Chalcolithic. There are some groups of remains corresponding to the Iberians. One site occurs in the northern half and the other in the east end.The Romans ruled large part of the Iberian gradually since 209 BC. They left in Molina de Segura a via or road that connected Carthago Nova (Cartagena) to Complutum (in the current Alcalá de Henares in Madrid) and another one that connected Elche with Cieza. Apart from those viae, they caused the existence of more remains.There was a war in which Muslim peoples were involved with ruling the peninsula purposes and it begin in 711. The Visigothic king Theodemir and the governor of North Africa Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa signed the Treaty of Orihuela. It established Muslim sovereignty in the southeast of Spain, that includes the current municipality Molina de Segura. They built an alcazaba (Moorish fortification) in the early 11th century. It was part of a spot that was surrounded with walls. According to Arabic travellers, the territory was a crossroads. Besides, the main town, there was a settlement of that era.In 1243, the king of Taifa of Murcia signed the Treaty of Alcaraz. Consequently the former Taifa of Murcia would become part of the Crown of Castile. This condition was effective in Molina from 1266. The new kingdom of Murcia was repopulated during the following decades and this current municipality was part of that fact. The nobleman Alonso Fajardo granted excellent condition to the people from Christian kingdoms who moved to Molina de Segura with a document named Carta Puebla in 1396. The territory was named Molina Seca (Dry Molina) in documents related to Christian kingdoms.The current municipality passed on several owners until it belonged to the nobleman Juan Manuel. There are remains that Juan Manuel fortified the fortification.The population of Molina increased during the last centuries of the Middle Ages. After the death of Juan Manuel, Molina received vicissitudes caused by the desires of some possible owners. Finally, it was ruled by the Crown directly during the reign of Henry II of Castile. When Henri III of Castile was the king, the adelantado (governor) Alfonso Yánez Fajardo was bestowed the territory.


=== Early modern period and Late modern period ===
The social and administrative structures didn't vary considerably from the beginning of the Early Modern Period until the Spanish confiscation. There was a significant decrease in population and economy was adversely affected owing to the explulsion of Jews in 1452.Two disasters occurred in the mid-17th century: a plague epidemic in 1648, and a flood in 1651. After the flood, the irrigation system was formed again. As a result, there was an increase in agriculture matters and in population and it reached the highest level during the 18th century. The agriculture received modernisation in the vegetables and mulberry areas. The mulberry conditions lead to a splendour in the silk produced in Molina. The apogee also affected the town and a specific phenomenon of that is the construction of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción Church in 1765.In the second half of the 19th century, tinning economic activities of the grown products started in Molina, but they were performed in a crafted way during the first decades. During that era there was a prevalence of the windmill industry.In 1916, the municipality started to have Molina de Segura as its name.Before the second half of the 20th century, the economy was based on agriculture and ranching. The most grown products were the peach, the apricot, the onions, the peppers, the tomatoes, some cereals, the almonds and the grapes. The most used animals in ranching were the sheep. The food tinning industry was developed during the first half of the century and that fact lead to a economy transformation in which it became mainly industrial. This industry reached its apogee in the 1940s, then Molina became one of the major tinning industry spot nationwide and even worldwide.During the 1990s the industry suffered an important crisis and some factories were forced to close. The secondary sector was diversified as a consequence.
