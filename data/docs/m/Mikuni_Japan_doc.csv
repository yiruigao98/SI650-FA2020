Mikuni (三国町, Mikuni-chō) was a town located in Sakai District, Fukui Prefecture, Japan.
In the 1870s, the Meiji government constructed a harbor at Mikuni, under supervision of the Dutch engineer George Arnold Escher.
As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 23,207 and a density of 499.94 persons per km². The total area was 46.42 km².
On March 20, 2006, Mikuni, along with the towns of Sakai (former), Harue and Maruoka (all from Sakai District), was merged to create the city of Sakai.
Every August there is a fireworks display at Sunset Beach in Mikuni. Many of the fireworks are floating charges distributed by boat. These explode on the water's surface, creating unique effects.
