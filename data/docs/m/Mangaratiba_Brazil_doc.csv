Muriqui (also known as Vila Muriqui) is a district of the municipality of Mangaratiba, located within the Greater Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is part of the Green Coast. Highway BR-101 passes through the district.


== Etymology ==
The district was named after muriquis, a genus of spider monkeys. The name "muriqui" itself comes from a corruption of the word myraqui, of the Tupi language, with the alternates buriqui, barigui and baregui. According to Alcides Pissinatti, in "Management of Muriquis in Captivity" (2005):
Its approximate meaning is "people that swing as they come and go" and it refers particularly to the large, pale brown monkeys that inhabit forests along Brazil's Atlantic coast, initially assigned the scientific name of Ateles hypoxanthus by Wied-Neuwied (1958).
However, according to von Martius' glossary, the word comes from the Tupi words jemoroo ("to nourish"; muru, "nutrient") and aiké (a contraction of aikobê: "to have", "to exist").


== History ==


=== Colonial era ===
Prior to 1567, all land that now belongs to Mangaratiba – including modern-day Muriqui – was part of the freguesia of Angra dos Reis, under the Captaincy of São Vicente. After that date, those lands became part of the (Royal) Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro. In 1568, the colonization of the region of modern-day Mangaratiba begins through the distribution of land to the Sá family.At some point before 1598 – the year Francisco de Mendonça e Vasconcelos came to Rio de Janeiro to take office as governor – Salvador Correia de Sá finished building a new engenho (the fifth sugarcane mill of Rio de Janeiro). As per the recounting of Anthony Knivet:
[...] the same yeere (1598) there came Francisco de mondunsa de vesconsales (Francisco de Mendonça e Vasconcelos) for Governour to my Masters place, that day the Hulke which the new Governour was in, came to the mouth of the Haven, the Governour Salvador Corea de Sasa (Salvador Correia de Sá) was at a Sugar-mil that he had newly finished.
According to Vieira de Mello, this engenho was located in Itacuruçá, the district which Muriqui was part of until the middle of the 20th century, and thus became known as "Engenho of Itacuruçá" (Portuguese: Engenho de Itacuruçá). Additionally, Mirian Bondim claims that this engenho was located in the same place as modern-day Muriqui, and it is referred to by the Mangaratiba town hall as the first construction in Mangaratiba land.On 8 June 1652, D. Suzana Peixoto and her husband, Dom José Rendon de Quebedo, exchanged an engenho they owned in Irajá, known as "Engenho Fumaça", for the Engenho of Itacuruçá and some farms in Mangaratiba. Prior to this exchange, the governor of Rio de Janeiro Salvador Correia de Sá e Benevides (son of Martim Correia de Sá and grandson of Salvador Correia de Sá) owned the Engenho of Itacuruçá.


=== Late modern period ===
As a part of a series of expansions to the Central Railway of Brazil (Portuguese: Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil), on 7 November 1914, the Muriqui train station was inaugurated.On 1 December 1949, via a legislative decree, the district of vila de Muriqui is delimited on land previously belonging to the district of Itacuruçá, and annexed to the municipality of Mangaratiba.


== Population ==


== Fauna and Flora ==
Muriqui is surrounded mostly by Atlantic Forest, which heavily influences its fauna and flora.

		
		
		


== Hydrography ==


=== Beaches ===
Muriqui has direct access to the Atlantic Ocean through the Muriqui beach (Portuguese: Praia de Muriqui), located to the west of Sepetiba Bay (Portuguese: Baía de Sepetiba). In terms of balneability, the Muriqui beach has been mostly deemed improper for bathing, although there have been recent efforts in an attempt to clean Mangaratiba rivers and beaches.


=== Rivers ===
Muriqui is centered between two rivers, with Rio Catumbi to the east and Rio Muriqui (sometimes called Rio da Prata) to the west.To mitigate the risk of flooding, both rivers are periodically dredged.


== Culture ==


=== Folklore ===
Muriqui has its own folklore, limited to the region, and separate from the national-level folklore.
The story of the "Vieira Wind" (Portuguese: Vento Vieira) is part of the oral tradition of the district. The tale is usually related to the high-speed winds in the area during winter (roughly in the period from the end of August to the start of September).According to the Brazilian Archaeology Institute (Portuguese: Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira, shortened IAB), there are two different versions of the story. The first and more common one, which has been retold by Mangaratiba's official culture manager Fundação Mario Peixoto, was described by local newspaper Jornal Litoral in 2015 as follows:
The second version, arguably more grounded in reality, although less common, is as follows:


=== Art ===
Muriqui is home to an art installation by Japanese artist Mariko Mori called Ring: One With Nature, inaugurated atop the Bride's Veil (Portuguese: Véu da Noiva) waterfall in August 2016 to celebrate the 2016 Summer Olympics. The piece is an acrylic ring that changes in color depending on the position of the sun, and is meant as a representation of a sixth Olympic ring. It measures about 3 metres (9.8 ft) in diameter and weighs around 2 tonnes (4,400 lb).

		


=== Cuisine ===

Muriqui's most well known delicacy is the cocada (known as Cocada de Muriqui), deemed to be one of the famous sweets of the Mangaratiba cuisine. According to Fabrini dos Santos, a SEBRAE consultant, the cocadas are distinctive enough that they could, at some point, be granted a geographical indication. The district's cocada has existed at least since the construction of the BR-101 highway, and has been sold on its shoulders ever since.The coconut-based dessert has had such a cultural impact that, in March 2018, the "Cocada Party of Muriqui" (Portuguese: Festa da Cocada do Distrito de Muriqui) was added to the municipality's official event calendar, to be celebrated annually on the last weekend of the month of July.
