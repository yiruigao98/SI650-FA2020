== History ==
There is evidence of human occupancy from the Prehistory, specifically the Neolithic. During the Calcolithic this municipality was also occupied by people of the Argaric civilization.The people that lived in the territory during the Bronze Age have left a remarkable site: El Cigarralejo, which was a Iberian settlement and included a necropolis and a shrine.During the Roman Hispania era there was also people presence in the current municipality. Remains of that fact are some archaeological sites. One of them is a former villa named Villaricos. There were people in a former town that is currently an archaeological site which name is Cerro de la Almagra.
In Muslim Iberian Peninsula era there were people living in Mula and they established a town in the same place as the current town.In the year 1243 the muslim king Ibn-Hud started to bestow vassalage to the kingdom of Castile as a result of the Treaty of Alcaraz. However, Mula and other towns (Lorca and Cartagena) refused to accept that status. The following year, there was a siege in the square of Mula. As a result, the town surrendered owing to the starvation. Muslim people of the area were taken their properties and were forced to move to Puerta de Mula, a hamlet of the municipality where.As Reconquista ended and all the Iberian Peninsula was again under Christian rule, a expulsion of people who had not convert to Christianism was ordered. As a consequence, there were a lack and a need of people presence in several areas of the peninsula. Almost 100 people moved to Mula from Christian kingdoms in Iberian Peninsula.During the 17th century Mula was scenery of epidemics and starvation. The plague disease of 1648 took half of the population life.In the early 19th century people experienced a poverty situation. The lack of cleaness, the lack of harvests, the war and two strong epidemics caused population losses. In Peninsular War context, French people invaded and plundered Mula in October 1812.In the early 20th century, two urban structures and services were set: the railroad and a reservoir. In that century vines and olive trees stopped being growed as traditionally and citrics began to be raised. That fact led to a need of more water and to the reservoir construction.A population rise occurred until the 1960s and the number of inhabitants consisted of 15,000 in that year. As population was increasing the town was expanding to the south.After the increase in population, it became stabilized because there are few wealth sources: agriculture and water supplies. Therefore, the number of inhabitants depends of the level of this economy activity and the level of that resource.


== Economy ==
The economy of Mula rests on dryland farming and ranching. Manufacturing in Mula is concentrated in the food and beverage sectors. The "El Arreaque" industrial park, to the east of the town center, was inaugurated in 2004.


== Main sights ==


=== Religious buildings ===
Saint Michael's church (la Parroquia de San Miguel) is located in Mula's City Hall Square (La Plaza del ayuntamiento de Mula). With its two towers, including a clock tower, it forms a large monumental complex that often serves as the logo of the municipality. This church suffered near total destruction during the Spanish Civil War; only the entranceway was saved. The rest of the decorative paintings and sculptures were destroyed. It is known that the canopy of the old altar and the wall paintings were done in the Baroque style. It was quite tall for its era.
The church contains two chapels: to the right, the Chapel of Marquesa (marchioness) Vélez, and to the left, the Chapel of San Felipe. The latter chapel contains relics of the saint brought from Sicily by Marquesa Vélez in 1648.
This church has an art museum made possible by a donation from Doña Pilar de la Canal, widow of Don Pedro Luis Blaya, in 1940. It collection spans from the 16th to the 20th centuries.


=== Castle of the Vélez Family ===
The castle was mentioned by Al-Idrisi, a 12th-century traveler and by King Alfonso X. In the 15th century it had a massive wall to the north. There was one wall to protect the cisterns of the city and another wall to watch over the city's two parishes recently converted to Christianity; these walls remain.
The architecture of the castle is Renaissance in its defensive character and simple forms, situated over a crag of rock.  Of the two entrances, one of them accedes better to the high part of the wall and the towers of the old Muslim fortress in addition to a drawbridge. It contains four differentiating elements: the torre del homenaje, a central nave with a barrel vault, a structure semidetached from the nave and a cistern. The cistern is an indication of Muslim influence because it is an essential element of a mosque.


=== Museums ===
"El Cigarralejo".  In this museum are exhibited the remains, ceramics, and utensils of the Iberian epoch, which have been taken out from the ruins of a town, necropolis, and sanctuary of that time.
Casa Pintada (many-colored house):  The museum is located in a Renaissance palace, and contains a collection of many of the works of Cristobal Gabarrón.

On the first occasion (November 11, 2007) 114 painters, coming from all over Spain, met on a sunny, spring-like day.  It was in every way a success that did not distance the residents and visitors, given the beauty and variety of places that Mula possesses.  It was one more occasion to visit this historic and welcoming Murcian city.

There is a football pavilion, hall, "Grand Route" and a sports center with another pavilion, an outdoor pool, and tennis and basketball courts.


== Festivals ==


=== The Night of the Drums ===
The origin of the playing of the drum in Mula is difficult to narrow down, but it seems to have taken place during the 14th century, as a form of protest.  It is not presently clear that the first mention written that we have of the playing of the drum through the streets of Mula go back to the municipal ordinances of 1859, where it is written that only those persons authorized through the Brotherhood of Carmen were allowed to go through the streets with drums, and only in the procession.  For this reason it is supposed that already at that time in the Holy Week of that year the people went out to play drums through the streets.
It is believed that this tradition of playing drums comes from the beginnings of the fourteenth century.  It is possible to think that through the ages in which the playing of the drum in this locality, Holy Week, it could have been thought that it is a form of religious demonstration, but it is not at all the case that the people of Mula begin to play drums in protest at the restrictions and prohibitions imposed by the civil and catholic authorities in the locality.
On the night between the Holy Tuesday and the Holy Wednesday, in the plaza of the town hall, thousands of people dressed up in black tunics with huge drums congregate in and around the plaza outside the town hall. A few minutes before the clock strikes 12,    the street lights in  the plaza are dimmed and all goes silent. Suddenly all the drummers raise their hands above their heads and create a beat by banging their sticks together. A fanfare of trumpets join in and finalise the end of the introduction. A few seconds then pass and the ground begins to tremble and shake and you can feel the vibrations through your whole body as thousands of drums begin to play at once, the ground begins to tremble... and in this way begins the Night of the Drums of Mula.
The drummers don't stop the playing the drums for the whole night. MEan women and children march the streets all night beating upon their drums in a repetitive beat. The drumming continues into the next day and often after that.


=== The drum ===
The instrument is fabricated in a homemade form by craftsmen from Mula.  The modern drum may have changed over the length of the years, perhaps losing something of the originality, taking many of the elements of the next town of Moratalla.  But moving toward perfection in many perceptions.
The instruments, whose diameters seldom approached 45 centimeters, had a like complement of drumsticks with fine points, that served to drumroll and beat without great force.  Now, the drum that is highly valued is that with large dimensions (55, 60 or 65 centimeters in diameter) and drumsticks with point in form of a "club" with which one can strike with force on the skin of the drum.
The method of manufacture of the drum also has changed.  In the past it was not possible to commission a blacksmith for a box and screws.  The people used their ingenuity with laths, to constitute the base of the drum.  In those cases the skins were tightened using some holes punched in the rings and winding a cord to constrict them.  The strings were made with intestines of animals.  In the present day, the drums are made with a metallic box, screws to tighten and the strings are guitar cords.
