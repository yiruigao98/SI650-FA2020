Mont-Saint-Aignan (French pronunciation: ​[mɔ̃ sɛ̃t‿ɛɲɑ̃]) is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region in north-western France.
The inhabitants of the town of Mont-Saint-Aignan are "Mont-Saint-Aignanais".Due to the presence of higher education institutions (notably the University of Rouen and the NEOMA Business School) and the city's relatively small population, Mont-Saint-Aignan is considered the French city that has the largest proportion of students relative to its population (students represented in 2014 25,61% of the total population).


== Geography ==
The town is the fifth-largest suburb of the city of Rouen and lies directly adjacent to the north side of Rouen at the junction of the D 121 and D 43. In addition to its population of 21,265, there are also around 20,000 students at the University and the various Grandes Écoles.


== History ==
The parishes of Saint-Aignan (Sanctum Anianum) and Mont-aux-Malades (Monte Infirmorum, which takes its name from a hospital) are mentioned in documents dating back to the 12th century. Henry II built a church there dedicated to Thomas Becket in 1176 in an attempt to make up for his unwitting role in the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
The modern commune of Mont-Saint-Aignan was created in the early 19th century (1815–1819) out of the merger of the communes of Monts-aux-Malades, Saint-Aignan and (partly) Saint-Denis-de-Bondeville.
