Mila (Arabic: ميلة‎) is a city in the northeast of Algeria and the capital of Mila Province. In antiquity, it was known as Milevum (in Latin; as such still a Latin Catholic titular see) or Miraeon, Μιραίον (in Ancient Greek) and was situated in the Roman province of Numidia.

=== Ancient history ===
In Ptolemy's Geography, IV, iii, 7, the city is mentioned under the name of Mileum or Mireon. During the Roman era it was called Colonia Sarnensis Milevitana, after the River Sarnus in Campania, whence the colonists had emigrated. This name is often found in the inscriptions of the city. Together with Cirta, Collo and Rusicade, Milevum formed the confederation known as the Four Colonies, the territory of which was very extensive. In the 6th century the Byzantine Emperor Justinian had Milevum enclosed by a fortified wall, which still stands and forms a rampart for the Muslim city of Mila. It has yielded quite a number of Latin inscriptions from this city and a colossal statue of Saturn.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Milevum was among the many towns of sufficient importance in the Roman province of Numidia, in the papal sway, to become a suffragan diocese.
The historically recorded bishops of this episcopal see were

Pollianus, present at the Council of Carthage (255) called by saint Cyprianus of carthage on the lapsi, Christians who accepted forced pagan sacrificing to avoid martyrdom, himself martyred two years later
St. Optatus, noted for his work De schismate Donatistarum (circa 375) against the Donatist heresy; he died in about 385 and is commemorated on 4 June
Honorius, deposed for incompetence according to Church Father Augustine of Hippo
Severus, fellow-countryman and correspondent of the above St. Augustine; attended, with his schismatical Donatist counterpart Adeodato, the Council of Carthage of 411, with other African bishops of both sides
 Morcelli next list Optatus II, who was probably in fact bishop of Vescera
Bennatus participated in the Council of Carthage of 484, called by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, after which he was exiled, like most Catholic bishops
Restitutus, who attended the Fifth Œcumenical Council in Constantinople in 553.Two church councils were held at Milevum, one in 402 and the other in 416. The second appealed to Pope Innocent I for repression of the Pelagian heresy.
The bishopric is last mentioned, as one of the thirteen subsisting suffragan sees in Numidia, in the Notitiae Episcopatuum in the reign of Byzantine emperor Leo VI (886-912).
