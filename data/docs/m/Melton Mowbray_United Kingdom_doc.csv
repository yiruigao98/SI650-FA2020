It is considered part of the Greater Melbourne metropolitan area and is included in the capital's population statistical division.Melton began as a small town before being declared a satellite suburb in 1974, separated from Melbourne's urban area by a green wedge.

== Transport ==

Road transport and in particular the motor vehicle are the main form of transport. Melton has been identified by the Department of Transport as one of the most car-dependent communities in Greater Melbourne. As such its residents rely heavily on its substantial network of busy roads. The Western Freeway connects Melton with Melbourne's west runs through the urban area to the south, but bypasses the city centre which is located along High Street, a very wide dual carriageway with service lanes.  There are two major freeway interchanges at the centre of the urban area.  Both are diamond interchanges, one at Coburns Road which is the main north-south arterial and another for Ferris Road/Melton Highway (C754) on the eastern fringe.  These interchanges generate heavy traffic congestion and are major accident blackspots. A road reservation exists for a third diamond interchange at Bulmans Road on the western fringe. The C754 is a popular alternative route to the northern suburbs of Melbourne and branches north to the Melton-Gisborne Road (C705) at Kurrunjang connecting Melton to Gisborne. The roads play an important role in public transport with Sita Buslines routes serving the suburbs between 5:30am-9pm on weekdays and 8am-9pm on weekends connect the suburbs to the railway station and also Melbourne's outer suburbs including the 456 to Sunshine via Caroline Springs; 457 from Melton West to the railway station; 458 Kurunjang to the railway station; and 459 Arnolds Creek to the railway station via Westlake.
