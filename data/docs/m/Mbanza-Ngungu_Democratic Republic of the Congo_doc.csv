Mbanza-Ngungu, formerly known as Thysville or Thysstad, named after Albert Thys, is a city and territory in Kongo Central Province in the western part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, lying on a short branch off the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway. It has a population of nearly 100,000 people.


== Overview ==
Formerly known as a resort town, it is home to the Thysville Caves, which encompass the entire range of the colourless African blind barb.  It is home to a major FARDC garrison: the 1st Armoured Brigade was based here during the early '90s period. The 1st Armoured Brigade was first listed in the IISS Military Balance in 1982-83 edition, implying that the brigade may have been created during that period. The city's other main industry is railway engineering.
The city is currently the main site of Kongo University.
