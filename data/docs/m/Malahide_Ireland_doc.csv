Malahide (ma-la-HYD; Irish: Mullach Íde) is an affluent coastal settlement in Fingal, County Dublin, Ireland, situated approximately 18 km north-east of Dublin city.  It has a village centre surrounded by suburban housing estates, with a population over 16,000.
Malahide Castle dates from the 12th century and is surrounded by a large park, part of which incorporates an international cricket ground.  The area also features a sandy beach, a marina, and a variety of sporting clubs.


== Etymology ==
The modern name Malahide may come from "Mullach Íde" meaning "the hill of Íde" or "Íde's sand-hill". It could also mean "Sand-hills of the Hydes" (from Mullac h-Íde) probably referring to a Norman family from the Donabate area. According to the Placenames Database of Ireland the name Malahide is possibly derived from the Irish "Baile Átha Thíd" meaning "the town of the ford of Thíd". Malahide Bay was anciently called Inber Domnann, the "river-mouth of the Fir Domnann".


== Location and access ==
Malahide is situated 16 kilometres north of the city of Dublin, lying between Swords, Kinsealy and Portmarnock. It is situated on the southern shore of an estuary where the Broadmeadow River comes to the sea; on the opposite side of the estuary is Donabate. To the east of the village the Gay Brook or Gaybrook Stream passes through the Yellow Walls area to reach the estuary in a marshy area.The village is served by the DART and the train, run by Irish Rail. The Dublin Bus 32, 42 and 102, the 32X and 142 peak hour express services, and 42N Nite-Link route serve the town from Dublin City Centre.  Route 102 serves local areas to / from Dublin Airport (via Swords) and Sutton Station (via Portmarnock).


== History ==
While there are some remnants of prehistoric activity, Malahide is known to have become a persistent settlement from the coming of the Vikings, who landed in 795 and used Malahide Estuary (along with Baldoyle Bay, where they had a longphort) as a convenient base. With the arrival of the Anglo-Normans, the last Danish King of Dublin retired to the area in 1171.
From the 1180s, the history of the area is tied to that of the Talbot family of Malahide Castle, who were granted extensive lands in the area and over the centuries following developed their estate, and the small harbour settlement.

There is an ancient covered well, St. Sylvester's, on the old main street (Old Street, previously Chapel Street), which used to have a "pattern" to Our Lady each 15 August.
In 1475 Thomas Talbot, head of the Talbot family of Malahide Castle, was granted the title Admiral of the port of Malahide by King Edward IV, with power to hold admiralty courts and levy customs duties on all merchandise coming into the port. The office was hereditary, and the family's right to act as Admiral was confirmed by the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1639.By the early 19th century, the village had a population of over 1000, and a number of local industries, including salt harvesting, while the harbour continued in commercial operation, with landings of coal and construction materials. By 1831, the population had reached 1223. The area grew in popularity in Georgian times as a seaside resort for wealthy Dublin city dwellers. This is still evident today from the fine collection of Georgian houses in the town and along the seafront, and Malahide is still a popular spot for day-trippers, especially in the summer months.
In the 1960s, developers began to build housing estates around the village core of Malahide, launching the first, Ard na Mara, in 1964.  Further estates followed, to the northwest, south and west, but the village core remained intact, with the addition of a "marina apartment complex" development, adjacent to the coastal village green.


=== Today ===

Malahide grew from a population of 1500 in 1960 and by 2011 had a population of 15,846, and is still a rapidly growing outer suburb of Dublin.  Most of the population lives outside the core village area, in residential estates such as Seapark, Biscayne, Robswall, Chalfont, Ard Na Mara, Millview, Yellow Walls Road, Seabury and Gainsborough.
In Malahide village there are extensive retail facilities and services including fashion boutiques, hair and beauty salons, florists, food outlets, and a small shopping centre with a supermarket. There is a wide selection of pubs (including Gibney's, Fowler's, Duffy's and Gilbert and Wright's) and restaurants and there is also the 203-room Grand Hotel.

== Transport ==


=== Trains ===
Malahide railway station opened on 25 May 1844. It is now one of the northern termini of the DART system, (the other being Howth). The station features a heritage garden and an attractive ironwork canopy. The ironwork in the canopy contains the monogram of the Great Northern Railway ('GNR'), who operated the route prior to nationalisation of the railways.
The railway crosses the Broadmeadow estuary on the Broadmeadow viaduct known locally as The Arches. The original viaduct was a wooden structure built in 1844, which was replaced with an iron structure in 1860 and a pre-cast structure in 1966-7.


==== Viaduct collapse ====

On 21 August 2009 the 18:07 train from Balbriggan to Connolly was passing over the 200-year-old viaduct when the driver noticed a subsidence and the embankment giving way on the northbound track. The train passed over the bridge before it collapsed and the driver alerted authorities. An inquiry was to investigate the possibility that sea bed erosion was the primary cause of the collapse. 
A member of Malahide Sea Scouts, Ivan Barrett, had contacted Iarnród Éireann five days before the collapse about possible damage to the viaduct and a change in water flow around it.
