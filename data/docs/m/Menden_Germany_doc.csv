Menden is a town in the district Märkischer Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located at the north end of the Sauerland near the Ruhr river.


== History ==
Menden's first churches were built in the 9th century. From 1180 on the area around Menden was part of the Cologne region, however, as it was on the border with the County of Mark, it was often fought over. In 1276, it received city rights. Industrialization started early: in 1695 needle production was the first industry, later followed by limestone products such as cement. In 1816 Menden was included within Prussia, after being part of Hesse for 13 years. In 1975 the city was merged with several previously independent municipalities, thus it grew in area as well as population.
