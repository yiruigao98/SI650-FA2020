== History ==
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the area known today as Montebello, the land along the Rio Hondo River was populated by the Tongva (Gabrielino) portion of the Uto-Aztecan family of Native Americans. The Tongva occupied much of the Los Angeles basin and the southern Channel Islands - Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, San Clemente and Santa Barbara; when Spanish explorer Juan Rodrigues Cabrillo arrived off the shores of Santa Catalina in 1542, he was met by the Tongva people.  Because the language of the Tongva was different from the neighboring tribes it was called "Gabrielino" by the Spanish.  As more non-natives arrived and settlements were established, illness and disease came with them.  By 1870, the area had few remaining indigenous inhabitants as disease brought by the Europeans killed many of the Tongva.Father Angel Somera and Father Pedro Cambon, both Franciscan missionaries, founded the original Mission San Gabriel Arcangel, called Mission Vieja on September 8, 1771; the location is today near the intersection of San Gabriel Boulevard and the Rio Hondo River.  The establishment of the mission marked the beginning of the Los Angeles region's settlement by Spaniards and the fourth of twenty-one  missions ultimately established along California's El Camino Real. The mission did well initially as a farm and cattle ranch.  Six years after its founding, however, a destructive flood led the mission fathers to relocate the establishment farther north, to its current location in what is the present day city of San Gabriel. The original mission site is now memorialized as California Historical Landmark #161.During the early years of the mission's existence, the region operated under a "Rancho" land grant system.  The current city of Montebello consists of land from Rancho San Antonio, Rancho La Merced, and Rancho Paso de Bartolo. The Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe, built in 1844, still stands at the center of old Rancho la Merced in East Montebello. Recently restored, Rancho la Merced is the city's oldest standing structure.On January 8, 1847, the Battle of Rio San Gabriel took place in what are today parts of the cities of Whittier, Pico Rivera and Montebello.  The battle was a decisive victory for the U.S. Army, giving control of Los Angeles and Alta California to the United States, and is viewed by historians as a critical juncture in the Mexican-American war.  Today the site is California State Historical Landmark #385; and there are two cannons and a plaque commemorating the battle that overlook the river on Bluff Road and Washington Boulevard.Following the American Civil War, some 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of the East Los Angeles area was owned by Alessandro Repetto, an Italian immigrant settler from Genoa, Italy. Following Repetto's death in 1885, his brother sold his rancho to a consortium of five Los Angeles businessmen including banker Isaias Hellman and wholesale grocer/historian Harris Newmark for $60,000, approximately $12 per acre.  The land was later divided among the partners, one large parcel of approximately 2,000 acres (810 ha) going to a partnership of Newmark and his nephew, banker Kaspare Cohn. It was out of the Newmark and Cohn share of 1,200 acres (490 ha) that city Montebello had its beginnings in May 1899.  After receiving the advice of hydraulic engineer William Mulholland for the drafting and building of the town's water system, the land was subdivided.  In 1900 the completed water system was incorporated as the Montebello Land and Water Company.An area of 200 acres (81 ha) adjacent to the tracks of what was formerly the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad was developed into a townsite called Newmark, bounded by Los Angeles Avenue on the south, 1st Street on the east, Cleveland Avenue on the north, & 5th Street on the west.  The remainder of the land was subdivided into 5 acres (2.0 ha) lots suitable for small-scale agriculture.  On Mulholland's suggestion, Montebello was adopted as the city's name, replacing the original name Newmark.Originally an agricultural community, Montebello was formerly known for its prolific production of flowers, berries, fruits, and vegetables.  The first public flower show was sponsored by the Montebello Women's Club and held in the Montebello High School auditorium on Whittier Boulevard in 1912.  The Montebello â€“ El Carmel (South Montebello) Improvement Association, the predecessor of the Montebello Chamber of Commerce, operated from September 1907 to April 1912. with its stated purpose "to improve and beautify the community." Some of its early achievements included: seeing Whittier Boulevard paved, trees planted along the streets, establishment of the city's first high school, working to drop the name of "Newmark" and having the entire area incorporated as "The City of Montebello".  On October 19, 1920, the city was incorporated and its name officially changed to "Montebello".  In honor of Montebello's agricultural roots, the city's official seal contains a red poinsettia in the center. much of south Montebello, was populated by Japanese American farmers who would lose their property during the WW II internment of US citizens. many of the displaced residents were unable to return to their homes.

The Standard Oil Company discovered oil in the Montebello hills in 1917 on the Baldwin and Temple properties; this discovery changed the face of Montebello. What were formerly hills full of agriculture became oil fields.  Eventually, the oil taken from the soil in Montebello would produce one-eighth of the crude-oil in California. Over the course of sixty years, the Montebello hills were filled with producing oil wells.
