Maragogi is located on the Coral Coast – Costa dos Corais – 130 kilometers of continuous living tropical reefs on the coast of Northeast Brazil. The municipality is the second most visited city after Maceio the state capital of Alagoas.Its major attraction is the "Galés", a group of tropical pools formed at low tide about 6 kilometers from the city's beach. They are served by 15 large registered catamarans leaving from various points in the municipal area. Individual tours are also available.
In 2015 the city started to host sports events, with the launching of the first Trail Running competition on the region: the WINGSMAN Maragogi and then started to become the destination for adventure and outdoors tourism along with the traditional tourist looking for the best beaches in the country.  
Maragogi's history includes the battles between Dutch and Portuguese colonizers as well as the growth of the sugar cane and coconut plantations that formed the first wealth of the region. Today, it is tourism that provides the most important economic impact in the region. But, its potential remains unexplored. Even so, the busy waterfront in the City of Maragogi has a variety of restaurants, stores and stalls selling local arts and crafts.
Trips to snorkel or scuba dive the reefs can be interspersed by excursions on the reefs themselves or a sail (or even fish) on the local "jangada" sailing rafts. The deserted beaches of Maragogi and other rural attractions can be accessed by renting beach buggies readily available at the hotels and pousadas.
