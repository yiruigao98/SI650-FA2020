== History ==
The first settler in the region known today as Maple Heights was Benjamin Fitch, who arrived from Connecticut in 1813, ten years after Ohio became a state.  John Dunham came four years later in 1817, and built a road which still bears his name.  When the section of the Ohio and Erie Canal between Cleveland, Ohio and Akron was completed in 1827, Dunham Road provided access to the Canal.  The resulting traffic and trade stimulated further growth of the area.  The Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad opened a depot in northwestern Bedford Township in 1849, followed by the completion of the Connotton Valley Railroad in 1881.  Later that century, an electric-powered light rail system known as the Akron, Bedford, and Cleveland Interurban Line was completed.  The ABC line, as it was known, was in service from 1895 until 1932.  This rail service was instrumental in the growth and development of the southeastern Cleveland suburbs.  Longtime Maple Heights residents still refer to locations in the city by their numbered “stop” names from the days of the ABC line.
Maple Heights became an incorporated village in 1915 within the same boundaries that define it to this day.  The rapidly-growing population of Cleveland, many of whom were immigrants from Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and France, moved south during the early twentieth century, resulting in sufficient population to qualify for incorporation as a city in January 1932.  Following the Second World War, Maple Heights experienced a homebuilding boom that resulted in nearly all available land becoming developed into single family middle class housing by the early 1960s.  Population peaked by the 1970 census, and has been declining ever since.
Maple Heights was declared by the Auditor of State to be in fiscal emergency in 2015, but the city has been steadily improving its finances and budgeting since then.
