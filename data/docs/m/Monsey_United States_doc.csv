=== Jewish Community ===
Monsey is a major center of Orthodox Judaism in the United States, along with the neighboring towns of Kiryas Joel, Kaser, Spring Valley, New Square, and Airmont. It is the largest center of Hasidic Judaism in the United States outside of New York City, with approximately 5,400 households (4.2% of the world hasidic population). The migration to Monsey began in the late 1940s when New York City’s Orthodox Jews were seeking affordable real estate for their quickly growing communities. These spaces offered the possibility of moving en masse and establishing enclaves where they could lead lives based on halakha (Jewish religious law) without coming into regular conflict with their non-Orthodox neighbors. This represented a major, distinct suburban demographic shift for these communities. Major hasidic sects represented in Monsey include Satmar, Vizhnitz Monsey, and Belz, with tsadikim residents of the Berditchev, Lizensk, Lizensk (Rokeah), Nikolsburg, Sambor Yerushalayim-Monsey, Sassov, Shinave, Spinka Monsey, Stanislov, and Vizhnitz Monsey sects. On December 28, 2019, Monsey was the site of a mass stabbing in the home of a hasidic rebbe of the Koson sect who was hosting a Hanukkah party, leaving five injured.Orthodox Jewish residents of Monsey, and Rockland County more broadly, have been the subject of protests and discrimination from their non-Jewish neighbors, being blamed for overdevelopment, the systematic draining of public school budgets, zoning that is perceived as too dense for the suburban/rural character of the communities, anti-vaccination (leading to the rapid spread of measles), and refusal to adhere to social distancing requirements (leading to the rapid spread of COVID-19).
