Mirabel is an off-island suburb of Montreal, located in southern Quebec.
Mirabel is also the name of a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Mirabel. Its geographical code is 74.  Prior to 2002, Mirabel was not only a city but also comprised the Mirabel Regional County Municipality.
The city is home to Montréal-Mirabel International Airport.


== History ==

Mirabel was formed through the expropriation of private lands and the merger of 8 municipalities in 1971. The former municipalities were (with their individual founding dates in brackets): Saint-Augustin (1855); Saint-Benoît (1855); Saint-Hermas (1855); Saint-Janvier-de-Blainville (1855); Sainte-Scholastique (1855); Saint-Canut (1857); Sainte-Monique (1872), and Saint-Janvier-de-la-Croix (1959). Initially called Ville de Sainte-Scholastique but renamed Mirabel in 1973, the city was planned to become a vast transportation and industrial hub for Eastern Canada with Montréal-Mirabel International Airport at its centre.The airport, which opened in 1975, never became a major aviation hub and the industrial parks never materialized, and in 2004 the airport closed to all passenger traffic.
In 2000, about 10 square kilometres (4 square miles) of Mirabel's territory was annexed by Lachute.
