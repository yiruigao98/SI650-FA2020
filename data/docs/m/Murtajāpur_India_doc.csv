== School education ==
Murtizapur has schools from pre-primary to graduation in arts, science, and commerce. Still, there is a scope for colleges to provide education in engineering and medicine. There is clearly a lack of public interest in developing Murtizapur with respect to education. Local leaders need to put more efforts and focus in this area.
There are a lot of young citizens of Murtizapur who have left the town for education and employment and have settled in the metro areas of Maharashtra like Pune, Mumbai, and Nagpur. Several highly educated youths are even working abroad in Multinational companies.

== Healthcare ==
The town has primary healthcare centres run by the State Government and a few privately run clinics. The town still lacks good healthcare services.


== Economy ==
Mostly dependent on agriculture. Few small industries like oil mills and cotton pressing factories can be seen in MIDC. Town also has small traders in the market. Despite having good connectivity to the major cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad and Nagpur, one can see the lack of growth in this old town. Usually, people go to nearby cities like Akola, Paratwada and Amravati for shopping, medical facilities and purchase of automobiles.
