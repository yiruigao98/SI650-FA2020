== History ==


=== Early inhabitants ===
Human habitation of the Marchena area dates to prehistoric times at the third millennium BCE.In the eighth to seventh century BCE, a Phoenician community lived at Montemolin near Marchena.From the first millennium BCE, the Tartessian civilization gathered metals such as tin and gold from the waters of the Guadalquivir River and brought their culture to the area of Marchena. This may have included centres of ceremony and ritual.


=== Roman era ===
Around the 6th century BCE, the Carthaginians occupied Seville. Products of the area were transported to Carthage. In the late 3rd century BCE, forces of the Roman Empire under Publius Cornelius Scipio reached Seville. The region flourished under Roman rule for centuries. However, records of the time do not clearly identify the archaeological ruins about Marchena. Local authorities suggest they may include Castra Gemina, Cilpe and Colonia Marcia. Marchena fell into the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior and within that, in Hispania Baetica and within that, Hispalis (Seville).


=== Germanic tribes ===
As the Roman Empire declined, in the early 5th century CE the Vandals (a Germanic people), the Alans (an Iranian nomadic people of the North Caucasus), and the Suebi (another Germanic tribe) entered Spain from the north. In their division of Spain, Hispania Baetica fell to the Vandals. The Visigoths also invaded Spain from the north. They ruled Baetica from 497 CE to 711 CE. However, in comparison to the flourishing economy under Roman rule, under the Visigoths, the population decreased, agricultural endeavours were abandoned and once trading towns became small forts. Evidence for this change comes from the archaeological surveys of the kilns used for manufacturing amphora, and of olive presses and basins.


=== Muslim era ===
From 711 CE, in its weak state, the Visigoth Kingdom gave way to Muslim invaders from North Africa. In July 712 CE, Musa bin Nusayr, the provincial governor of northwest Africa, brought 18,000 men across the Strait of Gibraltar, paused at the fortress of Carmona, approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Marchena, and then took Seville. Iberia became part of the greater Umayyad Caliphate under Abd al-Rahman I (731 CE – 788 CE).
At the time of Muslim rule, Marchena was called Marsenah or "Marshana". Despite infighting between Arab clans and their associated Barber supporters, resident Arabic speaking Christians and Jews, Muslim Spain flourished. For example, Banu Jahwar Al-Marshaniyyun of the Hawwara clan lived in Marchena and was very wealthy. By the 12th century, Marchena was a medina (township) with a strong fortress and well defined systems of governance. It was part of the Almohad Caliphate until 1247 when the Christian forces of Ferdinand III of Castile (1199 CE – 1252 CE) took Marchena before laying Siege to Seville. Some Muslims were allowed to keep their homes and possessions while others, including some poets and writers, were forced to emigrate.


=== Christians ===
Until his death in 1309, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán (1256 – 1309) was the local ruler of Marchena. On 18 December 1309, Ferdinand IV of Castile (1285 – 1312) made Fernando Ponce de Leon the new local ruler of Marchena. He was the great-grandson of the king, Alfonso IX of León. Fernando's son, Pedro Ponce de León the Elder (died 1352) became the next Lord of Marchena. Pedro's son, Juan was the Lord of Marchena till his death by execution in Seville in 1367. Juan's brother then inherited the position but died in 1387.
In 1482, Queen Isabella I of Castile created the title of "Duke of Arcos" which was bestowed on Rodrigo Ponce de León, Duke of Cadiz (1443 – 1492). Rodrigo was the seventh Lord of Marchena.


=== Ponce de Leon family ===
In the late part of the 15th century and the early part of the 16th century, southern Spain was afflicted with epidemics of plague. Nonetheless, Marchena remained a prosperous town from the 15th to the 18th centuries due to the patronage of the Ponce de Leon family and their descendants.


=== Peninsular war ===
Between 1807 and 1814, Spain was consumed in the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic wars. In 1808, the first volunteer infantry regiment of Marchena was raised. In 1809, Brigadier General John Downie in command of the Royal Extremadura Legion liberated Marchena from the French.


=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, Marchena as part of Andalusia, went through an era of poverty. This was due to the loss of trade of produce with Spain's colonial lands; the giving of land to war heroes; and political unrest. In 1857, the population of Marchena was 13,005. Workers from agrarian centres like Marchena, moved to industrialised areas.


=== 20th century ===
On the background of the weak military dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1870 – 1930) the Spanish Constitution of 1931 was ratified. However, Seville province became a focus of communist and anarchist activity. In Marchena, the premises of the town's branch of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour) were paid for by local landowners. The CNT worked to organise the various trade unions. Local labour arbitrators accepted the CNT conditions for maintaining working conditions and protecting day labourers. One of the leaders of the socialist movement in the region was Mariano Moreno Mateo (a lawyer and forensic psychiatrist) of Marchena. In the general elections of 1931, the socialist, republican and leftist parties defeated the monarchist and right wing parties.
From 1936, Francisco Franco (1892 – 1975) led the Bando nacional through the Spanish civil war to become dictator until his death. Franco made Seville his first base of operations. Suspected opponents in the area, including those in Marchena, were rousted and killed.
