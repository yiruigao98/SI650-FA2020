== History ==
In 1868 Brisbane man George Raff bought some of the land held by the failed Caboolture Cotton Company, calling it "Moray Field", derived from Raff's native Morayshire in Scotland. It was often written as "Morayfields" and, from 1881, became "Morayfield".Caboolture State School opened in present-day Morayfield on 4 August 1873. In 1890 it was renamed Caboolture South State School and in 1908 it was renamed Morayfield State School. (The present Caboolture State School in Caboolture originally opened in 1889 and was then known as Caboolture North State School).Morayfield State High School opened on 27 January 1981.Until the mid-1980s, Morayfield remained a rural area consisting of a small dairy holding and small crop farming enterprises. However, with the population pressure caused by the rapid growth of the greater Brisbane area, it has since suffered to some degree from random or unplanned residential development and rapid population growth. It is a thriving retail and service industry commercial center.
Morayfield East State School opened on 29 January 1991.Minimbah State School opened on 28 January 1997.In January 2011 parts of Morayfield were flooded during the 2010-2011 Queensland floods.
