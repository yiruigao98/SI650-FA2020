Mandan is a city on the eastern border of Morton County and is the seventh-largest city in North Dakota. Founded in 1879 on the west side of the upper Missouri River, it was designated in 1881 as the county seat of Morton County. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the 2019 population at 22,752. Located across the Missouri River from the state capital of Bismarck, Mandan is a core city of the Bismarck-Mandan Metropolitan Statistical Area.


== Naming ==
The city was named after the historic indigenous Mandan of the area. The Mandan are now part of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, spanning the upper Missouri River in the western part of the state. Their people also live in cities of the state and other areas. In the 2010 census, nearly five percent of the people in the city of Mandan identified as Native American.The Mandan Indian village located at the southern base of Crying Hill prominent in east Mandan today was recorded as early as 1738 and referred to as the village of Good Fur Robe, named after their chief.  This settlement would also be recorded as the village of the Crying Hill as well the village of the Two Face Stone, after their corresponding geographic features. The village was one of six Mandan villages on the west river bank between today's Knife River and Cannonball River.The credit for the city's incorporated name is a point of debate. John Andrew Rea originally arrived across the river in Bismarck in 1876 to serve as temporary editor of its newspaper during one of its founder's extended absences. Rea subsequently served as the register in the governmental land office in the territorial capital of Bismarck for eight years starting in June 1880. Rea claimed he and Northern Pacific Railroad engineer Thomas L. Rosser created the name.  Rea would write to the St. Paul Pioneer Press which published and popularized the name which remains in use today. However, the more generally accepted version of the truth gives credit for the city's name to Frederic Gerard.  Gerard had married Helena Catherine, an Arikara/Ree woman when he ran the Fort Berthold trading post. Gerard was appointed by the Dakota Territorial governor as Morton County's first assessor when it was established in March 1878. He was one of the first three men elected as a Morton County Commissioner in November 1878.

=== Early history ===
While Native Americans had long established settlements in the area along the river, the first white explorer was Frenchman Sieure de la Verendyre and his expedition in 1738.  Not until the early 1800s did Euro-American frontiersmen come to the area with any regularity; the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804 and 1806, George Catlin in 1832 and Prince Maximilian and Karl Bodmer in 1834 being the most notable. The Fort Clark Trading Post was established in 1830 by the American Fur Company 40 miles upstream on the Missouri River to support trappers.  To provide protection for the approaching rail line from the east and the homesteaders who would surely follow, the US Army established two outposts in the area in 1872 and 1873.  Fort Greeley (later renamed Fort Hancock) was founded first on the east side of the river.  On the west side, an infantry post named Fort McKeen was constructed on bluffs above the confluence of Heart and Missouri Rivers. In 1873 Congress authorized the addition of a cavalry post and changed its designation to Fort Abraham Lincoln when foot soldiers were deemed ineffective against their mounted adversaries. A permanent civilian settlement known as "Lincoln" was adjacent to the north side of the fort.
When the Northern Pacific Railroad announced a pending river crossing in 1872, land speculators rushed to establish claims at probable locations for the inevitable city to be established on the west side of the crossing.  But due to the national financial crisis in 1873, Northern Pacific would postpone the river bridge project. Once its final location was announced approximately five miles north of Fort Abraham Lincoln, a work camp appeared on the west river bank in December 1878 complete with its own post office. The settlement would also serve as the base for the westward survey of the rail line.
On March 3, 1879, the post office was moved from the west bank of the Missouri River to the railroad's city site within blocks of Mandan's first railroad depot and freight building at Main Street and Stark Avenue (today's Collin's Avenue.) Four city names coincided exactly with four postmasters. The original railroad work camp's post office in 1878 was known as "Morton." The name "Mandan" stuck for only eight days in March 1879 before being renamed "Cushman" by a postmaster with an identical surname. Eventually in September 1879, the post office returned to its current designation of "Mandan."The City of Mandan was formally incorporated on February 24, 1881 and was named for the Mantani Indians, or "people of the bank." Mandan became the county seat for the replatted Morton County after the North Dakota legislature restored the prior county boundaries 1881 after the land grab in 1879 by Burleigh County. The city of Lincoln had been county seat from 1878 through 1879.
Upon completion of the railroad to Montana in 1881, Fort Abraham Lincoln had fulfilled its primary purpose and gradually declined until formally abandoned in 1891. The City of Lincoln eventually dwindled into obscurity.


=== Transportation development ===

In the earliest days of Euro-American settlement, the main commercial transportation route was the Missouri River.  Even after the rail arrived in the 1870s, the river remained the main north/south route until the mid-1930s with the development of the national highway system. Steamboats used coal for fuel and the mine at Sims seven miles west of Mandan was a major source of lignite coal. If unavailable, steamboat crews bought wood from farmers along the river.  Bellows Landing, the site of today's R M Hesket Power Station, was a refueling station with an icehouse.  Historical records indicate it served steamboat traffic as early as 1832 when the riverboat Yellowstone reached Fort Union.  Regular steamboat service on the Missouri began in 1860. Bellows Landing was renamed "Rock Haven" when the US government took over the operation in the late 1870s.  The Army Corps of Engineers made extensive riverside improvements, including adding dry-dock and boat repair facilities. It supported the supply ships for the US Army's frontier forts and was considered the best landing on the river.  Unlike most river harbors, the area was permanent and safe even during spring river ice breakup. It would cease operations in 1934.

However, the city continues to support the agricultural industry with livestock sale ring, farm implement dealers and suppliers and finance/lending institutions. But its original purpose was support for the railroad. Subsequent access to rail transportation allowed the agricultural, commercial and industrial sectors to flourish.
In recent decades, Mandan has diversified its economy to include food processing, petroleum refining, electrical power generation, software development, manufacturing and retail trade as well as all manner of professional services for its residents. One federal institution as well as one state institution border the city.

The origin for the city was to support the operation of the Northern Pacific Railroad.  First platting documents were filed in 1873.  A rail division headquarters and major maintenance facility was established in Mandan in 1881 to support operation from the Missouri River west to the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana.  The Northern Pacific became part of the 1970 merger into the Burlington Northern Railroad; in 1995 part of the new Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway.
