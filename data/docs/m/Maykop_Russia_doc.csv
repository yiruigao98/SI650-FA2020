the Imperial Russian Army built a military fort at Maykop in 1857.In 1910 oil deposits were discovered in the vicinity of Maykop.In 1936, Maykop and the surrounding region merged with Adyghe Autonomous Oblast and became the administrative centre of the autonomy. The Wehrmacht occupied Maykop on August 9, 1942 without a fight as a result of a Brandenburger commando operation.
