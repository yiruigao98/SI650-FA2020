Mahanoro is a city and rural commune located in the Atsinanana region of eastern Madagascar, along the coast.
It is located 9 km north of the mouth of the Mangoro River.  The Canal des Pangalanes is nearby, and the "Chutes de la Sahatsio" waterfalls are 18 km north of town.  Though a small airport is situated on the north side of the town, the location is quite isolated and with limited tourism, though it is reported to have a single hotel.The town's name means "who makes happy."There is a lighthouse on a cape just south of the town, constructed in 1936, and in poor repair.
