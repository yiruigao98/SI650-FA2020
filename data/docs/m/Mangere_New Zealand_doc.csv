Mangere (officially Māngere; Māori pronunciation: [ˈmaːŋɛɾɛ]), is one of the largest suburbs in Auckland, in northern New Zealand. It is located on mainly flat land on the northeastern shore of the Manukau Harbour, to the northwest of Manukau City Centre and 15 kilometres south of the Auckland city centre. It is the location of Auckland Airport, which lies close to the harbour's edge to the south of the suburb.
Mangere has two major sub-areas: Mangere Bridge and Māngere East, with Favona (in the east) sometimes counted as part of Mangere as well.
The suburb is named after Māngere Mountain, one of Auckland's largest volcanic cones. The cone's name comes from the Māori phrase hau māngere, meaning "lazy winds", after the shelter the mountain provides from the prevailing westerly wind. In 2019, the name of the suburb was officially gazetted as Māngere.

== Transport ==
The original Mangere Bridge was built to link Mangere with Onehunga to its north while the isthmus of Auckland reaches its narrowest point, further to the east at the former Auckland City suburb Ōtāhuhu. Later, it provided a more direct route for traffic to and from Auckland Airport. Construction of a new bridge was the subject of one of New Zealand's longest-running industrial disputes, from 1978 until 1980. The bridge was finally completed in 1983. The Southwestern Motorway (State Highway 20), one of the two motorways running south from the isthmus, runs across the bridge and through Mangere.
Passenger train Southern and Eastern Line services run along the eastern edge of Mangere, stopping at Middlemore railway station. Further north at Massey Road is Mangere railway station, closed in 2011.
Frequent bus services (15 mins schedules) connect Māngere Town Centre to Sylvia Park via Otahuhu railway station (route 32) and to Botany Town Centre via Papatoetoe railway station and Ōtara (route 31). Connections can be made with Onehunga, Auckland Airport and Manukau Bus Station on (route 380) Note: The 313 runs on a more direct route between Onehunga, Māngere, Papatoetoe and Manukau but services are at 30 min frequencies.
