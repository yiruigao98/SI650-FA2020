The rivers of India play an important role in the lives of the people. They provide potable water, cheap transportation, electricity, and the livelihood for many people nationwide. This easily explains why nearly all the major cities of India are located by the banks of rivers. The rivers also have an important role in Hindu Religion and are considered holy by all Hindus in the country.Seven major rivers along with their numerous tributaries make up the river system of India. The largest basin system of the rivers pour their waters into the Bay of Bengal; however, some of the rivers whose courses take them through the western part of the country and towards the east of the state of Himachal Pradesh empty into the Arabian Sea. Parts of Ladakh, northern parts of the Aravalli range and the arid parts of the Thar Desert have inland drainage.
All major rivers of India originate from one of the following main watersheds:

Aravalli range
Himalaya and Karakoram ranges
Sahyadri or Western Ghats in western India
Vindhya and Satpura ranges and Chotanagpur plateau in central IndiaHimalayan glaciers in the Indian subcontinent are broadly divided into the three river basins, namely the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. The Indus basin has the largest number of glaciers (3500), whereas the Ganga and Brahmaputra basins contain about 1000 and 660 glaciers, respectively. Ganga is the largest river system in India. However, these rivers are just three among many. Other examples are Narmada, Tapi, and the Godavari. The major west-flowing rivers are Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, Sutlej, Luni, Sabarmati, Mahi, Narmada and Tapi. Major east-flowing rivers are Ganga, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna, Mahanadi, Cauvery, Penneiyar, Vaigai, and Subarnarekha.


== The Indo-Gangetic plains ==
The Indo gangetic plains are known as Ganga-Satluj Ka Maidaan (गँगा सतलुज का मैदान), this area is drained by 16 major rivers. The major Himalayan Rivers are the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra. These rivers are long, and are joined by many large and important tributaries. Himalayan rivers have long courses from their source to sea (in India Arabian sea and Bay of Bengal).


== Aravalli Range River System ==
Following rivers flow from the Aravalli range, both northwards to Yamuna as well as southwards to Arabian Sea.

North-to-south flowing rivers, originate from the western slopes of Aravalli range in Rajasthan, pass through the southeastern portion of the Thar Desert, and end into Gujarat.
Luni River, 495 kilometres (308 mi) originates in the Pushkar valley near Ajmer, ends in the marshy lands of Rann of Kutch.

The major rivers in this system are (in order of merging, from west to east)

Ganga - 2,704 kilometres (1,680 mi) Starting from Gangotri Glacier, Uttarakhand, India
Chambal - 1,024 kilometres (636 mi) Flows through Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and merges into Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh
Betwa - 676 kilometres (420 mi) Not Himalayan river, covers Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh before merging Yamuna
Yamuna - 1,376 kilometres (855 mi) Yamuna runs its most of the course parallel to Ganga before contributing its water to Ganga at Prayagraj. Largest of Ganga's southern tributaries

Brahmaputra - 3,969 kilometres (2,466 mi) Merges with Ganga to form the grand river (but short in length) - Padma in Bangladesh. By now, flow velocity of both rivers slow down to considerable extent as they are in plains now.Before entering Bangladesh, near Farakka in Malda District, Ganga leaves a distributary Hoogly, 450 kilometres (280 mi) which provides water for irrigation in West Bengal


== Brahmaputra River System ==
The Brahmaputra river originates / starts from TIBET in China.
Yarlung Tsangpo River - 2,809 kilometres (1,745 mi) originates and forms the upper stream of Brahmaputra in Tibet
Siang - 184 kilometres (114 mi) main river after it enters India in the state of Arunachal Pradesh
Dibang - major tributary flowing through Arunachal Pradesh before merging into the Brahmaputra River in Assam
Lohit - one of the three major tributaries of Brahmaputra flowing through Arunachal Pradesh from the easternmost India
Brahmaputra - 780 kilometres (480 mi) runs across the state of Assam from East to West, entering Bangladesh afterwards
Teesta - 324 kilometres (201 mi) one of the largest tributaries of Brahmaputra; originating in the borders of Sikkim and Tibet, flowing South it joins Brahmaputra in Bangladesh

Padma River - 204 kilometres (127 mi) the Jamuna river merges with Padma in Bangladesh before finally falling into the Bay of Bengal
Brahmaputra has Total length of 3,969 kilometres (2,466 mi) as per latest mapping.


== Indus River System ==
The Indus River originates in the northern slopes of the Kailash range near Lake Manasarovar in Tibet. Although most of the river's course runs through neighbouring Pakistan, as per as regulation of Indus water treaty of 1960, India can use only 20 percent of the water in this river. A portion of it does run through Indian territory, as do parts of the courses of its five major tributaries, listed below. These tributaries are the source of the name of the Punjab of South Asia; the name is derived from the panch ("five") and aab ("water"), hence the combination of the words (Punjab) means "land with the water of five rivers". The Indus is 3,249 kilometres (2,019 mi) long.
The major rivers in Indus river system are (in order of their length):

Indus - 3,249 kilometres (2,019 mi)
Sutlej - 1,600 kilometres (990 mi)
Chenab - 960 kilometres (600 mi)
Jhelum - {{}}
Ravi - 729 kilometres (453 mi)
Beas - 484 kilometres (301 mi)
Shyok - 216 kilometres (134 mi)
Zanskar - 196 kilometres (122 mi)
Galwan - 138 kilometres (86 mi) tributary of Shyok


== Annual flows and other data ==
India experiences an average precipitation of 1,170 millimetres (46 in) per year, or about 4,000 cubic kilometres (960 cu mi) of rains annually. Some 80 percent of its area experiences rains of 50 inches (1,300 mm) or more a year. However, this rain is not uniform in time or geography. Most of the rains occur during its monsoon seasons (June to September), with the northeast and north receiving far more rains than India's west and south. Other than rains, the melting of snow year round over the Himalayas feeds the northern rivers to varying degrees. The southern rivers, however experience more flow variability over the year. For the Himalayan basin, this leads to flooding in some months and water scarcity in others. Despite extensive river system, safe clean drinking water as well as irrigation water supplies for sustainable agriculture are in shortage across India, in part because it has, as yet, harnessed a small fraction of its available and recoverable surface water resource. India harnessed 761 cubic kilometres (183 cu mi) (20 percent) of its water resources in 2010, part of which came from unsustainable use of groundwater. Of the water it withdrew from its rivers and groundwater wells, India dedicated about 688 cubic kilometres (165 cu mi) to irrigation, 56 cubic kilometres (13 cu mi) to municipal and drinking water applications and 17 cubic kilometres (4.1 cu mi) to industry.According to 2011 report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, India's basin wise distribution of catchment area and utilizable surface water resources is presented in the following table:


== The peninsular river system ==
The main water divide in peninsular rivers is formed by the Western Ghats, which run from north to south close to the western coast. Most of the major rivers of the peninsula such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make delta at their mouths. The Narmada, Periyar and Tapti are the only long rivers, which flow west and make estuaries.
