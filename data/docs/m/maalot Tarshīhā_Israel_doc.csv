== History ==


=== Tarshiha ===
Excavations of a 4th-century burial cave in the village unearthed a cross and a piece of glass engraved with a menorah.Crusader sources from the 12th and 13th century refer to Tarshiha as Terschia, Torsia, and Tersigha. The King had initiated the settlement of Crusader (Latin, Frankish) people in nearby  Mi'ilya ("Castellum Regis"), and from there settlement spread out to Tarshiha. In 1160, Torsia  and several surrounding villages were transferred to a Crusader named Iohanni de Caypha (Johannes of Haifa).
By 1217,  the village was probably inhabited by Crusader ("Frankish") people. In 1220   Joscelin III´s daughter  Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg,  sold their land, including  Tersyha, to  the Teutonic Knights. 
In 1266, Tarshiha was raided by Crusader troops.According to popular Arabic etymology, the name may have meant "Artemisia Mountain" in the Canaanite language, where Arabic Tuur for "mountain" and shiiH for Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort, or common wormwood) could be identified, or from Taar shiiHaa ("Shiha flew"), i.e. Shiha Jamaluddin (a legendary hero) rushed to the battlefield to fight the Crusaders.


==== Ottoman era ====
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with the rest of Palestine, the village of Tarshiha was raided by the Lebanese feudal chief, Mansur ibn Furaykh in 1573. The daftar of 1596 show the village to be under the administration of the nahiya of Akka, with a population of 107 households ("khana") and 3 bachelors, all Muslim. The inhabitants paid taxes on "occasional revenues",  bees and goats. The village was also taxed for a press, used either of olives or for grapes.Total revenue was 17,660  akçe.In the early eighteenth century, the village was under control of Shaikh Husayn, while later in the Ottoman period it became one of the  major cotton-producing villages of Galilee, and the administrative center of the nahiya.  Mariti visited the village (which he called Terschia) in 1761, and  wrote that it "abounds with water; which adds greatly to the fertility of its cotton plants, its fruit-trees, and above all its tobacco".Victor Guérin, who visited in 1875, found that Tarshiha "consists of four quarters, under the jurisdiction of as many different sheikhs. There are 2,000 Moslems, who have their mosques. The Christians occupy their own quarters: with the exception of a few families they are all United Greeks, and number about 500." In 1881  the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described Tarshiha  as: "a very large village, containing about 1,500 Moslems and 300 Christians; there is a fine mosque with minarets newly built, also an old one; the houses are well-built; a new and handsome church has been built in the Christian quarter".A population list from about 1887 showed  Tarshiha to have  about 4,855 inhabitants; 4,000 Muslims and 855 Christian.


==== British Mandate era ====

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tarsheha had a population of 1,880 residents; 1,521  Muslims, 358 Christians and 1 Druze,   where the Christians were 298  Melkite, 53 Orthodox and 7 Church of England. The population had increased in  the 1931 census to a total of 2522;   2047 Muslims  and 475  Christians, in a total of 584 houses.In the 1945 statistics the population of Tarshiha was  3,840; 3140 Muslims and  690 Christians. The total population of Tarshiha combined with Al-Kabri was 5,360 Arabs, with 47,428 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 743  dunums of land in the two places was used for citrus and bananas, 5,301 were plantation and irrigable land, 14,123 for cereals, while  252 dunams were built-up (urban) land.


===== 1947-48 war =====
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Tarshiha served as the headquarters of Fawzi al-Qawuqji, who headed the Arab Liberation Army. Tarshiha was in the territory allotted to the Palestinians under the 1947 UN Partition Plan.


==== State of Israel ====
In the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the village was captured by the Israel Defense Forces in Operation Hiram. The village was bombed by three Israeli planes on the evening of 28 October. This was followed by a prolonged artillery barrage and a further air raid in the morning with the village defenders and most of the inhabitants retreating north into Lebanon. The village was captured by the Israel Defense Forces on October 29. A UN observer reported that on 1 November 1948 the Arab villages around Tarshiha were deserted and extensively looted by Israeli forces. The New York Times added that the looting appeared systematic, as Israeli army trucks were used carrying off the looted goods. By December 1948 around 700 villagers, mostly Christians, had returned to the village.Any Arab who had not registered, as of November 1948, was regarded as illegal and if caught deported. An American Quaker relief worker with the American Friends Service Committee described a raid on Tarshiha on 15 January 1949. All males over sixteen were questioned by a panel of eight Israelis. 33 heads of families and 101 family members, aged 1 year to 79 years, were selected for deportation. They were robbed and expelled via 'Ara to Jenin. A UN observer in Jenin reported that their homes were being re-populated by large numbers of Jewish refugees from Austria. In December 1949 the Israeli Foreign Ministry blocked an IDF plan to clear Tarshiha and five other villages along the Lebanon border of their remaining Arab populations in order to create an 5 to 10 kilometres (3 to 6 miles) Arab-free zone. Arabs in the Galilee remained under Martial Law until 1966.


=== Ma'alot ===

Ma'alot was established as a development town for Jewish immigrants from Romania, Iran and Morocco, in 1957. The first homes were built on Har HaRakafot (Cyclamen Hill), known in Arabic as Bab Al-Hauwa ("Gate of the Winds").


=== Ma'alot-Tarshiha merger ===
In 1963, Ma'alot was merged with the larger Tarshiha, and the unified town was renamed to reflect both origins. The inhabitants of Tarshiha hoped that the merger would improve the level of services.
On 15 May 1974, an elementary school in Ma'alot was attacked by terrorists of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine in what became known as the Ma'alot massacre. Twenty-two teenagers and three teachers from Safed on a class trip were murdered in the attack. They had been sleeping on the floor inside the building. In addition, three Israeli women, one of them seven months pregnant, one four-year-old child, and two men were killed by the same terrorists in the events before the murder of the school children.Ma'alot-Tarshiha was officially recognized as a city in 1996.
Nearly 700 Katyusha rockets landed in the vicinity of Ma'alot-Tarshiha during the Second Lebanon War. Three Arab residents of the city were killed in a rocket attack.

Victor Guérin, after his 1875 visit, wrote that the principal mosque in Tarshiha had been built by Abdullah Pasha, (the Governor of Acre at the time.) He further noted that it was  "preceded by a court, then by a porch; surmounted by a cupola, above which springs an elegant minaret." Andrew Petersen, who inspected the mosque in 1993, noted that it was built in "classical Ottoman style with four main elements: a courtyard, an arcade, a domed prayer hall, and a minaret."
