Malvern East is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 13 km south-east of Melbourne's Central Business District, located within the City of Stonnington local government area. Malvern East recorded a population of 21,707 at the 2016 Census.
Malvern East is bounded to the north by Wattletree Road and Gardiners Creek, to the east by Warrigal Road, to the south by the Princes Highway (Dandenong Road) and to the west by Tooronga Road.
It is most famous for the Chadstone Shopping Centre, the largest shopping centre in the southern hemisphere, and the largest by total lettable space under one roof.In recent times, what was once a relatively small suburb was extended to incorporate parts of neighbouring Chadstone. Based on its easterly proximity to Malvern, the expansion and redefinition of Malvern East was driven in the 1990s by resident groups eager to 'reclaim' their address from being identified with the Chadstone Shopping Centre, which had been massively expanded since its original construction. However, the Chadstone Shopping Centre shares the 'Malvern East' address and postcode.
