Miyoshi merged with neighboring villages in 1906 to reach its present geographic borders and was raised to town status on April 1, 1958. During 2003–2005, discussions were held to merge Miyoshi with the city of Toyota, but the merger proposal was strongly opposed by the majority of the inhabitants of Miyoshi. As a result, the merger did not take place, and instead Miyoshi was elevated to city status on January 4, 2010. With its change in status, Miyoshi changed the spelling of its name from kanji (三好) to hiragana (みよし)
