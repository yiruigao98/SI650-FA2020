In the United States, inner suburbs (sometimes known as "first-ring" suburbs) are the older, more densely populated communities of a metropolitan area with histories that significantly predate those of their suburban or exurban counterparts. Most inner suburbs share a common border with the principal city of the metropolitan area and developed along railroad or streetcar lines radiating from the principal city (or at ferry termini, if at water borders).
