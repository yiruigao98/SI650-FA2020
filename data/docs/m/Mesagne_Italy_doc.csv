Mesagne (Mesagnese: Misciàgni) is a comune in the province of Brindisi and region of Apulia, on the south-east Italy coast. Its main economic activities are tourism and the growing of olives and grapes. It is the fifth most-populous town of the province, and it is 15 kilometres (9 mi) from Brindisi.


== History ==
Mesagne was an important center when Apulia was dominated by the Messapi, because it joined Oria to the port of Brindisi. After the Roman conquest, it was also an important city located on the Appian way. Its name is from these times. In the Middle Age it was called Castrum Medianum, then Castro Misciano, this is the name used from the 16th century. When Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo decided to expend the city's castle, Mesagne evolved, with the construction of a theater, a hospital and the paving of roads. The city remains important in the economy of the province to this day, with much industry in the area.
