== History ==


=== Overview ===
The origins of the city go all the way back to prehistory, with the first human settlement being near the hill where the castle is today. For this reason and the rugged topography of this region, the historical district has steep and narrow roads, but newer sections of the city to the west and northwest have more standard sized roads. Much of the architecture in the city is listed under the categories of Bien de Interés Cultural and conjunto histórico, categories that are part of Spain's national system of heritage listing.


=== Etymology ===
After the Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula, this placed was called Maurorum, which was a reference to the large population from North Africa. During the Moorish rule of the Iberian Peninsula the Latin term evolved into Mawror, and finally Moron. Though generally less accepted, there is another theory that the name Moron, comes from the preromanesque word morr, translated as "rocky hill" or "rock." This has been justified by the rocky terrain around Moron.The phrase "de la Frontera" or "Of the Border" refers to the border with Granada, because it was a border town between Fernando III's 1240 Christian conquest of Iberia until the fall of the kingdom of Granada in the late fifteenth century.There are other cities with the same name in Spain, France, Argentina, Cuba, Venezuela, Peru and Mongolia.


== Economy ==
The economy of Morón is primarily based in the industries of construction, and the production of olive oil, cereals and preserved vegetables. The extraction of calcium oxide and, to a lesser extent tourism industry, are also important to the economy. With the development of the working population, more women have been incorporated into the labor market, increasing from 19.56% of women participating in 1981 to 41.42% in 2001. Most of the female workforce is employed in the sale of food and household goods. Many of these women are also employed by the olive industry part-time during the live harvesting season, both for making olive oil, and other olive products.


== Demographics ==
The last census by the national institute of statistics, released January 1, 2011, states that the city has 28 489 inhabitants. In the 20th century, the demographics of the city were affected similarly to other agrarian zones in the province. Remarkably, the population of Morón de la Frontera actually increased during the Spanish Civil War, but this shift also produced a larger ratio of women to men in the city due to the conscription of many military-age men. There was smooth population growth into the 1960s, which was then followed by a sudden decline due to the decreasing birth rate and emigration. Since the late 1980s, the city has maintained slow but stable population growth.

The figure of the horse was adopted in the fifteenth century. Though there are several legends about the origin of the figure, most historians agree it is a reference to a type of Berber horse. Nearby cities like Los Corrales, Coripe and Utrera also carry a horse on their shields. The coat of arms is completed with the crown of Henry II of Castile.The current design was adopted in the year 1970, and is attributed to the painter Joaquín Pascual Alemán. The horse's reins represent the desire for freedom. The figure is based on the equine figures present in the baroque paintings of Diego Velázquez.
