== History ==

Malden, a hilly woodland area north of the Mystic River, was settled by Puritans in 1640 on land purchased in 1629 from the Pennacook tribe. The area was originally called the "Mistick Side" and was a part of Charlestown. It was incorporated as a separate town in 1649. The name Malden was selected by Joseph Hills, an early settler and landholder, and was named after Maldon, England. The city originally included what are now the adjacent cities of Melrose (until 1850) and Everett (until 1870).
At the time of the American Revolution, the population was at about 1,000 people, and the citizens were involved early in resisting British rule: they boycotted the consumption of tea in 1770 to protest the Revenue Act of 1766, and it was also the first town to petition the colonial government to secede from the British Empire.Malden High School has the second-oldest continuous high school football rivalry in the United States with Medford High School.  The first "Thanksgiving Day Game" dates back to 1889.In 1984, Malden came to national renown as the location of the controversial Fells Acres Day Care Center preschool trial.In 2004, a same-sex Malden couple was the first to marry in Massachusetts at 9:15 am on May 17, 2004 at Cambridge City Hall.
