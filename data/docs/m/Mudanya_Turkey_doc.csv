According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Mudanya had a total population of 16.683, consisting of 11.792 Greeks and 4.891 Muslims. A port city, it also had a railway connection to Bursa which was completed in 1875. The railway had a pier at the seaport of Mudanya for exporting. Istanbul was often the recipient of exported goods from Mudanya. Silk was a popular export.The town was the signing place of the Armistice of Mudanya between Turkey, Italy, France and Britain on October 11, 1922, following the Turkish War of Independence.
After the Treaty of Lausanne and the Greco-Turkish population exchange agreement, the Greeks of the town were transferred into mainland Greece, establishing a settlement to which they gave the name of their previous town, Nea Moudania (New Moudania, located on the Chalkidiki peninsula, in the Macedonia region of Greece). In return, a number of Cretan Turks were settled in Mudanya.
