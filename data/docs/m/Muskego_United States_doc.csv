== History ==
The history of Muskego started originally as the home of the Potawatomi, who named it "Mus-kee-Guaac", which means "sunfish". The first European came in 1827 and a few years later (1833), the Potawatomi tribe ceded their lands in Wisconsin to the United States government. The first permanent settlers, coming from New Hampshire, were the Luther Parker family.Once an agricultural area, Muskego was incorporated as a city in 1964. When it became a city it included the unincorporated communities of Tess Corners and Durham Hill. With an increase in housing developments in the city, it has become a bedroom community for Milwaukee.
