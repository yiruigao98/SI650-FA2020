Muvattupuzha is a prominent old town in the midlands directly to the east of Kochi in Ernakulam district, Kerala. It is situated at around 36 km (22 mi) from downtown Kochi. The town is a growing urban centre in central Kerala. The town is also popular as the starting point of Muvattupuzha river which happens by the merging of three rivers – namely Thodupuzhayar (Thodupuzha river), Kaliyar (Kali river) and Kothayar (Kothamangalam river) – to form Muvattupuzhayaar. Thus, this Thriveni Sangamam or confluence of three rivers is called Muvattupuzha.
Muvattupuzha is a municipality in the eastern side of Ernakulam district in the Indian state of Kerala. The town is bordered by Kottayam district on the southern side and Idukki district on the eastern side approximately 20 km (12 mi) from the town. Muvattupuzha lies on the intersection between M C Road and National Highway 49, about 42 km (26 mi) from the district capital Ernakulam. Muvattupuzha is located 20 km (12 mi) from Thodupuzha, 17 km (11 mi) from koothattukulam and 5 km (3.1 mi) away from Arakuzha. It is the second biggest commercial centre of the district and one of the biggest in the central part of the state.


== Etymology ==
The town is named after the Muvattupuzha river which flows through it. The name is made up of three Malayalam words: Moonnu, which stands for three; aaru, small river; and puzha, which also means river. Aaru is a word that is usually used for rivers in the southern half of Kerala, while the term puzha is used in the northern parts. The three rivers in this case are the Kothamangalam river or Kothayaar, Kaliyar and Thodupuzhayar, which merge to form a single river called Muvattupuzhayar. This place is called Thriveni Sangamam in Malayalam which means the point of confluence of three rivers.In English both spellings viz. Muvattupuzha and Moovattupuzha are interchangeably used. Etymologically Moovattupuzha, is the correct spelling how ever commoners widely use the spelling Muvattupuzha and is better accepted.

== Geography ==
The town and western parts of the region are mainly plains and is culturally similar to Ernakulam whereas the eastern parts are mainly highlands and differ from the western parts as most of the region are agricultural areas. Essentially, the regions of Thodupuzha, Muvattupuzha and Kothamangalam were called sub-high range or Keezhmalanad of erstwhile Vadakkumkoor Kingdom indicating these as lands with fertile soils deposited by Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha rivers over a period of time due to floodings of the banks. While, Muvattupuzha and nearby areas are less hilly and fertile. The altitude is much lesser and the hilly region is the Kadalikkad-Meenkunnam-Pampakkuda curved region. Muvattupuzha, thus have vast flat lands and paddy fields spread even up to 30 km (19 mi) to the east till Vannappuram. The town is 20 m (66 ft) above mean sea level (MSL).
The term sub-highranges or "low ranges" is a subtle term used to indicate the towns of Thodupuzha and Palai. In fact, the low ranges towns lying in the foothills of Western ghats all along the SH 8 (Punaloor-Muvattupuzha road) meet the main interjunction at Muvattupuzha, which is the most strategically connected and accessible place in central Kerala. A total of 9 important roads meets here connecting to all directions.

=== Muvattupuzha river ===
The Muvattupuzha river (Malayalam: മൂവാറ്റുപുഴയാർ) which starts in the Idukki highranges and flows through Muvattupuzha town runs for 121 km (75 mi) and enters the Kottayam district. The major source of water is the Thodupuzha river which starts in the Idukki district and provides water throughout the year, enabled by the supply of water from Idukki arch dam. Idukki dam is the largest arch dam in India and it is used for hydro-electric power generation. This is an old heritage route all along the river's path up to Vaikom. Old settlements along the path of the Muvattupuzha river evolved into towns. These include Muvattupuzha, Vaikom, Thodupuzha, Piravom, Thalayolparambu etc. 70 or 80 years back, transportation was essentially through Kettuvallam (House boats) traveling to Vettikkattumukku and Vaikom to reach Alappuzha and through Poothotta  to reach Kochi. Before Kothamangalam and Thodupuzha evolved as prominent hill produce market, Muvattupuzha was the old centre owing to the connectivity through the river which was of prime importance in the yesteryears, when road transportation was in the infant stage. Muvattupuzha river is the prime victim of river pollution nowadays. Green People, an environmental organization is now leading a campaign to save the Muvattupuzha river. Companies like Hindusthan Newsprint Limited functions near the banks of this river but this company was having advanced effluent treatment
system but these days this system is not functioning as per expectation and the river water turns black where effluent joins river at pipeline junction.


=== Muvattupuzha Bridge ===
It was in 1914 when M Krishnan Nair was the Resident Diwan of Travancore, the first concrete bridge in Asia was built in Muvattupuzha under the supervision of the British engineer W.H. Emrald. It is said that on its inauguration, to convince the strength & stability of the bridge, Emrald and his wife sat beneath the bridge in a boat while 15 elephants walked over it. This bridge is across the Muvattupuzha river connecting Nehru Park and Kacherithazham.
There was a wooden bridge across the river through which the steam bus(കൽക്കരി വണ്ടി/കരിഗ്യാസ് വണ്ടി ) goes from Muvattupuzha to Ernakulam in olden days. The border to Cochin state was at Chungam, Mamala, near Thiruvankulam.
Until the late 1970s, traffic was through the old concrete bridge. There was a traffic police outpost on either side of the bridge to control one way traffic at a time through the narrow bridge.
Later in the 1970s, a new bridge was constructed and in the late 1970s the traffic diverted through this wider two way bridge.


=== Folklore ===
Kadamattathu Kathanar was a magician in this region who travelled Kerala to immobilize Yakshis (female demons).Theevettikkolla (തീവെട്ടിക്കൊള്ള) is a term that originated from Muvattupuzha.


=== Suburbs ===
In the olden days, there was a petrol pump in BOC junction. BOC is the short form for [Burmahshell Oil Company]. Later it is said that Jawaharlal Nehru addressed people in this junction(1958) and now called Nehru Park after his name. Muvattupuzha along with Aluva were the populated towns prior to the 1960s and hold huge importance. Petrol bunks, automobile workshops, electricity were available in Muvattupuzha much earlier than the neighbouring regions.
The town consists of two regions separated by the Muvattupuzha bridge. Kacherithazham is the main centre of the town to the east of the Muvattupuzha bridge. Nehru Park, Velloorkunnam and Vazhappilly are to the north of the bridge. TB.Junction and P.O Junction lies East of the bridge. Kavumkara is an old market which lies to the northeast of the town after the bridge on the Muvattupuzha–Kothamangalam road.

Kizhakkekara and Randaattinkara (Randarkara or Randar) lies on the eastern part of the town on the banks of the Muvattupuzha river. From the olden times, south of Marady (മാറാടി) panchayat towards Kottayam were sparsely occupied and still has old rubber plantations and a hilly terrain until Koothattukulam. Aaroor (ആറൂര്‍) (near Meenkunnam) was a forest before 5–6 decades. While every direction from Muvattupuzha is populated and almost urbanized, the southern direction towards Kottayam via M C Road is not so developed in terms of infrastructure. At a distance approximately 9 km (5.6 mi) southwards, Muvattupuzha town is covered by a curve-like hilly region of 40–60 m (130–200 ft) MSL in the whole southern side which crosses Kottayam and Piravom routes. Most of these hills are rubber plantations. KSTP's second phase project of straightening of the Muvattupuzha – Chengannur MC Road is recently inaugurated.
The old Muvattupuzha bridge built over the Muvattupuzha river was the first concrete bridge in Asia. It was completed in 1914. This serves as the connection between Nehru Park and Kacherithazham.
The nearby panchayaths are mostly into agriculture, small- and medium-scale industries. Pineapple and rubber plantations are the common agrarian efforts. Match box industries, plywood factories, saw mills, paper, plastic and wood carton making are the main industries in this area.

== Economy ==
Muvattupuzha taluk consists of midlands and highlands with agriculture and small-scale industries as its primary economic base. Muvattupuzha was a part of erstwhile Travancore Kingdom. The border check posts of Travancore in Mamala, near Thiruvankulam prevented interconnectivity between Kochi and Muvattupuzha. Muvattupuzha was an important commercial centre and a prominent town until about 1975. Two decades back a separate Muvattupuzha district was to be carved out of the districts Ernakulam, Idukki and Kottayam. Demand for Muvattupuzha District still exists. But the new district formation is not yet supported from Kerala government. Census of India, 2011 noted a new, separate and distinct urban agglomeration including parts of Muvattupuzha and Kothamangalam talukas. Lately, Kerala Government is supporting and considering the formation of Muvattupuzha district; but faces opposition from a regional party Kerala Congress (M). There is a strong lobby based on Thodupuzha who does not want to see realization of Muvattupuzha district. Their fear is, given the geographical proximity that Muvattupuzha enjoys as well as the biggest urban region in the central-eastern midlands makes Muvattupuzha grow into a major city in the eastern side of Kochi. Muvattupuzha-Kothamangalam will have the possibility of growing into a single city.  But Muvattupuzha still is a town with its own history and old glory being a major city in the central Kerala and the second biggest in the district.

== Infrastructure ==
Muvattupuzha is a part of Central Kerala. It lies between Angamaly and Kottayam on the Main Central Road which runs along the length of the old Travancore, from Thiruvananthapuram to Angamaly. The first and second longest state highways of Kerala, Main Central Road (Angamaly - Thiruvananthapuram / SH-01 / 240 km (150 mi)) and Main Eastern Highway (Muvattupuzha–Punalur / SH-08 / 154 km (96 mi)), meet here.  The Kochi–Madurai NH 49 passes through Muvattupuzha. A four lane road connecting the city to district center Kakkanad is proposed. Also the proposed Kakkanad-Thankalam (four lane) road connecting the Kochi city to eastern midlands of Kothamangalam passes through the suburbs of Muvattupuzha town. The Muvattupuzha–Theni Highway (SH 43) starts at the Chalikkadavu Bridge and goes through Randattinkara, Kotta, Udumbannoor, Nedumkandam and Cumbum before ending at Theni. This is a shorter route to Madurai in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.A bypass has been planned from Kadathy to Puthuppady to avoid traffic from the Kochi–Madurai NH 49 which is also the route to Munnar, a popular hill station. A bypass to Thodupuzha Road and MC Road is planned from Kadathi on NH49 via the proposed new bridge at Murikkallu. Later the road will join MC Road towards Kottayam at Marady. A Muvattupuzha–Kakkanad–Palarivattom four-lane highway project is at discussion levels. Proposed route is via Vazhappilly, Pattimattom, Kizhakkambalam, Infopark to Reach Vyttila Central Bus Terminal in 30 minutes over 31 km (19 mi). Chalikkadavu bridge helps long-distance travelers from being caught in traffic, particularly during the rush hour. The bypass will go through Kizhakkekara to Marady to link the SH-8 to Thodupuzha and to the MC Road.
