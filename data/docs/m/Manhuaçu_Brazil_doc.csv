The Caparaó National Park is a national park administered by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and is located approximately 60 km southeast of Manhuaçu on the boundary dividing the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo.  The entrance to the park is at Alto Caparaó.  The area of the park is 318 square kilometers.
It was created in 1961 by President Jânio Quadros.  It contains the third highest peak in the country, the Pico da Bandeira  (2,891 m). In 1859 Emperor Dom Pedro II had ordered that a flag of the Empire be placed on the highest peak of the Serra do Caparaó. It is believed that the name Pico da Bandeira is due to this fact.  The mountains of the Caparaó chain have landscapes of great beauty with numerous waterfalls and caverns. There are also other important peaks like Pico do Cristal (2769.7 m) and Pico do Calçado (2.766 m).
