== History ==
It was originally known as Pasir Rawa. In the late 19th century, Mentakab was a candidate for Pahang's new capital city, replacing Pekan. However, due to its mountainous terrain, Kuala Lipis was instead chosen as the capital of the state in 1898, later replaced by Kuantan in 1955.


== Transport ==


=== Rail ===
Mentakab has a railway station operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu. The railway station is on the East Coast Line of the KTM Intercity network, running from Gemas in Negeri Sembilan to Tumpat in Kelantan and goes through the railway station in Mentakab. Presently two trains stop at the station daily.


=== Road ===
Mentakab is connected to the constituency centre Temerloh via national highway . 
The original road from Kuala Lumpur to Kuantan (highway ) also goes through Mentakab which gives Mentakab an important role. Travelers used to recognize the famous round-about near Jalan Tun Razak-Jalan Temerloh intersection every time they reached the town. However, the iconic round-about has been replaced by a traffic light. The role of route 2 has now been superseded by the East Coast Expressway , which connects Gombak in Selangor to Kuala Terengganu.

Mentakab is a popular site for urban swiftlet farming; the top floor of many shoplots in the city are modified to provide space for swiftlet farming. Successful urban farming can be rewarding as each kilogram of swiflets' nest can be sold for as high as US$2000. However, few have succeeded and disadvantages towards urban residents can potentially outweigh economic gains such as widespread of diseases or bird flu and excessive bird droppings.
