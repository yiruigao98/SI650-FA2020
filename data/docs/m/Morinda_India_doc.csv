Morinda is a city with Municipal Council in Rupnagar District in the Indian state of Punjab.
Morinda is known in the local region for housing one of the 23 Co-operative Sugar Mills in the State of Punjab. It is also known as Baganwaala, "The City of Orchards". This is because Large Orchards occupied it once which were eventually cleared for housing.
The City is located on NH 95 (Connecting Chandigarh and Ludhiana). This benefits local businesses, enabling the town development and expansion. Today, Morinda grows at a faster rate than its neighbouring towns.  A lot of industries of nearby towns such as Bassi Pathana have moved to Morinda.
Adding to the historical significance of the town is Gurudwara Shri Kotwaali Sahib. This was the prison (Kotwali) where the Mother, Mata Gujri of 10th Sikh Guru (Guru Gobind Singh) and his two sons were kept as prisoners before being taken to Fatehgarh Sahib where the sons sacrificed their lives. They were buried alive in the walls and later Mata Gujri also ended her life at the same place.
