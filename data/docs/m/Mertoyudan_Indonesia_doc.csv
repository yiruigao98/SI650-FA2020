Hoegeng (born Iman Santoso; in Pekalongan on 14 October 1921 â€“ 14 July 2004) was Chief of the Indonesian National Police. Hoegeng was famously known as the bravest and most honest police officer in Indonesia by the media and the people. Hoegeng lived in an era when many government officials were corrupt. Abdurrahman Wahid, former president of Indonesia once praised Hoegeng's honesty, saying that "there are only 3 honest police in the country: speed bumps (polisi tidur, literally meaning sleeping police but refers to speed bumps), police statues, and Hoegeng". Hoegeng is one of the briefest people to head the Indonesian national police agency from 1968-1971.

=== Early life and education ===
Hoegeng was born in Pekalongan on 14 October 1921. His birth name was Iman Santoso. The name Hoegeng was taken from "bugel" (to "bugeng" and then "hugeng"; which means fat) due to his fat body as a child. His father was Soekarjo Kario Hatmodjo from Tegal, a prosecutor in Pekalongan; his mother was Oemi Kalsoem. He had two younger sisters: Titi Soedjati and Soedjatmi. Hoegeng wanted to be a policeman because he was influenced by his father's friend who was a chief of police in his hometown Ating Natadikusumah. Another law-related officer who was his father's friend was Soeprapto.Hoegeng enrolled at Hollandsch Inlandsch School (HIS; elementary school) Pekalongan and graduated in 1934. He then enrolled at Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO; middle school) in the same town and graduated three years later. He moved to Yogyakarta to continue his study at Algemene Middlebare School (AMS; high school) majoring in Western languages and literature. While at AMS, Hoegeng befriended his senior Burhanuddin Harahap, his classmate Soedarpo Sastrosatomo, and his juniors Usmar Ismail and Rosihan Anwar. In 1940, after graduating, he moved to Batavia continuing his study at Recht Hoge School (RHS; law college), although some of his family members wanted him to enrolled at Middlebare Opleidingschool Voor Inlandsche Ambtenaren (MOSVIA; civil service college). There he involved in student organization named Unitas Studiosorum Indonesiensis (USI). In the organization, he met Soebadio Sastrosatomo, Subandrio, Oemar Senoadji, Chairul Saleh, and Hamid Algadrie.In March 1942, Japanese occupied Dutch East Indies. Initially, Hoegeng felt relieved with the Japanese's arrival. But, then Japanese military closed the RHS. Hoegeng then returned home in April; he used his free time to sell eggs and Japanese school books traveling from one city to another including Pati and Semarang with his friend Soehardjo Soerjobroto. In Semarang, he met his relative and was offered to work at Hoso Kyoku radio station. He was accepted and began to work one month later. While working at the station, he enrolled to a police course opening in Pekalongan. Hoegeng then applied and was accepted as one of eleven members of police force out of 130 applicants.He joined the Marshall General School in Military Police School, Fort Gordon, Georgia, United States. In April 1942, he returned home because the RHS was closed by the Japanese. He sold eggs and Japanese language books with his friend to Pati and Semarang.


=== Early career ===
Hoegeng originally felt disappointed because he found out that the output of the course was not for high-ranking officers (second inspector), but two ranks lower. However, he still went through it. While in the training, Hoegeng received 32 IDR per month, 19.50 IDR net. Everyday after training, the cadets were assigned as regular police officers in the city. His colleagues, the trainers and fellow cadets, later became prominent high-ranking officers including Soemarto, Soehardjo Soerjobroto, Soerojo, and Soedjono Partokoesoemo. After graduating from the course, Hoegeng was hesitant whether to continue his career as policeman or slightly turn as a judge. During that time, Soemarto, his trainer, registered Hoegeng to police officer course in Sukabumi. Hoegeng then was accepted, even though he was not too serious at the selection, among six others from Pekalongan, alumnus of the earlier course.In Sukabumi, Hoegeng listed to Koto Kaisatsu Gakko course, a course for anyone who already trained in the police. Before graduation, Hoegeng and his friends thought that they would be promoted to higher rank named Junsabucho. On the contrary, their rank were to be lowered to Minarai Junsabucho. They protested heavily of the decision until General Harada of Sixteenth Army visited the place to calm them down. In 1944, Hoegeng graduated and with his three friends, Soetrisno, Noto Darsono, and Soenarto, were assigned to Chiang Bu (security department) of Semarang. Hoegeng and Soenarto held the Koto Kei Satsuka (intelligence division) post, while Noto and Soetrisno respectively were given position at Keimu Ka (general affairs) and Keiza Ka (economic affairs). After several weeks in Semarang, Hoegeng was promoted to Kei Bu Ho II. In the next several months, Hoegeng once again were promoted, this time to Kei Bu Ho I. Shortly before Japanese surrendered to Allied forces, Hoegeng were reassigned to Keibi Ka Cho (custody division) under the leadership of R. Soekarno Djojonegoro and was promoted again.One day after the proclamation, Soeprapto, friend of Hoegeng's father, gathered the police members, including Hoegeng and his superior Soekarno Djojonegoro, and told them about the independence of Indonesia and that there was to be a transfer of power. In October, Hoegeng was admitted to a hospital (now Karyadi Hospital) in Semarang after suffering concussion during his duty guarding Japanese prisoners. At that time, the Five Days Battle between Indonesian fighters and Japanese prisoners occurred. In the morning before the hospital was stormed by the Japanese, Hoegeng fled because he didn't like the hospital atmosphere and fled from the place he was treated. After the battle began to cease, Hoegeng was recommended by doctor to rest. He then took leave and rested in Pekalongan.While in Pekalongan, Hoegeng was visited by Commodore M. Nazir who was later to be the first Navy's chief of staff. Nazir interested in Hoegeng because he wanted to establish navy's military police and offered the latter to be a part of the navy. Hoegeng then accepted the offer mainly because he wanted a challenge as the police force was already well-established. As a military officer ranked Major, he was given the right to live at Hotel Merdeka, Yogyakarta, and paid 400 IDR per month. Under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Darwis, Commander of Navy Base in Tegal, his first duty was to formulate the basic foundation of the military police which was, at the beginning, named Penyelidik Militer Laut Khusus (PMLC; special navy investigator) unit. During living in the hotel, Hoegeng was persuaded by Soekanto Tjokrodiatmodjo, the chief police, to rejoin the police. In Yogyakarta, Hoegeng had another activity as a main character of a radio play Saija dan Adinda broadcast by Angkatan Laoet, Darat, dan Oedara radio (ALDO; navy, land, and air forces) and RRI Yogya. He later married his counterpart in the play, Merry, on 31 October 1946 in Jetis, Yogyakarta. After they married, Hoegeng resigned as the navy officer to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a police officer.


=== Indonesian independence and occupation by the Dutch ===
After rejoining, Hoegeng was listed as a student of Akademi Kepolisian (Police Academy) in Mertoyudan, Magelang. During his vacation in the middle of 1947, Hoegeng and his wife, who was pregnant, visited his family in Pekalongan. However, on 21 July the Dutch military conducted a military operation. Hoegeng and his family then fled to south of the town. Hoegeng was told by Soekarno Djojonegoro, chief police of Pekalongan, that Soekanto had ordered all of the students of the academy to help the local police department. Hoegeng's duty at that time was collecting intelligence material. Later, he was arrested by police officers who worked for NICA. While arrested, Hoegeng was treated well, unlike the others. He eventually found out that the one who gave the order was de Bretonniere, his friend in RHS. Hoegeng was persuaded to work for NICA but refused. After three weeks, he was released. Hoegeng then decided to visit the commando Yogyakarta. He, his wife, and his parents went to Jakarta at first. In Jakarta, Hoegeng met Soemarto who was a deputy chief police at that time and was asked to be the latter's subordinate. Hoegeng accepted but wanted to visit Yogyakarta. He was helped by Soemarto and left his wife and went alone in September. In Yogyakarta, Hoegeng reported his duty to Soekanto and requested for permission as Soemarto's subordinate in Jakarta; Soekanto gave the permission. In November, Hoegeng worked as Soemarto's assistant and was given duty to observe Indonesian political prisoners and help them if possible. In Jakarta, he corresponded with Sudirman, Hamengkubuwono IX, Oerip Soemohardjo, Suryadi Suryadarma, and M. Nazir.He was Chief of the DPKN police office in Surabaya, East Java in 1952. He became the chief of BARESKRIM in Medan, North Sumatra in 1956. In 1959, he followed the Mobile Brigade(BRIMOB) training school and became a directorate staff II in the national police headquarters in 1960, he became the chief of the Immigration & customs in 1960, became the Minister of Economics in 1965, and became the Ministry of Secretary in the main cabinet in 1966. After Hoegeng resigned as the police chief, he performed on TVRI playing Hawaiian guitar together with "The Hawaiian Seniors" band, and hosted The Hawaiian Seniors music show (originally Irama Lautan Teduh) from 1968 until 1979. Sometimes he performed with his wife, Merry Hoegeng and his daughter, Reny Hoegeng or Aditya Hoegeng.
