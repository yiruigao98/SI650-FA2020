Minbu (Burmese: မင်းဘူးမြို့) is a city in Magwe Division, Myanmar. As of 2014, the city has an urban population of 22,962. The area consists of low plain-land towards the Ayeyarwady River, and of undulating country inland rising higher and higher westwards towards the Arakan hills. Between the plain and the Arakan Yoma range is a distinct line of hills running north and south, and usually called the Nwa-Madaung hills. The submontane valleys are largely cultivated, but are deadly except to those born in them. The chief streams besides the Ayeyarwady are the Mon, the Maw, and the Salin, which are largely used for irrigation. At Minbu the Ayeyarwady is 3 miles (4.8 km) wide, with many islands and sandbanks. There are considerable fisheries along the Ayeyarwady and on the Paunglin Lake, which is a lagoon fed from the Ayeyarwady. Oil has been discovered near the mud volcanoes of Minbu, but it seems to lie at too great a depth to be profitably worked.
There is a large area of reserved forest near Minbu. The chief crops raised are rice, gram, millet, beans, peas, sesamum and tobacco. The betel-vine is largely cultivated along the Mon River. The annual rainfall varies greatly in the area. It is very considerable on and under the Arakari Yomas, and very slight towards the Ayeyarwady. The temperature rises to over 100 °F (38 °C) in the hot months, and the mean of minimum in December is about 49 °F (9 °C).

A pair of Buddha's footprints are located in Settawya, a forest retreat which is 34 miles (55 km) west of Minbu on the opposite bank of Magwe and is 331 miles (533 km) from Yangon by road.

On the way from Minbu, visitors can pay homage to Sandalwood Monastery at Legging where the Lord Buddha had visited in his lifetime. The history of that Footprint Pagoda dated back to the time of Buddha. Once the Lord Buddha came to that site in the country of Sunapranta. He met the Orahat Sicca Vanda and Naga Nammada on his way and on their humble request, the lord granted their reverence. The footprints were enshrined ever since. The lower footprint on the slat is under water during the monsoon months as the river Man is flooded. Therefore, the festival is celebrated in the later winter months. Minbu is very hot in summer.
