== History ==

Formerly known as Marseille–Marignane Airport, it has been managed since 1934 by the Marseille-Provence Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI).In the 1920s and 1930s, Marignane was one of France's main points of operation for flying boats. It even briefly served as a terminal for Pan American World Airways Clipper flying boats. Other flying boat operators were Aéropostale and Air Union, the latter moving over from Antibes in 1931. Marignane was also a production site for hydroplanes by Lioré et Olivier.Antoine de Saint-Exupery describes turning back to Marignane airport with a fuel leak in chapter 8 of “Wind, Sand and Stars”, before setting out again for Tunis, and the fateful event that informed his later description of the crash-landing in his best-known book, “The Little Prince”.
In September 2006, the airport opened its new terminal MP2 for budget airlines.  In 2013 the airport expanded its shopping and dining options, with 30 new shops and restaurants, among which is the first Burger King restaurant in France since 1997.
