Maştağa (also, Mashtaga, Mashtaghy, and Mashtagi) is a settlement and municipality in Baku, Azerbaijan. It has a population of 42,196. According to the popular historical manuscripts, the inhabitants of the village are the descendants of an ancient nomadic Turkish tribe which defeated and brought down Cyrus the Great and settled down in Baku during the V-VI centuries.


== History ==
Mashtagha Village (later transformed into a settlement) with an area of up to 6,000 hectares, which is considered to be one of the largest settlements in Baku, has an ancient history. Here are preserved ancient customs and traditions of Azerbaijan, beliefs and beliefs, mythological imaginations, oral literature. More precisely, the population of the village transmits all these generations to one another and lives today as the most beautiful spirits.
The village of Mashtaga also confirms its history with its architectural monuments, which have been erected in the history of stone. Unfortunately, the extensive archaeological excavations in the village are not satisfactory, and historical facts are not satisfactory for science. Since the Middle Ages, 27 baths, 21 houses, defense towers, 20 mosques have been built in the Middle Ages, and its historic territory is rich in large-scale public buildings, leaving it second after Baku. The presence of 5 mosques, 7 baths and 5 pogroms in one neighborhood was an exception in Absheron.
The word "Mashtaga" appeared before this village itself. The prominent Azerbaijani historian, Abbasqulu Agha Bakikhanov, suggested the idea of the Mashtaga toponym "massaget" in the "Gulustan Ilam". Another meaning of this place was also given to Abbasgulu Agha Bakikhanov as "Mashadi Agha" in "Gulistani-Iram". Baku khanate Mirza Muhammad khan once built a magnificent castle here. There was a mosque next to the tower. It was destroyed in the 20s of the last century. Copper coins were discovered during excavations around the village. Researchers say the village has an ancient history. Unfortunately, Mashtaga, which was exposed to the occupation of the invaders, has been repeatedly destroyed.

Soviet-era construction work accelerated settlement in the village, where the fastest growing.
