Mottola (Mottolese: Mòtele, IPA: [ˈmɔːtələ]) is a town and comune in the province of Taranto and region of Apulia in southeast Italy.
It stands on a hill 387 metres (1,270 ft) above mean sea level in the sub-region of Murgia. It is also called "The Ionian Spy" for its strategic geographical position. From various points of the town all of the Gulf of Taranto can be seen.
The economy is based mostly on agriculture and food production (olives, wine, citrus fruits, vegetables). Tourism and the manufacture of wooden fixtures are also being developed.


== History ==
Mottola's hill was inhabited since prehistory, as testified by several findings from that age.
In 1023, a "castellum" was built here by Byzantine catapan Basil Boioannes. During the subsequent Norman domination, the town became a Diocese until 1818, when it lost the title for Castellaneta.
In 1653 the fief was sold to Francesco Caracciolo, Duke of Martina Franca. After the Italian unification, Mottola was a center of Brigandage".

Mottola enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate, with the greatest amounts of precipitation mainly occurring from mid-October to mid-April; any precipitation is sparse during summer and it generally takes the form of showers and/or thunderstorms.
