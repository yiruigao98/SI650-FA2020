== History ==
Benjamin Griffith was awarded the first land grant in what is now called Mauldin in 1784. The name of Mauldin was given to the town almost accidentally in 1820 thanks to South Carolina's lieutenant governor, W. L. Mauldin. The train station was called "Mauldin" because the lieutenant governor had assisted in getting the Greenville Laurens Railroad Company to come through the village. Over time, the entire area took the name of Mauldin.
During the Civil War, many of Mauldin's citizens left to fight, and the city virtually dried up. It never completely recovered until after World War II when the community was incorporated as a town (1960).
