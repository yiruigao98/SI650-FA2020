The Wiyot and Yurok people continue to live here in their traditional territories and both groups are ingrained within the McKinleyville community.
McKinleyville is a community made up of a combination of smaller settlements. Joe Dows settled in the general area in the 1860s and that area was known as Dows Prairie. Slightly south was a small community called Minor (also known as Minorville). Minor was first settled in the late-19th century. Just south of Minor was Calville. Calville was settled by the employees of the California Barrel Company. After President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901 the community of Minor changed its name to McKinleyville in his honor. All three areas are collectively considered to be part of McKinleyville.The first post office at McKinleyville opened in 1903, closed in 1921, and was re-opened in 1955.McKinleyville is a community with mainly retail and professional businesses to serve its residents but is not an incorporated city or town.
