Manosque (French pronunciation: ​[manɔsk]; Provençal Occitan: Manòsca in classical norm or Manosco in Mistralian norm) is the largest town and commune in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department in southeastern France. However, it is not the préfecture (capital) of the department, which resides in the smaller town of Digne-les-Bains. Manosque is located at the far eastern end of the Luberon near the Durance river.


== History ==
Manosque has existed since before 966 when it is first mentioned historically. Commerce thrived in the town in the 13th century leading the population to increase to 10,000 inhabitants. It was at this time that the city walls were constructed. The walls have been completely destroyed apart from a few remaining gates. The population suffered greatly starting in the 18th century due to plagues in 1720 and 1834. Between 1950 and 1970 the town saw a huge increase in population along with other areas south of the Luberon. A threefold increase in inhabitants occurred.
