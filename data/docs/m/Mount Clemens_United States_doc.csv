Mount Clemens is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 16,314 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Macomb County.


== History ==
Mount Clemens was first surveyed in 1795 after the American Revolutionary War by Christian Clemens, who settled there four years later. Clemens and his friend, John Brooks, built a distillery, which attracted workers and customers, helping to settle the area. Brooks and Clemens platted the land, and the town was named after Clemens in 1818. It received a post office in 1821, with John Stockton as the first postmaster. Christian Clemens is buried at Clemens Park, located just north of downtown.The settlement filed for incorporation as a village in 1837, but this was not acted upon by the legislature until 1851. It was later incorporated as a city in 1879.  It became the seat of Macomb County on March 11, 1818.The Mount Clemens Public Library opened in 1865.Historically, Mount Clemens' largest industry for more than 100 years, from 1873 to 1974, was tourism related to the mineral baths, drawn from springs that were scattered throughout the city. Such mineral baths were very popular and were tourist destinations. At the peak of the industry, the city had 11 bathhouses and several hotels related to this trade. The first bathhouse was built in 1873 and was known as "The Original"; it was located on the corner of Jones and Water streets. The bathhouse burned in 1883 but it was rebuilt even larger the following year to accommodate the crowds of customers. Over the years, noted visitors such as film actors Clark Gable and Mae West, athletes Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey, news magnate William Randolph Hearst, and the wealthy Vanderbilt family vacationed in the city to take advantage of the mineral springs baths.
The only remaining bathhouse building from this era is St. Joseph's Sanitarium and Bath House. It has recently been renamed as Select Specialty Hospital and is owned by Select Medical Corporation. This last bath house is in danger of being demolished, but the Friends of Historic Preservation are working with the city to preserve it.The Olympia Salon & Spa, located in the Martha Washington Sanitarium on Cass Ave, is again offering mineral baths.
Throughout the late 20th century, the suburban expansion of Metropolitan Detroit and its exurbs affected the city of Mt. Clemens as well as its surrounding townships.
