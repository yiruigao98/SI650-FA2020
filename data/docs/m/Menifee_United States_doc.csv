Menifee is a city in Riverside County, California, United States, and part of the Los Angeles Combined Statistical Area. The city is centrally located in the heart of Southern California, in the Menifee Valley. It is almost 15 miles (24 km) north of Temecula and just north of Murrieta. Menifee is roughly 46 square miles (100 km2) in size and has an elevation of 1,424 feet (434 m). The incorporated City of Menifee includes the communities of Sun City, Quail Valley, Paloma Valley, and Romoland.


== History ==
The area was originally inhabited by the Luiseño people, specifically the Pechanga band. In the 18th century, the area fell under Spanish rule and was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1850 as a result of the Mexican–American War.
Farming, which began in the mid-19th century, was concentrated in the Menifee area. Mining began in the early 1880s with the discovery of a significant quartz lode by miner Luther Menifee Wilson, from whom Menifee derived its name.
Early development of the Menifee area began with Sun City in the early 1960s, conceptualized as an active retirement community by Del Webb, a building contractor from Phoenix, Arizona. Webb also developed Sun City, Arizona, under the same concept. Sun City is located in the northwestern part of Menifee and features a mix of residential and commercial activity.
The Menifee area later grew during the late 1980s and early 1990s as a master-planned community. However, a lack of resources such as industry-oriented occupations and high-density retail and commercial businesses caused many residents to drive to cities such as Temecula or Murrieta to shop, dine, or work. In recent years, however, there has been substantial growth in Menifee, attracting many new residents from all areas of Southern California such as San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles, as well as other parts of the Inland Empire.
On June 3, 2008, the residents of the communities encompassing the Menifee area voted to incorporate together to form Riverside County's 26th city. The new City of Menifee was officially established on October 1, 2008.

On June 3, 2008, voters elected to incorporate Menifee as a general law city. The new City of Menifee was officially established on October 1, 2008, and is the 26th city located within Riverside County. It was first governed by a five-member city council consisting of Wallace Edgerton as the mayor; Darcy Kuenzi as the mayor pro-tem; and Fred Twyman, John Vaughn Denver, and Scott Mann as councilmembers. In 2010, Fred Twyman was appointed vice mayor (a new terminology). Wallace Edgerton was re-appointed mayor.
In 2010, Scott Mann lost his re-election to Tom Fuhrman. John Denver renewed his place on the council by winning re-election over two challengers. Term limits for councilmembers consisting of two four-year terms were placed on the ballot, and the initiative won. An "At large" voting measure and a "four districts plus a mayor" initiative for how councilmembers would represent the people of Menifee were voted on in 2010. The four district plus a mayor narrowly won approval. 
The third city manager, William A. (Bill) Rawlings, was hired in February 2011. The first city manager was George Wentz, followed by Steve Harding (former Murrieta city manager) as interim for several months. William Rawlins was chosen city manager in 2011. 
As of December 2011, the city council consisted of: John Denver (mayor); Tom Fuhrman (mayor pro tem); and councilmembers Wallace Edgerton, Sue Krisjansson and Darcy Kuenzi.
In the November 2012 election, Scott Mann was named mayor. Greg August was also elected to council. Darcy Kuenzi and Sue Kristjansson lost their council seats. City manager Bill Rawlings resigned. Rob Johnson was appointed interim city manager. Edgerton was named deputy mayor.
As of the election on Tuesday, November 4, 2014, Matt Liesemeyer was elected and John Denver was re-elected as councilmen, and Scott Mann was re-elected as mayor. Tom Fuhrman lost his council seat. In 2015, Greg August was named mayor pro-tem. Scott Mann withdrew his re-election nomination in 2016 due to an FPPC violation of using campaign funding for personal funding. Following Mann, and soon after Rob Johnson resigned, Menifee City Council appointed Ronald Bradley, retired Temecula city manager, as interim city manager. One year later, city council appointed permanent city manager Armando G. Villa, known for team-building and pro-business leadership style.
