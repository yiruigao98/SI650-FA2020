== History ==
Much of the present area of Arusha Region used to be Maasai land. The Maasai are still the dominant community in the region. Their influence is reflected in the present names of towns, regional culture, cuisine, and geographical features.
The administrative region of Arusha existed in 1922 while mainland Tanzania was a British mandate under the League of Nations and known as Tanganyika. In 1948, the area was in the Northern Province, which includes the present day regions of Manyara and Kilimanjaro. In 1966, under the newly independent Tanzanian government, Arusha was given its own regional status.In 2002, Manyara Region was created and was split from Arusha Region. Portions of the former Arusha Region districts of Kiteto, Babati, Mbulu, Hanang, and a tiny piece of Monduli were incorporated into the Manyara Region.
Arusha was the largest region in Tanzania from 1966-2002.
