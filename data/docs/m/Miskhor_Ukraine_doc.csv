The Yusupov Palace (Ukrainian: Юсуповський палац; Russian: Юсуповский дворец) is a palace located in the town of Koreiz, near Yalta in Crimea. It was built for Prince Felix Yusupov-Soumorokov-Elston, father of Prince Felix Yusupov (1887–1967) in 1909 by Nikolay Krasnov, the architect responsible for the imperial Livadia Palace in nearby Yalta. The palace, whose style may be described as Renaissance Revival and Roman Revival, boasts a romantic park with exotic plants and a wine cellar founded by Prince Lev Galitzine in the 19th century.
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the palace was nationalized and served as Joseph Stalin's favorite dacha during the Yalta Conference and at other times.
From 1991 to March 2014 Yusupov Palace was owned by the President of Ukraine. On 21 October 2014, The Council of Ministers of Crimea decided to transfer to use for the president of Russia.
After the Annexation of Crimea to Russia in March 2014, the Yusupov Palace became a special complex for the administration of affairs of the President of the Russian Federation.
