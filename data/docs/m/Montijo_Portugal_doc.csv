== History ==
Montijo was known as Aldeia Galega until July 6, 1930, in spite of the fact that it was a small town and no longer a village. It was elevated to city status on August 14, 1985.
Paleolithic vestiges of human settlement suggest that the region was occupied into the pre-history. Yet, the first historical references date to the 12th century, in 1186, with the donations of religious and hereditary lands to Paio Peres, that initiated formal occupation.Initially, the settlement was a constituted of poor hovels, that were villages for fishermen and farmers, but by the 14th century, the area had developed into a sizeable centre, with its own church, dedicated to São Sebastião.
During the reigns of Afonso IV, Pedro and Fernando, Montijo was awarded various privileges that John I later confirmed in 1385. For a long time, the place formed one ecclesiastical parish with neighboring Alcochete, whose seat was in the village of Santa Maria de Sabonha, in the parish of São Francisco. On 15 September 1514, Manual I conceded a foral (charter), which was quickly renewed on 17 January 1515, with Alcochete.In 1539, the centres separated resulting in administrative autonomy. The grand postmaster, Luís Afonso, established his seat in the south in 1533, due to its geographic conditions and close proximity to Spain and southern Portugal. A year earlier, John III had registered the title to the village of Aldea Galega.Over the years, many monarch passed through Montijo, such as the future John IV of Portugal, who arrived on 5 December 1640, to enthusiastic cheers from the nobles, clerics and people of the village.In 1808 Montijo suffered the roaming attacks and pillage of French forces.Twenty one years later, a carriage post between Montijo and Badajoz/Madrid, which was of short duration and lasted until 1831. In 1843, during an official visit, Queen Maria II of Portugal necessitated the carriage, allowing a 26-hour trip from Montijo to Badajoz. But, the service was suspended in 1864.Aldeia Galega was one of the first centres to celebrate the implantation of the 5 October 1910 revolution, before Lisbon and other major centres.
