The area around Mino was part of traditional Mino Province. During the Edo period, Kanamori Nagachika, the founder of Takayama Domain was granted permission by Tokugawa Ieyasu to build Oguriyama Castle on the Nagara River. Due to floods, the castle town was relocated in 1605 to higher ground. The area later became part of the holdings of Owari Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. In the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, Mugi District in Gifu Prefecture was created, and with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on July 1, 1889 the town of Kozuchi was created. In July 1909 Kozuchi was the site of a meteorite impact. The meteorite, which massed about 13.5 kg (30 lb), broke into pieces and fell across an area 13 miles (21 km) long and 5 miles (8.0 km) wide. The largest piece, about 4 kg (8.8 lb), fell in the village of Gokurakuji.
On April 1, 1911, Kozuchi was renamed Mino . Mino was raised to city status on April 1, 1954 with the merger of the town of Mino with the villages of Suhara, Shimomaki, Kamimaki, Oyada, Aimi, and Nakauchi.
