Makum once had a thriving community of Chinese who had settled in the area in the 1830s. The Chinatown in Makam was closed in 1962 following the outbreak of the Sino-Indian War – as Assam is in close proximity to India-China border, there were heightened security concerns. The Chinatown (now known as Chinapatty) is now inhabited by local population but many of the Chinese house structures left behind by the original Chinese inhabitants still remain. The Assamese novel "Makam" (মাকাম) written by award-winning writer Rita Chowdhury narrates the ordeals faced by the Chinese community of Makum following the outbreak of the war, such as their relocation to detention camps in Rajasthan and the deportation of some to China. The main character of the novel is a resident of Chinapatty.The annual Durga Puja celebrations organised by the Shree Shree Durga Puja Committee in Chinapatty since 1982 is considered a hallmark example of religious harmony because people from all religions participate in the organisation and celebration of the festival without any differentiation based on religious affiliation.
