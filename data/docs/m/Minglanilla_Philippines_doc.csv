== History ==
Father Sanchez, Minglanilla's first parish priest, is credited as the founder of the town in 1858. The roads and bridges were built by the same Fr. Sanchez together with Fr. Magaz.
There were a number of capitanes who headed the town during the Spanish era. The first capitan was Hilario Castañares. During the American regime the first was Canuto Larrobis. The first elected municipal mayor was Gregorio de la Calzada.
Buat was the former name of Minglanilla. It was the place where early settlers dried (buad/buat) their sea catches. But in 1858, it was renamed by Fr. Sanchez after a municipality called Minglanilla in Castilla–La Mancha, Spain.
The town suffered setbacks, among them during the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1898 when insurrectos burned down its municipal building and looted many houses. This event is remembered by a street named 18 de Julio (18 July). In 1942, its poblacion was razed to the ground by the Japanese in retaliation for the presence of the guerrillas in the town.

Minglanilla is a part of the Cebu metropolitan area.
Minglanilla is primarily a residential town, with most of its population commuting to Cebu City for work. Owing to its close location to Cebu City, which is only 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) away from the municipality, it hosts many subdivisions.
Prior to its suburbanization, Minglanilla's primary industry was agriculture. However, since the 2000s, when the municipality saw developments trickle down from Cebu City due to the city's own economic boom, the municipality has shifted into having a more service-driven economy.

It is the first amusement park in Cebu, and is located in the larger Belmont One development, which hosts a supermarket, a hardware, restaurants, among other retail components, also located within Barangay Calajo-an.The municipality will be the site of the Ming-Mori Reclamation and Industrial Park, a development which is envisioned primarily to host light industries, but also to other mixed-use developments as well.

Annually held every Easter Sunday, the occasion primarily focuses the re‑enactment of the meeting of the Risen Christ and the Sorrowful Mother – followed by a string of activities and events scheduled to take place throughout the day. As one of the biggest annually celebrated occasions of the municipality, the festival takes a direct translation in celebrating Christ's resurrection, with street dancing, a wide assortment of day games, and entertainment features. Essentially a socio-religious event, celebrations have played the role of host to a diverse range of organized contests, competitions and games, including a carabao race, a burda-making contest (burda = embroidery), and a mud volleyball tournament. Easter-egg hunts also are part of Sugat-Kabanhawan festivals, just as the street dancing and the ritual showdown have become mainstay staples of the festivals overall program flow.Annual Fiesta of the Immaculate Heart of Mary
