== Etymology ==
The name Manado is derived from the  Sangir language word manaro, meaning 'on the far coast' or 'in the distance', and originally referred to the further of two islands which can be seen from the mainland.  When the settlement on this island was relocated to the mainland, the name Manado was brought with it, after which the island itself became referred to as Manado Tua (Old Manado).  The name for Manado in the Sangir language is Manaro.


== History ==
The first mention of Manado comes from a world map by French cartographer Nicolas Desliens, which shows the island of Manarow (today's Manado Tua).  Before Europeans arrived in North Sulawesi, the area was under the rule of the Sultan of Ternate, who exacted tribute, and introduced the Muslim religion among some of its inhabitants.  The Portuguese made the Sultan their vassal, taking possession of the Minahasa, and establishing a factory in Wenang.
Meanwhile, the Spanish had already set themselves up in the Philippines and Minahasa was used to plant coffee that came from South America because of its rich soil.  Manado was further developed by Spain as a centre of commerce for the Chinese traders who traded the coffee in China.  With the help of native allies, the Spanish took over the Portuguese fortress in Amurang in the 1550s, and Spanish settlers also established a fort at Manado so that eventually Spain controlled all of the Minahasa.  It was in Manado where one of the first Indo-Eurasian (Mestizo) communities in the archipelago developed during the 16th century.  The first King of Manado (1630) named Muntu Untu was in fact the son of a Spanish Mestizo.

Spain renounced her possessions in Minahasa by means of a treaty with the Portuguese in return for a payment of 350,000 ducats.  Minahasan natives made an alliance treaty with the Dutch, and expelled the last of the Portuguese from Manado a few years later.
The Dutch East India Company or Verenigde Oost Indische Compagnie (VOC) built a fortress in Manado named Fort Amsterdam in 1658.  As with regions in eastern Indonesia, Manado has undergone Christianisation by Dutch missionaries, including Riedel and John Gottlieb Schwarz.  The Dutch missionaries built the first Christian church in Manado called Oude Kerk (Old church), which still stands, and is now called Gereja Sentrum.  HMS Dover captured Manado in June 1810.  The Javanese prince Diponegoro was exiled to Manado by the Dutch government in 1830 for leading a war of rebellion against the Dutch.  In 1859, the English biologist Alfred Wallace visited Manado and praised the town for its beauty.
In 1919, the Apostolic Prefecture of Celebes was established in the city.  In 1961, it was promoted as the Diocese of Manado.
The Japanese captured Manado in the Battle of Manado in January 1942.  The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II.
In 1958, the headquarters of the rebel movement Permesta was moved to Manado.  When Permesta confronted the central government with demands for political, economic and regional reform, Jakarta responded by bombing the city in February 1958, and then invading in June 1958.

=== Ethnicity and languages ===

Currently, the majority of Manado city residents are from the Minahasa ethnic group, because Manado is located in Minahasan lands.  The indigenous people of Manado are from the Tombulu people seen from several urban villages in Manado from the Tombulu language, for example: Wenang (Wenang / Mahawenang - kolintang), Tumumpa (down), Mahakeret (yelling), Tikala Ares (Walak Ares Tombulu, where the word 'ares' means punishable), Ranotana (ground water), Winangun (built), Wawonasa (wawoinasa - above sharpened), Pinaesaan (unity place), Pakowa (Tree of Treasure), Teling (fur / bamboo to make equipment), Titiwungen (excavated), Tuminting (from the word Ting-Ting: the bell, the word insert -um- means showing the verb, so Tuminting: ringing bell), Pondol (Edge), Wanea (from word Wanua: meaning the country), etc.  While the Malalayang area has residents mainly from the Bantik people, other indigenous groups in Manado today are from the Sangir, Gorontalo, Mongondow, Babontehu, Talaud, Tionudese, Siau, and Borgo peoples.  Most of the Minahasan people are Dutch or other European descent.  Due to the large number of Arabian peranakan communities, the existence of the Kampung Arab which is within a radius near Pasar '45 still survives until now, and has become one of the religious tourism destinations.  Other ethnicities represented include Javanese, Chinese, Batak, Makassar, and Moluccans.  A small Jewish community also exists.
