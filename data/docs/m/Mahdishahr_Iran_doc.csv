The distance between Sangsar city and Semnan city is 20 kilometers.  The altitude is about 1630 meters above sea level.

The primary religious belief in the area now is Shi‘ite Islam, but before the Islamic Revolution, there were many followers of the Baháʼí Faith in Sangsar, who had to migrate from the city after the revolution, due to a wide range of persecutions. As for other towns of Iran, the name has thus been changed by the Islamic authorities into Mahdishahr as if to signal its imposed pure Muslim identity. Mahdi is the Shia Muslim hidden Imam and Shahr means town in Persian, so Mahdishahr literally means town of Mahdi.
