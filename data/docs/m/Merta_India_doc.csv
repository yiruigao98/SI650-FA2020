== History ==

Merta was once a prosperous kingdom of the brave Mertia Rathore Rajputs, the descendants of Rao Duda, Ruler of Merta (1495-1525 AD), fourth son of Rao Jodha, and grandfather of fabled saint Princess Mira Bai, daughter in law of Rana Sanga of Mewar.Later, out of jealousy, during the reign of Rao Veeramdev, Merta was attacked by Rao Maldeo Rathore of Jodhpur, the head of the Rathore clan. Thereafter, Viramdev established rule at Degana, Parbatsar and Ajmer respectively, but was dethroned again. Being highly demoralized, he took refuge at Amarsar, the Shekhawat capital and after a year persuaded Sur Emperor Sher Shah Suri to attack Jodhpur. When Sher Shah attacked Jodhpur in the Battle of Sammel. It is in this context, the Emperor said – Mutthi bhar bajre ke liye main dilli ki gaddi kho baithta, meaning 'I would have lost the throne of Delhi for a fistful of Pearl Millet (the Barren Land of Marwar).
One of the significant consequence of the war was regain of Merta throne by Rao Viramdev Mertia, whose son, Rao Jaimal succeeded him and in tune with the traditions of the brave clan added four moons to the glory of Merta. Rao Jaimal (1544–1568 AD) was also the commander of Mewar where his cousin sister Mira Bai was married into the Sisodia Royal Family. As against submissive Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner and various other Rajput Kingdoms, only Merta and Mewar refused to give daughters to Mughals. When Akbar attacked Mewar, with an army around 100,000 men, Rao Jaimal, the commander of Mewar, fought fiercely but was killed in battle. Merta was soon merged with Jodhpur State and 14 his sons were given small principalities nearby.
The same spirit was shown by many descendants of the Mertia Royal Family, including the Chiefs of Rian, Methri and Alniyawas who fought against the rebels of Kumpawat clan in the battle of Merta in 1790 AD and suffered mass annihilation. One of the scion of the family who rose to prominence during the reign of Padshah Aurangzeb was Maharaja Raghunath Singh Mertia (1660–1683 AD), who conquered Maroth or Gaurawati and is ancestor of the rulers of Panch Mahal Maroth.
