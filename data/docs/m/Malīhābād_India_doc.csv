== History ==
"According to tradition, the town was founded by Malia  a Pasi; but nothing is known of its history till the reign of Akbar, when it was inhabited by Pathans. The place is said to have been founded by one malia, a pasi, but nothing is known of this person, although is appears that the Pasis and Arakhs held sway over this and the surrounding villages form the earliest time. It is also said that the Pasis has mint here and the their coins have sometimes been found, from which the town gained its name of Khonta Shahr or the city of the bad money. Nothing definite, however, is known of the place till the time of Akbar, when it was colonized by the Pathans. The date of the Muslman occupation in uncertain, but it has been suggested that is occurred as oarly as the time of Muhammad Bakhtiya Khilji, who invaded Oudh in 1202. Prior to the time of Shuja-ud-daula it seems that the principal sites were bakhtiyarnagar and Garhi Sanjar Khan. During his reign the Pathan proprietors granted as portion of malihabad, known as the Kenwal-har, to Faqir Muhammad Khan, as Afridi Pathan of Rohilkhand. The bazar Mirzaganj was built by Mirza Hasan Beg But before this the old bazar is found in Village Garhi sanjar khan, as official of the Oudh Government. The other bazar of Amaniganj beyond the railway station owes its origin to Asaf-ud-daula, who built the place on his way to fight with the Rohillas."It is said to have been the chief seat of the Arakhs or Pasis, and to have been founded by Malia  Pasi, whose brother Salia founded Sandila in Hardoi. Even under the- rule of this tribe it must have been a place of considerable importance. The Pasi had power and independence enough to have a mint here, and to this day coin of his time is said to be occasionally dug up, giving it thereby the name in native traditions of the Khonta Shahar, " the city of the bad money."Malihabad prides itself on Nawab Faqueer Mohammad Khan 'Goya', the poet and courtier of Awadh; "Shaayar-e-Inquilaab"Padma Bhushan Josh Malihabadi(born as Shabbir Hasan Khan), who later migrated to Pakistan after this.
