== History ==
For a long time Makiivka was thought to have been established in 1777, but recent research shows that it has been mentioned in historical records since approx. 1696.  The first mine was opened in 1875. In 1899 metallurgical settlement was founded nearby called Dmytrievsk, named after Dmitry Ilovaisky, son of count Ilovaysky - the landlord of the region.
Makiivka was only a small village when it was combined with nearby Dmytriivsk. Dmytriivsk subsequently developed as one of the largest coal-mining and industrial centres of the Donets Basin coalfield. In 1931, Dmytriivsk-Makiyivka was renamed Makiivka.
During the War in Donbass the city town hall was taken over by pro-Russian separatists on 13 April 2014. Since then Makiivka is controlled by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic
