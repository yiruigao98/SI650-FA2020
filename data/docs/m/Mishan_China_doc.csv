== History ==


=== Early medieval history ===
From 698 to 936, the kingdom of Balhae occupied northern Korea and parts of Manchuria and Primorsky Krai, consisting of the Nanai, the Udege, and descendants of the Tungus-speaking people and the people of the recently fallen Goguryeo kingdom of Korea. The vicinity of Tongjiang  was settled at this moment by Funie Mohe tribes (Hanja/Hanzi: 拂涅靺鞨; pinyin: Fúniè Mòhé; Korean: 불열말갈). These tribes were submitted to Balhae Kingdom under King Mun's reign (737-793).
Later, King Seon (r.818-830),  administrated their territories by creating a prefecture in the neighbourhood : The Dongpyong Prefecture (Korean: 동평부; Hanja: 東平府) with Yiju (Korean: 이주; Hanja: 伊州), present-day Dangbi (Chinese: 当壁; pinyin: Dāngbì) as its administrative centre.
