Mianwali District was an agricultural region with forests during the Indus Valley Civilization.  Then later Vedic Civilization took place. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul, followed by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The population of the Punjab region became majority Muslim, following the conquests by various Muslim dynasties from Central Asia. Before the British rule, the area formed an integral portion of the Graeco-Bactrian Empire of Kabul and the Punjab. Immediately preceding the annexation of the Punjab by the British after the Anglo-Sikh Wars, this area was part of the Sikh Empire. During British rule, the Indian empire was subdivided into provinces, divisions and districts; afterward, the independence of Pakistan divisions remained the third tier of government until 2000. The British had made the town of Mianwali as tehsil headquarters of Bannu District then part of Dera Ismail Khan Division of Punjab province. The population of Mianwali, according to the 1901 census of India, was 3,591.
