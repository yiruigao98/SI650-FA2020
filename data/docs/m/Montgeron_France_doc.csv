== Geography ==


=== Climate ===
Situated in the region of Île-de-France, Montgeron has an oceanic climate, with cool winters and mild summers, and has more precipitation than others in the central parts. The mean temperature is around 10.8 °C, with a maximum of 15.2 °C and a minimum of 6.4 °C. However, the actual temperatures recorded are 24.5 °C in July at the maximum and 0.7 °C in January at the minimum, but the records registered the maximum temperature of 38.2 °C on 1 July 1952 and the minimum temperature of -19.6°C on 17 January 1985. Due to the lower urban density between Paris and its suburbs, a difference of one to two degrees Celsius is felt strongly. The amount of sunshine is comparable to the average of the regions of the north of the Loire with 1,798 hours per year. Precipitation is also distributed over the year, with a total of 598.3 millimeters of rain and an approximate average of fifty millimeters per month.


=== Transport ===

Although Montgeron is away from the course of the Seine, major axes of communication cross at Montgeron, most of them inherited from before. It was crossed by the old National Road 6 (N6) but now the road takes a detour to the west of the city center; the route is now occupied by the Departemental Road 50 (D50). The road D50 intersects the east-west running Departemental Road 31 (D31), which the latter leads to the neighboring commune of Yerres. The new portion of N6 shares its northern part with the Departemental Road 448 (D448) which the latter follows the river Seine south to Corbeil-Essonnes.
Recent development and heavy traffic have made access to the city center much more difficult, which accentuates commercial desertification.
Since 1849, the Paris-Marseille railway passes through the northeast of Montgeron, now served by the Montgeron-Crosne station on the Paris RER line D.  The rail link is complemented by several bus lines, including the Noctilien Line N134 ensuring services during the night(click this reference for the French Wikipedia:), line 91.09 of the Albatrans bus network, line 191-100 of the Mobilien network, lines A, E, P, Q and V of the STRAV bus network, and lines IV and 501 of the Seine Sénart Bus network have stops in Montgeron.
The town is located eight kilometers south-east of Paris-Orly airport and thirty-four kilometers south of Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle airport. Leisure and business aviation will be oriented towards the Melun-Villaroche air base, ultimately transformed into a tourism and business airport, located nineteen kilometers to the southeast.

== Populations and Society ==


=== Demographics ===
The evolution of the population is known through the censuses of the population carried out in the commune since 1793. Starting from 2006, the legal populations of the communes are published annually by INSEE. The census is now based on an annual collection of information, successively concerning all municipal territories over a period of five years. For municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants, censuses are taken each year following a sample survey of a sample of addresses representing 8% of their dwellings, unlike other municipalities which have an actual census every five years.
In 2017, the town had 23,775 inhabitants, an increase of 2.12% compared to 2012 (Essonne: + 4.74%, France excluding Mayotte: + 2.36%).

   Placed on the important road from Paris to Melun at the edge of the Sénart Forest, Montgeron was a town already counting more than eight hundred and fifty people at the time of the first census of people in 1793. A period of chaotic evolution ensued with a growth to nearly nine hundred inhabitants in 1800 and a decrease until 1851. The milestone of nine hundred residents was reached in 1831 and that of the thousand residents ten years later.
From 1856, following the arrival of the railway, a period of constant progress began, only briefly interrupted by the losses due to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the milestone of two thousand inhabitants being crossed in 1896. At During the twentieth century, the two world conflicts did not prevent the local population explosion, driven by massive urbanization which allowed the town to have nearly four thousand five hundred inhabitants in 1921 and more than ten thousand in 1946. This the figure doubled in the following twelve years and reached the historic peak of twenty-three thousand seven hundred eighty-six in 1975.
The urban rehabilitation operations and the decline in enthusiasm for this town made it lose two thousand people in fifteen years before it returned to demographic growth from 1999, again negative in view of the 2007 figures establishing the Montgeron population to twenty-two thousand nine hundred twenty-nine people.
Immigration has little impact on this demographic development since only 7.6% of the municipal population was foreign in 1999. In that year, the largest communities were distributed between 3.2% of the total for Portuguese population, 0.9% for Algerians, 0.5% for Moroccans, 0.4% for Turks and Italians, 0.3% for Tunisians and 0.2% for Spaniards. Inhabitants of Montgeron are known as Montgeronnais.
