Krasny Yar Krasnoyarsk is a Russian rugby union club founded in 1969 in the city of Krasnoyarsk, the unofficial capital of Russian rugby. They compete in the Professional Rugby League, the premier league in the country. They have an operating budget of 2.5m Euros, making them one of the biggest clubs in the competition.  Their main rival is fellow Krasnoyarsk based, Enisey-STM.
Krasny-Yar play in white and green, and recently moved into their own purpose built stadium.  The stadium holds 3,600 spectators and is the first rugby-specific stadium east of the Urals.  The stadium sold out for a game against VVA-Monino (2 August 2010), emphasising the growing popularity of the sport in Russia.


== History ==
Krasny Yar was founded in 1969 in the city of Krasnoyarsk. It takes its name from the fort of Krasny Yar ("Red Steep Riverbank"), built in 1608; the city around the fort became Krasnoyarsk in 1822. A traditional powerhouse of the game in Russia, Krasny Yar is currently tied with VVA Monino as the most successful team in the country with eight championships in the Super League-Professional Rugby League era.  The club has also won two Soviet Championships.
Although Krasny Yar remain a powerhouse, they have been unsuccessful in the Professional Rugby League era.  The club has not been champions since the Super League era, with their most recent championship being in 2001.  The club's financial resources have also been overtaken by their local rivals, Enisey-STM.
However, in an attempt to once again climb back to the top, Krasny Yar have recently (2010) entered into an agreement with the Canterbury Rugby Union and the Canterbury Crusaders to use their facilities for a three-week period during March and April every year.  The club will use this base to play warm-up games against local New Zealand sides, receive high quality training and recruit players from New Zealand's endless production line.
The arrangement has already born fruit, with several New Zealand players signing on to play for Krasny Yar for the 2010 and 2011 Seasons, while the club has also recruited a New Zealand trainer working with the Canterbury Rugby Union.
