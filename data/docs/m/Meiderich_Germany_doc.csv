Meiderich is a quarter of the city of Duisburg. It is divided into Unter-, Mittel- and Obermeiderich.
Meiderich belongs to the city district Meiderich/Beeck, which started in 1975, during the course of municipal reorganization. On 31 December 2004, 75,000 people lived in the district. Meiderich/Beeck has seven quarters: Beeck, Beeckerwerth, Bruckhausen, Laar, Mittel-, Ober- and Untermeiderich.
Meiderich was first mentioned in the beginning of the 10th century as "Medriki", that means "moist area", in a document of the Werden Abbey. The first church was built in the 13th century. In the Middle Ages there was the village Meiderich surrounded by seven areas of accumulated farms: Berchum, Berg, Borkhofen, Dümpten, Lakum, Lösort and Vohwinkel. The association-football club MSV Duisburg, currently taking part in the third division ("Dritte Liga") in Germany is based in Meiderich; the club's name MSV is derived from "Meidericher Spielverein".
