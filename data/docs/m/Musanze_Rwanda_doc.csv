== Irish Patatoes plantation ==

Irish potatoes are mainly grown in Burera, Musanze, Nyabihu and Rubavu districts and this program is expected to harmonize the Irish potato trading locally and turn it into export-oriented businessIt is the most important crops in Rwanda and is one of the government’s six priority crops falling under the Crop Intensification Program (CIP). Rwanda is the 6th largest producer of potatoes in the region, which is significant given the relative land size of the country. Rwanda increased its Irish potato production from 2,240,000 tons per year in 2013 to 6,000,000 tons per year in 2019. The country accomplished this by expanding the production area from 130,000 ha in 2010 to 200,000 ha, and by yield increases.


=== The key pillars of the government’s Irish potato strategy ===
Strengthening the national potato research program;
Large scale multiplication of quality potato seeds;
Organization of the seed market, advisory services to seed producers and potato farmers;
Development of post-harvest and value-adding activities for the Irish potato.However, four districts (Listed above) in the north-west are responsible for over 60% of the production. There are two growing seasons: from the end of August to early February and from the end of February to early July. Although the Irish potato is a profitable crop, farmers do not invest in high quality seeds, either due to the lack of working capital or due to the lack of access to quality seeds.
The use of improved varieties increases profitability, but only if combined with improved agronomic practices (proper rotation, use of fertilizers and pesticides). The production of certified quality Irish potato seeds is very limited (2% of total planted seeds). The private sector is hardly involved due to the low effective demand from farmers, low availability of pre-basic and basic seeds for multiplication and restrictions on import of pre-basic and basic seeds for the private sector. Currently the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB) is involved in production as well as in the quality control of seed potatoes. Most stakeholders agree that the new seed law should separate these two roles and aim for an active participation of the private sector in certified seed production.
