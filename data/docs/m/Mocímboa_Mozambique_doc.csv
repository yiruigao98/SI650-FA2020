The city was prominent during the colonial period due to its port, which served the export market, and because of its easy access to Tanzania and the north. The Portuguese army had a base there during the independence struggle. During the Mozambican Civil War it was a safe area for internally displaced people. Many people resettled here after the 1992 peace accords.In 2017, an Islamic extremist group linked to ISIL named "Ansar al-Sunna" attacked the city during the Insurgency in Cabo Delgado, killing 17 people. Another attack took place on March 24, 2020, which briefly gave the militants control of the city before they were driven out by the Mozambique Defence Armed Forces. Islamist insurgents took control of the city on August 12, 2020, after defending government forces ran short of ammunition and evacuated, some by sea. Efforts to retake the city from militants were launched immediately.
