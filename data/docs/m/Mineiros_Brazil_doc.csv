== Origin of the name ==
The name "Mineiros" comes from the first explorers who were from Minas Gerais. They settled in the region around 1873, building huts, ranch houses, churches, and chapels for saints.
One of these settlers, who became known as "João Mineiro, because of his origin in Minas Gerais, was supposedly the first European to settle on the banks of a stream, a tributary of the Verdinho River, which soon was called the stream of the "Mineiro". This stream is the Mineiros stream today.
