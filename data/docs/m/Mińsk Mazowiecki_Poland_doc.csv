Mińsk Mazowiecki [ˈmʲiɲsk mazɔˈvʲɛt͡skʲi] (listen) "Masovian Minsk" is a town in central Poland with 40,211 inhabitants (2015). It is situated in the Masovian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Siedlce Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Mińsk County.


== Name ==
The source of town name - Mińsk - is the Mienia River, which in turn derives from the verb 'mienić', which means 'to shine'. The postnominal adjective 'Mazowiecki' shows the historical connection to Mazovia and distinguishes Mińsk Mazowiecki from the Belarusian capital of Minsk.

=== Jewish history ===

In 1768 the restrictions on permanent residence for Jewish people in Mińsk had been lifted. From the 19th century to the 1930s it became very popular. Before the Second World War, there were thousands of Jews living in Mińsk and they had a general synagogue and smaller temples.
Soon after the war began, the Germans created the Mińsk Ghetto. It was liquidated on 21 July 1942. Most of the Jews were killed in Treblinka extermination camp sent in Holocaust trains by the thousands. The remaining Jewish population were killed in Mińsk on 10 January 1943 (500 people) and 5 June (the last 150 people).
