Markkleeberg is a town in the Leipzig district, in the Free State of Saxony, Germany. It is on the river Pleiße, approximately 7 km south of Leipzig.


== History ==
The town now called Markkleeberg has its origins in several towns that have been merged over the years. The center of modern-day Markkleeberg used to be called Oetzsch. It was merged with the smaller outlying district Markkleeberg in 1911 and renamed Oetzsch-Markkleeberg. Oetzsch-Markkleeberg was in turn merged with Gautzsch and the whole town was called "Markkleeberg", although Markkleeberg was the smallest, because it sounded most Germanic at a time of Nazi-led Germanisation.
The etymology of Markkleeberg may be 'clover hill market town '.
The name of Oetzsch has most likely a Wendish origin. In 1316 it was mentioned in a document as "Euschiz". The village originally had the form of a Rundling.
In 1813 much of the Battle of Leipzig took place where today's Markkleeberg is situated.
During 1944–1945, a forced labor camp for women was established in the town, initially a subcamp of the Ravensbrück concentration camp and later of Buchenwald. Among the inmates were a thousand Jewish women from Hungary and 250 French resistance fighters. In early April 1945 the surviving inmates were transferred to the Mauthausen-Gusen camp in Austria.
Today, Markkleeberg is a growing town, thanks to its proximity to Leipzig.
