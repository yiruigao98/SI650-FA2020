It is famous for its katsuobushi processing plants, which produce the chief flavoring ingredient—dried fish flakes—found in Japanese miso soup. About 70 small family businesses year-round boil, cut, dry and smoke the pungent fish, often sending a unique odor of steam, smoke and fish scent across the downtown area and out to sea.
Makurazaki is the site of the terminus of the southernmost JR train line in Japan. Japanese know the town as the Typhoon Ginza (after Ginza in Tokyo). Each summer many cyclones strike the main islands first in the area of Makurazaki.
