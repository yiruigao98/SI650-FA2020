== Etymology ==
Meycauayan got its name came from the words "may kawayan", translated to English as "with bamboo". It is formerly called as Mecabayan.


== History ==
During the Spanish colonization of the country, the town of Meycauayan was established as a settlement by a group of Spanish priests belonging to the Franciscan Order. In 1578, its early inhabitants came into contact with Christianity. In that same year, Father Juan de Placencia and Diego Oropesa built the first church structure, which was believed to be made of nipa and bamboo. Common to all Spanish settlements in that period was the adoption of a patron saint for the newly opened town. Meycauayan has St. Francis of Assisi as the Patron Saint. It was only in 1668, however, that a concrete church structure was erected.
Meycauayan was then one of the largest towns in the province of Bulacan. The towns, which fell under its political jurisdiction, were San Jose del Monte, Bocaue, Valenzuela (formerly Polo), Obando, Marilao, Santa Maria and Pandi. It was also regarded as the unofficial capital of the province, being the hub of activities brought about by the establishment of the market center and the presence of the Spanish military detachment. During the revolution, which was set off by the execution of Dr. Jose Rizal in 1896, Meycauayan contributed its share in the fight against the Spanish conquistadores. Among her sons who figured prominently in the revolution were: Andres Pacheco, Ciriaco Contreras, Guillermo Contreras, Guillermo Bonque, and Liberato Exaltacion. There were many others who had joined the revolution and had displayed their exceptional heroism until 1898, when the country gained its independence from Spain.
In 1949, a big fire razed the market center and several business establishments in the town, causing setbacks to the development of the municipality. It took several years to recover from the destruction and property losses. However, in the 1960s and early part of 1970s, new hope for the development was ushered in. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities were made possible through the assistance of the provincial and national governments. A more sound economic base was established and crop production more than doubled.


=== Cityhood and present ===
On March 5, 2001, Former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9021 converting the municipality of Meycauayan into a component city. The plebiscite was held on March 30, 2001, along with the then-municipality of Cauayan in Isabela. However, the cityhood bid was rejected by voters and Meycauayan remains a municipality. Only the "Yes" votes won in the separate plebiscite for cityhood in Cauayan.
Five years later, on October 2, 2006, Arroyo signed Republic Act 9356, filed by Congresswoman Reylina Nicolas on July 24 of this year as House Bill 4397, converting Meycauayan into a city once again for the second time. Its second cityhood bid was endorsed by Mayor of this then-municipality, Eduardo Alarilla, who also endorsed the first cityhood bid in 2001. Meycauayan was successfully became a city (third city in Bulacan) on December 10, 2006, after their voters ratified the law in the plebiscite. Alarilla who have seven months left on his third and final term, became the city's first mayor. His wife, Joan succeeded him in the 2007 elections. The incumbent mayor is Linabelle Ruth R. Villarica, wife of her predecessor and current congressman, Henry R. Villarica.

Florentino Blanco, town mayor from 1987 to 1992, ran in 1995 but was disqualified by the Supreme Court for vote buying on July 21, 1997. Blanco was replaced by Vice Mayor Eduardo Nolasco in an acting capacity, serving out the remainder of his term.
Blanco ran again in 1998 but lost to Eduardo Alarilla; Blanco attempted to file an election protest against Alarilla but the COMELEC dismissed the case. He attempted to run again in 2004 but later withdrew his candidacy. In 2007, he ran once more but lost to Eduardo Alarilla's wife, Joan Alarilla (Mr. Alarilla has then reached the three-term limit imposed by law). The then Mayor Alarilla then attempted to disqualify Blanco; the COMELEC ruled in favor of Alarilla, but the Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that Blanco is still eligible to run for public office.
