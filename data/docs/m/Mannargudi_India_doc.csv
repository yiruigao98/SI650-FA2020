== Etymology ==

The word Mannargudi is derived from the Tamil word Mannar referring to Vishnu and gudi referring to a place, meaning the "Place of Vishnu". The town was also called "Mannarkovil" or "Rajamannarkoil" after the Rajagopalaswamy temple. The town is locally referred as "Mannai". Hindus refer the place as "Dakshina Dwarka", meaning Southern Dwarka. The town was known during the period of Nayaks for the 25 ft (7.6 m) tall compound wall around the Rajagopalaswamy temple, leading to the adage Mannargudi Mathil Azhagu, (meaning "the walls of Mannargudi are beautiful"). The town is also called "Koil mattrum Madil Nagaram" referring to the compound wall around the temple.


== History ==

Mannargudi was founded as an agraharam village as Rajadhiraja Chaturvedimangalam by the Medieval Chola king Rajadhiraja Chola (1018–1054 CE), who constructed the Jayam Kondanathar temple and the Rajathirajeswara temple. The Rajagopalaswami temple is believed to have been constructed by Kulothunga Chola I (1070–1125 CE), with bricks and mortar, indicated by various stone inscriptions found at the site. The town started to grow around the temple. Successive kings of the Chola empire, Rajaraja Chola III (1216–56 CE) and Rajendra Chola III (1246–79 CE), and Thanjavur Nayak king Achyuta Deva Raya (1529–1542 CE) expanded the temple.  The temple contains inscriptions of the Hoysala kings and information about grants by Vijayanagara kings, and many records of the later Nayaks and Marathas. A fort was constructed under the rule of the Hoysala kings, and Hindu temples were built under the leadership of both Hoysala and Pandya rulers.Mannargudi was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1311 CE. Following brief occupations by the Madurai Sultanate and the Hoysalas, it became a part of the Vijayanagar Empire. After the decline of Vijayanagar Empire, Mannargudi was ruled by the Thanjavur Nayaks. The Thanjavur Nayaks made the temple as their dynastic and primary shrine and made significant additions. The current temple structure, hall of thousand pillars, main gopuram (temple gateway tower) and the big compound wall around the temple were built by the king Vijaya Raghava Nayak (1532–1575 CE). Raghunathabhyudayam, a doctrine by Nayaks explains the donation of an armour studded with precious stones to the main deity of the temple by the king. It is believed Vijaya Raghava Nayak erected the large tower in front of the temple so that he could view the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple. He was also called "Mannarudasan" as he carried out extensive renovations of the Rajagopalaswami temple complex and is credited by some to have reclaimed the land from the surrounding forest.The Thanjavur Marathas gained control during the later part of 18th century until its annexation by the British East India Company in 1799. It was constituted as a municipality during 1866 and was a part of the erstwhile Tanjore district. The town was the headquarters and the only town in Mannargudi taluk. The town emerged as one of the chief centres of inland trade in the district during the British rule. Rice, betel leaves, groundnut, oil, metal articles and clothes were the major exports. A Methodist mission was established in the town during the third decade of the 19th century. During 1944, Chinese copper coins were unearthed from Thaliketti village in the region, dated to Sui period (585 CE) to the end of Song period (1275 CE). The coins indicate a possible Buddhist influence in the region. Mannargudi continued to be part of Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district.
