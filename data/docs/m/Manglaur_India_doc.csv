Manglaur is an old place of North Hind which has its own recognition. At one side where it is a matter of pride being a historical place. On the other hand, it bears such good people who are owner of unlimited assets. History is witness that its name is on the basis of its bearer whose name was Mangal Sen. For a long time it was the capital of Mangal Sen. whose symbol is present even today. There is also an evidence from Aaine Akbar (author Abul Fajal), too, that it was a historical place.
Manglaur is a historical town where a fort made of brick is present which was built at the time of king Vikramaditya and it was under the control of Brahmenes and Badgujers.
At the time of King Vikaramadiyta (375–414 A.D) Mangal had built this fort. One portion of Wall of that fort is safe in corner of the shirine of Shah Vilayat. The width of this wall is 12 ft. And inside this surrounding there is a Masjid present built by Gyasuddeen Balban whose kutba is fitted in the wall of Masjid. From Mangal Sen to British Rule Manglaur was a tehsil.
Most of the time Manglaur was independent and it saw many rises and falls. But after a while it was a state of Punjab. Such time also came when it was declared a district. But British rule took back the status of district and convert it into tehsil. And later on the state of tehsil also taken back and made Roorkee the tehsil.
The building which was the offices of tehsil at that time was converted into 'Middle Oriental School’. This building had been famous by name of middle school after independence.
At present there is a Masjid nearby this school which is known as "tehseel wali masjid". And where was the main center of rule it is known as the name of Quila. Which is surrounded by roads and markets. After seeing this structure it can be said there was a trench around this quila by four sides for enemies. So that enemies could not reach inside Quila.
Presently the Fort is converted into Mohalla Quila which is surrounded by following roads, Nagar Palika Chowk to Sarrafa Bazar road, Main Market to Haidri Chowk road, then mohalla malakpura to Nagar Palika Parishad road.
