The Borough of Milton Keynes is a unitary authority and borough of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire. It is the northernmost district of the South East England Region. It was originally one of five non-metropolitan districts of Buckinghamshire, but on 1 April 1997, under a recommendation of the Local Government Commission for England, it became a self-governing non-metropolitan county, independent from (the former) Buckinghamshire County Council.
The Borough abuts Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire and the remainder of the Buckinghamshire that is under the control of Buckinghamshire Council. The principal settlement in the borough is Milton Keynes itself, which accounts for about 29% of its area and 90% of its population.

The district council applied for and received borough status that year.
