Medgidia (Romanian pronunciation: [med͡ʒiˈdi.a] or [med.d͡ʒiˈdi.a]; historical Turkish names: Karasu or Carasu, Mecidiye or Megidie) is a city in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, south-eastern Romania.


== History ==
Archaeological findings show that Dobruja was inhabited since the Neolithic period. Starting with 46 BC the region was administered by the Roman Empire. A castrum was built in the Carasu Valley, becoming the cradle of the settlement.
In 1417, the Turks invaded Dobruja. From the 15th century onwards, the region started to be colonized with a Muslim population. The settlement named "Karasu" (Turkish for "Black Water") was mentioned on the map of Iehuda ben Zara in 1497, in the notes of Paolo Giorgio (1590) and Evliya Çelebi (1653).Modern Medgidia was built by the Ottoman administration on the place of the old Karasu beginning with 1856. It was built as a planned city to accommodate refugees from the Crimean War and to serve as an economic hub for the central zone of Dobruja. The town was named in honour of the sultan Abdülmecid I, the Ottoman sovereign of the period.After the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Northern Dobruja became part of Romania.


== Geography ==
Medgidia is located between the Danube and the Black Sea, 39 kilometres away from Constanța.
The general aspect of the relief is that of a low plateau with a limestone structure, covered with thick deposits of loess.
The natural resources in the area consist of limestone deposits and kaolin sand. The limestone structure of the earth permits a natural filtering of the groundwater.


== Climate ==
The climate is temperate-continental, with short and cold winters and very hot summers.


== Local administration ==
Medgidia became a municipality in 1994.
The town infrastructure is continuously developing and offers the inhabitants 4 high schools, 8 primary schools, 12 nurseries, 4 cultural centers with a hall for cultural activities, 2 show and cinema halls, 3 clubs and 5 libraries, a 30,000-seat stadium, a sports hall and a swimming pool. Medgidia also houses a 500-bed hospital.
The following villages are administered by the municipality:

== Economy ==
The economic landscape spotlights the existence of a town fully involved in its progress. Out of 1,200 registered enterprises, only 30 are state-owned and 15 are joint ventures.
Beside the agricultural activities (milk-processing, milling, bakery and wine growing), the main industry deals in cement and building materials, agricultural machinery and forging equipment, wood processing and furniture factories.
Medgidia lies in the center of an agricultural area of several tens of millions hectares, with a fertile soil and provided with irrigation systems.
The area offers:

a rich agricultural tradition and trained specialists
a road network for the transport of goods
relatively short transport distances, especially through the port
access to other Romanian or European regions
better climate conditions than in other parts of Romania (winter is shorter)
an outstanding irrigation potentialThe Medgidia clinker storage facility was completed in 2009 and is the world's largest dome-type cement clinker storage facility.


== Transport ==
The town is a road and rail node and an inland port to the Danube-Black Sea Canal. The Danube-Black Sea Canal crosses the town for about 6 km of its length.
The canal has a capacity of 11.2 million tons/year and can admit ships of 5,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT). Provided with road and rail links, the harbor offers storage facilities and cranes able to lift up to 16-ton weights. Beside a SNCFR marshaling yard, along the Canal there is a Free Trade Area in course of being finalized.
A planned highway from Bucharest to Constanţa, partially financed by the EU, will bypass the town, allowing the development of associated services (hotels, petrol stations and a parking yard for trucks) in the area.
Also, the Medgidia railway station links trains to a few, but very important towns and cities, including Constanţa (35 km), Tulcea (144 km), and Bucureşti Nord (199 km).
