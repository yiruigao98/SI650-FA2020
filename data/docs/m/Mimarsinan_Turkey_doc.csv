Melikgazi is a metropolitan district of Kayseri in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey. Along with the neighboring Kocasinan district, it was historically the core of Kayseri city, until additional districts were joined into the metropolitan area in 2004. The mayor is Memduh Büyükkıliç (AKP).
Melikgazi itself counts eight depending municipalities, some of which retain their semi-rural character, administrative boundaries of Kayseri's metropolitan area sometimes extending faster than the city itself. Melikgazi also has nine depending villages.
Among Melikgazi's municipalities, Ağırnas is particularly notable for being the birthplace of Mimar Sinan the Architect and for having preserved its historical tissue. Yet another municipality, Mimarsinan, was named after the architect.
