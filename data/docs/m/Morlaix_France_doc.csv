Morlaix (French pronunciation: ​[mɔʁlɛ]; Breton: Montroulez) is a commune in the Finistère department of Brittany in northwestern France. It is a sub-prefecture of the department.


== Leisure and tourism ==
The old quarter of the town has winding streets of cobbled stones and overhanging houses constructed of stone and timber. Many have religious and secular sculptures on their façades.
One of these houses is "la Maison dite de la duchesse Anne", or the "so-called Duchess Anne’s house", which is now a museum, open to the public. This house is said to be one of the oldest in the town. Local legend has it that it derives its name from the fact that the Duchesse Anne of Brittany visited the house during her Tro Breizh pilgrimage. This seems unlikely, though, as construction on the house started in the 1520s and Anne of Brittany died in 1514.
The Museum of the Jacobins in Morlaix, housed in a former convent, traces the history of Finistère.
Morlaix is a popular location for sea sports enthusiasts with a diverse array of activities on offer including surfing, sand buggying and kite flying. Visitors can also find beautiful coastal paths for walks. Inland activities include bowling, golf, horse-riding and many more. There are also a cinema and a swimming pool.

In 2008, 6.45% of primary-school children attended bilingual schools.The Diwan school in Morlaix, founded around 1988, was originally located in very old apartments. In January 2008 the mayor offered the Diwan school a move to a more suitable location, an empty school. In June 2008 the new mayor decided that the Diwan school should move location once again. The town council wanted to use their building to open a new public school. However the replacement building chosen for the Diwan school was in a very bad shape.
