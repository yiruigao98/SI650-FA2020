It is an extended route of Madhupur–Giridih railway line. The Koderma–Maheshmunda section falls under Dhanbad Division of East Central Railway and Giridih–Madhupur section under Asansol Division of Eastern Railway.

== History ==
The Giridih Railway Station was built as a railway siding in 1871 by the British government in India (prior to the India's independence in 1947) mainly for transport of mineral reserve from the region. The contract for the railway siding was awarded in 1865 and the construction was completed in 1871. The siding is owned by Central Coalfields Limited.


== Further extension ==
A 110 km (68 mi) track from Koderma to Maheshmunda has been constructed. A new railway station was built in Giridih named as New Giridih Station (NGRH) which leaves out the already existing station Giridih (GRD) on this route, also making Maheshmunda a junction station now. Effectively, the route extends from Koderma to Madhupur. On 16 February 2019, Eastern Railway in its press-release announced a passenger train service w.e.f. 25 February 2019 from Koderma to Madhupur via New Giridih Station. Onward journey duration is of 4 hours and 5 minutes while the return journey duration is 4 hours and 25 minutes. Eastern Railway also announced another passenger train service w.e.f. 25 February 2019 from Koderma to Maheshmunda Junction through the same press-release. Onward journey duration is of 3 hours while the return journey duration is 3 hours and 10 minutes.A Final Location Survey for 7.54 km long Madhupur bypass line was sanctioned in February 2020 after construction of which trains from Kiul and Jasidih can run upto Giridih and Koderma without loco reversal at Madhupur. The estimated cost of the linking project is Rs 281 crore.
There are plans from the Railway ministry to connect New Giridih Station with Parasnath Station via Madhuban, for the convenience of the Jain pilgrims visiting Shikharji. The foundation for the construction of new Parasnath-New Giridih rail line was laid in 2019. The 47-km long railway line would incur a cost of Rs 972 crore on its construction and will have two crossing stations and a couple of halts. The cost of the project would be borne by the central and the state government in 50:50 ratio and a target has been set to complete the project by 2023.
There are other proposals as well to connect New Giridih Station with Dhanbad Junction via Tundi and Govindpur, and with Jhajha Station via Bengabad, Chakai and Sono. The first phase of the Jhajha–New Giridih rail line involves 20-km long Jhajha–Batia section, the foundation for which was laid in 2019 and which will be constructed at a cost of Rs 496 crore.
