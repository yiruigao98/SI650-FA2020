== History ==
As capital of Bunyoro, Masindi was visited by Samuel and Florence Baker, British explorers and anti-slavery campaigners, from 25 April 1872 to 14 June 1873. The Baker expedition was forced to withdraw because of the hostility of the Omukama Kabaléga, the King of Bunyoro at the time. The White Fathers founded here a mission in the 1910s. The town was developed as a commercial centre due to trade in cotton during the second half of the 19th century.

== Challenges ==
A profile of the town written by the New Vision newspaper identified three major challenges. The first challenge was the inadequacy of income-generating projects outside of the town centre. Three out of four divisions in town; Kigulya, Karujubu and Nyagahya are unable to generate enough revenue to meet service demands. The second major challenge is the inadequacy of sanitation services. The town had five public toilets, as of November 2013, and all of them were located in the town's Central division. Masindi is serviced by National Water and Sewerage Corporation, but the services are concentrated in the town centre. The third major challenge for the town of Masindi is that of garbage disposal. The town lacked adequate funding to hire staff and purchase fuel to dispose of the town's garbage. However, the Central government had provided equipment to carry out the task.
