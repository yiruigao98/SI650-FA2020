== Overview ==

One of the notable aspects of the city in the 1960s was a series of decorated horse and buggies. Any day of the week about twenty-five such horse and carriages were mostly parked in the town center with ready drivers to serve visitors and the locals.  Destinations for such carriages included the City Park, called "Park-e Malyer".  "Park-e Malayer", situated a couple of miles outside the city, contained a number of small lakes, vegetation, ducks, trees and shrubbery. Hamedan province is situated in a semi arid region.  Thus "Park-e Malayer" with its natural environment and lush vegetation was an inviting environment in the region. During hot summers, people would spend some time in Malayer to enjoy the "Horse and Buggy" ride and rest at the park. People in Malayer speak the Central dialect of Luri, a language related to Luri.
"Park-e Malayer" has been named from tens years ago "Park e Seifieh" that refers to the name of a Ghajar prince (Seyfodoleh) who built the park around 75 years ago. He buried at a family tomb located near to the park.
During the Ottoman-Persian War, the valley near the city hosted the Battle of Malayer, a strategic victory for the Persians, and one of the first battles led by the conqueror Nader Shah.
