The indigenous people living here are the Rana-Tharus but people from other parts mostly from the hill districts Baitadi, Darchula and Dadeldhura find themselves at home. Bheemdatt has become a unique combination of ethnic groups which has a different way of life within an already diverse country Nepal. The festivals celebrated by the ethnic Tharu people are Holi and Maghi. Tharu people celebrate Maghi as New year, while Hill People primarily celebrate Gora (commonly called Gaura Parba). Deepawali or Diwali or Tihar is a major festival which is celebrated with Laxmi Puja, Gai Puja, and Bhai Tika on their respective days. Dashain is also a major festival here. Small population from western Nepal mainly arghakhachi, gulmi, pyuthan etc have settled here (mostly in bhasi), even before local people of the same region settled from the hills of Far-west Nepal.
