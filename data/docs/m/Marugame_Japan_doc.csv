== History ==
Marugame was founded in April, 1899 during the Meiji era. Marugame was the 53rd city to be given a city code in Japan. From the 1940s to 1950s (during the Shōwa era) the southeast area of the city and some islands were amalgamated to form new parts of the city. In 1999 (the 11th year of the Heisei era) Marugame celebrated its 100th anniversary.
On March 22, 2005, the towns of Ayauta and Hanzan (both from Ayauta District) were merged into Marugame to create the current expanded city of Marugame.

The former Ayauta was founded in 1959 (the 34th year of the Shōwa era) with the amalgamation of the villages of Kumatama and Okada. Kumatama was in turn founded with the amalgamation of the villages of Kurikuma and Tomikuma in 1951.
The former Hanzan was founded in 1956 (the 31st year of the Shōwa era) with the amalgamation of the villages of Sakamoto and Hokunji.

== Economy ==
The economy produces chemicals, textiles, fans, salt, rice and barley. In the early 1980s, large coastal salt fields were reclaimed from the sea to stimulate further economic development. The city's importance as a port for pilgrims coming from the Kyōto and Ōsaka areas to worship at the Kompira Shrine in Kotohira (from the Tokugawa period to the early Meiji period) declined with the opening of the railway between Matsuyama and Takamatsu in 1889 and more recently with the development of bus and air service linking Kotohira with major cities.
