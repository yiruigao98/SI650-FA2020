El Masnou (pronounced [əl məzˈnɔw]; Catalan for '"the new farmhouse"') is a municipality in the province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is situated on the coast between Montgat and Premià de Mar, to the north-east of the city of Barcelona, in the comarca (county) of el Maresme. The town is both a tourist centre and a dormitory town in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area.
The main N-II road and a RENFE railway line run through the town, while a local road links it with the A-19 autopista at 
Alella.
The town center has buildings in a wide range of styles: neoclassical, modernista, noucentista 
and simply eclectic. The municipal museum has collections of archeology and of Catalan ceramics, and there is also a private 
museum of pharmacy and medicine.  A Roman village called Cal Ros de les Cabres was one of the first settlements located on the site of the current
town.
The agriculture of El Masnou is mainly of flowers, especially carnations, and the industry has a predominance of textile, with several industries about ceramics, glass and pharmaceutical products.
