El Tocuyo is a fertile valley and city in west-central Venezuela at 622 m (2,041 ft) elevation. It is located in south-central Lara State about 60 km southwest of Barquisimeto.  The town of El Tocuyo was founded by Juan de Carvajal in 1545 on the banks of the Tocuyo River and it was the administrative capital of Venezuela Province from 1546 to 1548.  Its original name was Nuestra Se침ora de la Pura y Limpia Concepci칩n del Tocuyo.  El Tocuyo is now just the municipal seat of Mor치n. Its population is 41,327 (2001).
The surrounding area has good soil and an ideal climate for agriculture, dry and warm with plenty of water available from the Tocuyo River.  The area has been occupied since prehistoric times. When the Spanish arrived they found the Gayones Indians, who inhabited this valley, sowing corn and other agricultural products as cotton and yucca. After the Spanish came, sugar cane was, for centuries, the biggest crop; but since 1980 vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, chiles, and potatoes are taking its place.
