== The town of Ede ==


=== Location ===

The town itself is situated halfway between the larger cities of Arnhem and Utrecht, with direct rail and road connections to both cities. There are no connections to any water nearby; however, there also is a direct road connection to the city of Wageningen which hosts a small industrial port on the river Rijn and a direct road and rail connection to the city of Arnhem, which features a larger port at a greater distance. The environment is clean and green due to the fact that Ede is partly built in a forest and partly on the central Dutch plains in the national park called Nationaal Park "De Hoge Veluwe".


=== Economy ===
Economically, the town of Ede is doing fairly well thanks to the proximity of major highways and railways which offer fast connections to the port of Rotterdam, Schiphol airport and the Ruhr Area in Germany. The main sources of employment used to be a factory belonging to the Dutch Enka company and the three military bases situated in the east of the town. The factory, however, has been closed and the military bases are largely underused since conscription was abolished. The town's economy is lately becoming more focused on national tourism from the more densely populated western cities like Amsterdam and Den Haag, and on education such as local colleges and the large Wageningen University in the city of Wageningen.
Some of the more notable or larger companies and other employers in and around Ede are:

Fruit juice and drinks-factory Riedel, now part of FrieslandCampina.

There are four secondary schools in Ede: Marnix College, Pallas Athene College, two divisions of Het Streek, and  Aeres VMBO. In addition, Ede has a university of applied sciences, the Christian University of Applied Sciences Ede (Christelijke Hogeschool Ede).Recently, a primary college focused on the equivalent of basic education named Technova College (formerly known as ROC A12) has been gaining interest and popularity since renovations started in 2015.


=== Social life ===
Each year, in the last week of August, there is a municipality-wide celebration called Heideweek (Week of the heather). It largely involves traditional Dutch festivities, along with local customs.
