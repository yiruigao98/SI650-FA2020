== Police Misconduct Allegations ==
On February 24, 2019, police officers, named Jack Asquini, Jason Pena, Travis Staes, Ethan Bush, as well as two unidentified other officers, arrested a black college swimmer, Jaylan Butler, at gunpoint in an incident which has provoked a lawsuit from the ACLU. Butler claims in the lawsuit that as he stopped to take a selfie next to a sign, police officers pulled up and held him at gunpoint, telling him not to move and to get down. The officers forced Butler to lay down on the snowy ground, restrained him with handcuffs, and knelt on his back. After being informed that Butler was not the suspect the officers were looking for, the officers placed Butler in a police car, telling him he was being arrested for resisting arrest. The lawsuit accuses the six officers of excessive force, assault, battery, false arrest and other counts.


=== Inconsistencies in police statements ===
The East Moline Chief of Police, Jeff Ramsay, said in a statement that the lawsuit was without merit. However, official exculpatory statements given by police officers contradict evidence in several ways. Officer Staes, in his response to the lawsuit, says that the claim that officers exited their car and pointed their weapons at Butler is false. However, Staes' police report from the night of the incident says that both he and Bush pointed their weapons at Butler to give him orders. Additionally, officer Bush says that a claim in the lawsuit that he was carrying a rifle is false. However, Bush's police report says that his body camera was accidentally turned off due to his "AR-15 sling making contact with the on/off switch". All officers deny the claim that one officer told Butler “If you keep moving, I’m going to blow your fucking head off.” However, Bush's police report does confirm that the officers threatened to shoot Butler. While all officers deny that they pressed their knee into Butler's back, Asquini's report admits that he did press his knee into a suspect's back while restraining him. And finally, while all officers deny that Butler was ignored when he said he wanted to file a complaint about being racially profiled, Bush's original report states that Butler said he would be filing a complaint. Despite this, in court documents Bush submitted a statement saying “Defendant denies that he was told Plaintiff [sic] by Plaintiff that he wanted to make a complaint.”
