== History ==
El Cerrito was founded by refugees from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. They settled in what was then Don Víctor Castro's Rancho San Pablo, and adjacent to the ranch owned by the family of Luís María Peralta, the Rancho San Antonio. A post office opened at the settlement in 1909 and the refugee camp became known as Rust, after Wilhelm F. Rust, its first postmaster. The village's residents did not care for the name and changed it to El Cerrito (meaning "little hill" or "knoll") in 1916, in reference to the many individual hills in the village. A year later, El Cerrito was incorporated as a village with 1,500 residents.El Cerrito was incorporated in August 1917.  The communities of Stege Junction, Rust, Schmidtville, and Schindler, were all included in the new city. The 1920 census shows that the Schmidtville community had many Italian immigrants.   A post office operated at Schmidtville from 1900 to 1901.
