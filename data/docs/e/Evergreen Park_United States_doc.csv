== History ==
As early as 1828, a German farming family had settled in the area of what is now Evergreen Park. In the succeeding decades, other German immigrants arrived. Kedzie Avenue and 95th Street crisscrossed the farmland and provided access to markets.
The first railroad (now the Grand Trunk Railroad) came through the area in 1873. In 1875, the community built its first school just west of 95th and Kedzie. The school and the stores that began to cluster around this intersection defined the community's main business area. Nearby, a real-estate developer, with a vision of the Arc de Triomphe area of Paris, laid out a star-shaped park with eight streets radiating from it. The evergreen trees planted in the park inspired the village's name. The location and layout of the park was intended to be the center of town, but 95th St and Kedzie Ave. later proved a more accurate midpoint.  After the death of Mayor Henry Klein shortly after the village's 75th anniversary, the park was renamed Klein Park in his honor.In 1888 St. Mary's Cemetery opened, and mourners traveled by train from Chicago. Restaurants and taverns were created to provide meals for cemetery visitors. Within five years, the village had become a recreation center that attracted hundreds of Chicagoans to its picnic groves, beer gardens, and dance halls.  The first of the village's 13 churches was established in 1893.
As a result of the financial panic of the 1890s, several surrounding communities voted to be annexed by Chicago.  Realizing the current and future potential of its strong business district, and in order to avoid annexation during the serious economic crisis, The Village of Evergreen Park declared its independence and was incorporated on December 20, 1893. Prior to its incorporation, the village was sustained by approximately 500 regional residents. The final decision to incorporate as its own entity separate from the City of Chicago was made by a 41 out of 50 approval by village residents.  John M. Foley, a real estate and insurance agent, became the village's first mayor. During the 1890s, The Village of Evergreen Park officially occupied an area of four square miles; it now covers an area of the same size.In 1899, shortly after its incorporation, the village introduced telephone services to the community.  In 1910, gas and electric lines were extended into homes and street lights were erected.   By 1920, most of the village's homes had indoor plumbing, although some residents still used a well located behind the village hall as their water source.In the early 20th century, many residents still farmed and there were many open fields within the town limits.  As a result, fire was a constant threat and the water supply was scarce.  In July 1918, a spark from a passing train set the original village hall on fire.  Despite villagers' attempts to douse the flames, the village hall was destroyed.  In 1920, a new village hall and the population grew to 800.In 1930, Little Company of Mary Hospital was opened at 95th and California.  Within the first year of its inception, 232 babies were born.While the village remains small in size, it is only seventeen miles southwest of the Loop. The Village is also currently surrounded by Chicago on the north, south, and east sides. Evergreen Park is also known as the "Village of Churches" because of its thirteen established religious congregations within close proximity.


== First successful organ transplant ==
Little Company of Mary Hospital, located at 2800 W. 95th St. in Evergreen Park, was the site of the world's first successful organ transplant. The pioneering procedure took place on June 17, 1950. Dr. Edward T. Maloney (1896–1982), a highly regarded general surgeon, led a team of doctors that performed the highly risky, controversial, and experimental operation.   Dr. Lawler spent a number of years researching the possibility of organ transplantation and concluded the most probable means of achieving success for a patient would involve the kidney.  After successfully practicing the procedure with dogs and realizing he had the opportunity to "get it all started", Maloney decided to attempt the medical-first and searched for a desperate patient in dire need of a new kidney. The recipient of Maloney's first organ transplantation was Ruth Tucker, a 49-year-old Chicago-area woman who suffered from terminal polycystic kidney disease.


== Historical landmarks ==
Evergreen Plaza, "The Plaza"The Evergreen Plaza, located on 95th and Western, was an indoor shopping mall originating from the early 1950s. In 1952, real estate developer Arthur Rubloff debuted the Evergreen Plaza in the heart of the southwest Chicago suburbs. A few years after the shopping mall's debut, Rubloff decided to enclose the mall thereby making it the first indoor shopping mall in the Chicago area. As a result, Rubloff changed shopping by allowing people the opportunity to pull up, park, and shop for various goods all in one place. Since the 1950s the Evergreen Park Plaza had seen more than $8 million in major internal & external improvements. Evergreen Plaza was shortened to be acknowledged as, "The Plaza". The Plaza covered 1,200,000 square feet (110,000 m2), and two stories. As of 2006, The Plaza had an annual visitor count of roughly 7 million people. The Plaza closed on May 31, 2013, after 61 years of operation and is presently under construction for re-development. The Plaza, in its new form, re-opened on October 18, 2018 and was renamed the Evergreen Marketplace.
