El Reno is a city in and county seat of Canadian County, Oklahoma, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 16,729. The city was begun shortly after the 1889 land rush and named for the nearby Fort Reno. It is located in Central Oklahoma, about 25 miles (40 km) west of downtown Oklahoma City.


== History ==

The city was originally located about 5 miles (8.0 km) north of its present location, on the banks of the North Canadian River, bearing the name Reno City, which caused its mail to get mixed up with mail for Reno, Nevada.  After the second time the town flooded, it was moved to its present location and changed its name to El Reno. This word is Spanish for "the reindeer". The town, however, got its name from the nearby Fort Reno; reindeer are not native to Oklahoma.
Originally, the land of Canadian County belonged to Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, but in 1874, Fort Reno was established and General Philip Sheridan took commanded. Sheridan named the fort in honor of his friend, Gen. Jesse L. Reno, who was killed in the American Civil War. The grounds of the old fort became home to a research laboratory for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1948. The laboratory studies environmentally sustainable forage and livestock production, contributing to preservation of the Great Plains of North America.
El Reno is located on the 98th meridian west, which allowed the eastern side to be opened to non-Indian settlement in the Land Rush of 1889. The western side was opened in the 1892 opening of the Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. It was subsequently selected as the land district office for the 1901 land lottery drawings.During World War II, Fort Reno, about 5 mi (8.0 km) northwest of El Reno, was the site of a prisoner of war camp, and today contains a POW cemetery, with stones bearing the names of German and Italian prisoners who died there.
Southwestern Federal Reformatory, restricted to male prisoners under the age of 35, was constructed about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of El Reno in 1935. Renamed the Federal Correctional Institution of El Reno in the mid-1970s, the population expanded to include men of all ages. It became the fifth-largest prison in the U.S. It is still one of the largest employers in El Reno.El Reno is one of few cities in Oklahoma to have a streetcar in operation in the downtown area: the Heritage Express Trolley At one time, the city possessed a terminal and repair facility for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&P or "Rock Island"), which employed a large number of people.  The CRI&P went bankrupt in 1979. The railyards have remained vacant property. The old train depot and some other buildings were acquired by the Canadian County Historical Society for use as part of a museum complex. The 1954 film noir Human Desire includes locomotive and yard scenes filmed in the El Reno rail yards.
El Reno is a Main Street community. The Oklahoma Main Street Program is a downtown revitalization program and the El Reno Program won the Great American Main Street Award in 2006.
The town is noted for its annual Fried Onion Burger Day Festival, which is always the first Saturday in May. Burger Day is when visitors can witness the cooking of the world's largest fried onion hamburger, weighing over 850 lb (390 kg). The giant burger contains all the important parts of the famous El Reno fried onion burgers, which include meat, fried onions, sliced pickles, and mustard all between two giant buns. Not only do festival goers get to watch the massive burger be built and cooked, but they are also allowed to help eat the monstrosity. Volunteers divide the giant burger into individual-sized portions with burger-sized cookie cutters. Other volunteers shuttle back and forth from the burger to the crowd, delivering the free portions to anyone wanting a piece. The idea of the fried onion burger was born out of necessity during the Great Depression, when onions were used to stretch out the meat supply.
On June 15, 2015, Sid's Diner was featured on the Food Network series Top 5 Restaurants, with the fried-onion burger being highlighted. Sid's Diner has also been featured on the Travel Channel series Man v. Food.
