== Emerging and growth-leading economies (EAGLEs) ==
Emerging and growth-leading economies (EAGLEs) are a grouping of key emerging markets developed by BBVA Research.  The EAGLE economies are expected to lead global growth in the next 10 years, and to provide important opportunities for investors.


=== EAGLEs ===

EAGLEs is a grouping acronym created in late 2010 by BBVA Research to identify all emerging economies, whose contribution to world economic growth in the next ten years is expected to be larger than the average of the G6 economies (G7 excluding the U.S.). This is a dynamic concept where country members can change over time according to their forecasted performance relative to developed economies. The membership of the EAGLEs is subjected to a yearly revision and can change according to their forecasted economic performances relative to developed economies. 


=== Nest ===
As part of the EAGLEs proposal, the EAGLEs’ Nest is a second set of countries with expected Incremental GDP in the next decade to be lower than the average of the G6 economies (G7 excluding the U.S.) but higher than Italy’s (G6 Minimum), the country which is anticipated to contribute least to global growth within the G7. The membership of the EAGLEs’ Nest is subject to a yearly revision and can change according to forecasted economic performances.


=== Indexes ===
On September 9, 2011, Dow Jones and BBVA launched two equity indexes that allow investing in leading companies traded in Emerging and Growth-Leading Economies (EAGLEs). There are two indexes, “Dow Jones BBVA EAGLEs” and “Dow Jones BBVA EAGLEs Optimized”, both composed of a set of 50 companies.
The allocation by country is macro driven according to the contribution each EAGLE is going to make to incremental GDP within the group, in the next ten years. It is a dynamic index which changes its composition along with macro forecasts; hence it is an adaptive index when compared with other static peers. Revisions are made annually in March to update the indices compositions according to the latest macroeconomic forecasts. It is also a liquid index which provides a diversified exposure to Emerging Markets. In order to facilitate index replication by foreign investment firms, the sample of 50 companies is chosen from the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index, plus HK and US listed Chinese companies.
