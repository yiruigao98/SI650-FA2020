The history of Evergem goes back ago a long time.
In the 1st world war, Ertvelde was used as a blockade in case the Netherlands attacked from the north. Ertvelde has a lot of bunkers due that, almost every 200m you can find one. Now they're mostly on fields used by farmers. The government decided that the bunkers are from the people where it stand. Some farmers destroyed it and some use it as storage, but some are still visitable.
