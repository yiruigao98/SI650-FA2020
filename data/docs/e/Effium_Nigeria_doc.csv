== Natural resources ==
Ebonyi is primarily an agricultural region. It is a leading producer of rice, yam, potatoes, maize, beans, and cassava in Nigeria. Rice is predominantly cultivated in Ikwo, yams in Izzi, with other regions in the state such as Amasiri, Edda and Ezillo making notable contributions, and Effium and Ezzamgb taking the top spots in cassava production. Ebonyi has several solid mineral resources, including lead, crude oil, and natural gas, but few large-scale commercial mining|mines. The state government has, however, given some incentives to investors in the agro-allied sector to encourage production but capacity remains largely under utilised. Ebonyi is called "the salt of the nation" for its huge salt deposit at the Okposi and Uburu Salt Lakes. There are also some tourist locations within the state prominent ones include Abakaliki Green Lake, Uburu Salt Lake, Unwana and Ikwo Beaches.
