Eidelstedt  is a quarter of Hamburg, Germany, in the borough of Eimsbüttel. It is located on the northwestern boundaries of the borough and of the city. 


== Geography ==
Eidelstedt borders the quarters of Schnelsen, Niendorf, Stellingen, as well as Bahrenfeld and Lurup in the neighbouring Altona borough.


== History ==
In 1266/69 Eidelstedt was first recorded as a village, then under the names of Eilstede, Eylstedt or Eylenstede. The part -stedt in the name refers to a Saxonian foundation, meaning safe settlement or safe residence, which was founded by a first settler named Eyler. Another explanation derives from Ilenstätten, referring to a place (German: Stätte), where medicinal leeches (German: Egel, Blutegel, Low German: Ilen) could be found, namely in a stream called Mühlenau and the pond of Mühlenteich in the village. In 1937, the village was incorporated into Hamburg by the Greater Hamburg Act, which came into force in 1938.


== Transportation ==
The Hamburg-Altona–Kiel railway marks the south western boundaries of the quarter, with Hamburg S-Bahn commuter trains serve Elbgaustraße and Eidelstedt station; the latter is also served by AKN commuter trains. AKN railcars also call Eidelstedt Zentrum station.
