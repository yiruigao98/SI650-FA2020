Since the appointment of Orinoco Belt as one of the largest reserves of oil in the world, El Tigre has become one of the most important cities in Venezuela because it is very near or on the edge of this oil belt in Anzoategui state. Thus, El Tigre currently shows an increase in the establishment of companies of services to the oil industry that is constantly growing and have also been presented innumerable construction projects for new shopping malls, business buildings or towers and other works for the significant activation of tourism.


== History ==
In the 1930s a large field of light crude oil was discovered near El Tigrito by the Mene Grande Oil Company (MGO), a subsidiary of Gulf Oil Corporation.  The Oficina No. 1 well, a wildcat well begun in 1933 and completed in 1937, established the highly productive Oficina Formation. The oil discovery led to the founding of El Tigre on February 23, 1933 when Mene Grande established their offices in Campo Oficina.  El Tigre quickly became a boomtown.  The name "Oficina" (Office) was derived from the telegraph office in El Tigrito. Until the oil discovery, the area had been sparsely populated. By 1940 a road and an oil pipeline had been constructed to connect El Tigre with Puerto La Cruz.  By 1946, 512 wells had been drilled, and the region had produced 127 million barrels of oil.  The nearby oil company camp San Tomé was built near El Tigre as the main camp for Mene Grande.
