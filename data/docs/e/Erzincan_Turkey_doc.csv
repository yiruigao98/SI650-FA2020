In September 1935 the third Inspectorate General (Umumi Müfettişlik, UM) was created, into which the Erzincan province was included. Its creation was based on the Law 1164 from June 1927, which was passed in order to Turkefy the population. The Erzincan province was included in this area. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars, Gümüşhane, Erzincan and Ağrı. It was governed by an Inspector General seated in the city of Erzurum.  In January 1936, a Fourth Inspectorate-General was established, under which authority the province was transferred. The fourth UM included the provinces of Erzincan, Tunceli, Elazığ and the areas which would become the province of Bingöl. The Fourth UM was governed by a Governor Commander. Most of the employees in the municipalities were to be from the military and the Governor Commander had the authority to evacuate whole villages and resettle them in other areas. The Inspectorates General were dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.
