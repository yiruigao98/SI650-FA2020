In 1889, Lars Åkerman, who was previously a co-owner of Hvilans Mekaniska Verkstad in Kristianstad, bought the company and named it Åkermans Gjuteri and Mekaniska Verkstad. Åkerman died in 1897 and the following year the company was converted to Aktiebolaget Åkermans Gjuteri and Mekaniska Verkstad. During the 1920s, road rollers and graders were manufactured. In 1938, Åkermans moved from central Eslöv, where Medborgarhuset is today, to premises on Bruksgatan in eastern Eslöv. From 1939, Åkermans began producing excavators, the product that made the company internationally known. The first excavator, an Åkerman 300, was delivered to Sjöbo Cementgjuteri. In December 1965 Åkermans was introduced to the stock exchange. On December 1, 1998, Volvo Excavator (formerly Åkermans) announced that it was planning to shut down its production of excavators in Eslöv and thus a successful epoch of Eslöv's industrial history in the grave.
