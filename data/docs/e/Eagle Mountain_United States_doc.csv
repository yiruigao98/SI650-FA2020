Eagle Mountain is a city in Utah County, Utah, United States. It is part of the Provo–Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is located to the west as well as north of the Lake Mountains, which are west of Utah Lake. It was incorporated December 3, 1996 and has been rapidly growing ever since. The population was 21,415 at the 2010 census.  Although Eagle Mountain was a town in 2000, it has since been classified as a fourth-class city by state law.  In its short history, the city has quickly become known for its rapid growth.


== History ==
The area is home to a number of natural landmarks, including a site along the original Pony Express trail and 1,800-year-old rock art petroglyphs carved by ancient Fremont Indians. In 2011 Eagle Mountain extended further west with the annexation of the White Hills neighborhood, which had about 400 residents, as well as an area that is part of the Pole Canyon development plan. The land outside of White Hills was almost 2,900 acres.


== Geography ==
Eagle Mountain is located at the western and northern bases of the Lake Mountains in the flat Cedar Valley east, and northeast of the town of Cedar Fort. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 41.7 square miles (108.0 km2).


== Climate ==
Eagle Mountain's climate varies drastically between the northeastern Ranches area and southwestern City Center area. Despite being further south than Salt Lake City, both areas have cooler temperatures due to sitting at a higher elevation. The Ranches section of the city has slightly milder temperatures since it is closer to the moderating impact of the Salt Lake Valley and Great Salt Lake which gives it a climate closer to Salt Lake City. The City Center area near Fairfield lies in the Cedar Valley which cuts that area off from the moderating influence of the Salt Lake Valley and Great Salt lake. This causes nights to get significantly colder than in the Ranches but also puts it in a rain shadow causing less precipitation and more sunshine than the Ranches part of the city.
Under the Köppen climate classification, the climate of the Ranches area is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) or hot-summer humid continental (Dfa) depending on which variant of the system is used. The City Center area is drier and cooler. The Köppen classification for this area is cold semi-arid (BSk), although rainfall is nearly enough to classify the area as warm-summer humid continental (Dfb).
