== History ==
The town traces its beginnings to the middle of the eighteenth century.  Explorers arrived and camped on the banks of a small river.  The climate was mild, there was abundant water, and the lands were fertile.  But the site had one defect: it was infested by clouds of a blood-sucking mosquito called Mutuca.  For this reason the river and the lands nearby were given the name "Mutuca".
1792 is the first date known in an authentic document referring to the existence of the town.  The first settlement of Mutuca changed its name to  Espírito Santo da Mutuca, later Espírito Santo do Pontal, and later reducing the name to Pontal.  In 1911 it got its municipal emancipation from Varginha.  The name, Pontal, was changed to Eloy Mendes in honor of Major Joaquim Eloy Mendes (1827–1913), who was an important local figure and a baron in the Empire of Brazil with the title of Baron of Varginha.   Later with modern spelling the name was changed to Elói Mendes.


== Tourism ==
