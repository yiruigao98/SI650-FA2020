== History ==
The city was founded by Barsham (Haskanet) bin Abd al-Hamid (Archived 18 June 2013 on the Wayback Machine) and the Rizeigat tribe to which Madboo bin Ali bin Barsham belonged settled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries AD. The city's history witnessed clashes between it and the rulers and tribes of the neighboring regions, such as the Fur tribe in western Sudan and the Dinka in southern Sudan, where Sultan Terab led a failed campaign against them in 1752-1787 AD. The last battles of the Sultans of Fur against Rizeigat were the Ali Dinar campaign in 1915.
Rizeigat joined the Mahdist Revolution in Sudan and pledged allegiance to the Mahdi in Mount Qadeer in 1882 AD and their leader Maddo participated in the Shalali battle that the Mahdi led against the soldiers of Turkish-Egyptian rule in the region.
