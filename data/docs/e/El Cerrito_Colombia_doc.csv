== A brief history ==

Sebastián de Belalcázar and his troops conquered this territory, that was populated by Native Pijaos, whounder the command of cacique Calarcá were submitted by the Europeans.
An important figure in the era of conquest is Maria Luisa de la Espada, who was born in Canton Buga. Daughter of a Spaniard, she inherited the family's trust, writing a story and legend of charm that attracts thousands of tourists to walk the roads that climb to the district of Tenerife to visit the many houses on the road and the ruins of her castle.
In the region of Guazábara -where the Amerindians worshiped the tree "Totujandi"- Captain Gregorio de Astigarreta built the hacienda San Jerónimo de los Ingenios, that was placed in jurisdiction of Guacari county, and where the village originally settled in 1797. The Cabildo of Cali created Pantanillo county with jurisdiction between the rivers Las Guabas and Nima, and in 1821 it was transferred
to the Canton of Buga, then it was finally moved to the land that was donated by ladies Petrona and Sebastiana Cárdenas.

By Ordinance No. 21 of October 14, 1854 of the Legislature of Cauca, declared the creation of a district named Guzmán, as homage to the forementioned priest.

José María Cabal (general during the War of Independence of Nueva Granada) born in the hacienda de la Concepción del Alisal, El Cerrito on 25 May 1769 (when it belonged to the canton of Buga, which is why he is honored to Buga). He participated with Antonio Nariño in the enactment of Human Rights, and for this case he was confined to Europe. He fought against Juan Samano in Cauca, defending the city of Popayán, won the battle of Río Palo, in the municipality of Caloto, Cauca. Later he returned to his hacienda, where he was captured and transferred to Popayán; there he was shot on the main square, 19 August 1816.
María Antonia Ruiz, the "black heroine", grown on the hacienda of San Agustín; after the beginning of the independence movements, she vowed to Colonel Joaquín Riascos that she would give his life if necessary for freedom. When the Royalist troops led by Simón Muñoz came to the hacienda, María Antonia went with a group of soldiers armed with a drum and a battle trumpet, shouting: "Long live the Motherland," "Long live the victorious Army of Boyacá!" "Long live the Free Cauca." Muñoz -who thought it was the whole Republican Army- then withdrew to Bermúdez Tulu. Thanks to this heroic act, Simón Bolívar himself visited her in her hacienda in San Agustín.
