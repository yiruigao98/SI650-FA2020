The first mention of this town in a document dates back to 1091, however it is much older. It was the seat of the counts of Hochberg, a cadet branch of the Margraviate of Baden. In 1418 it received market rights from the emperor, and in 1590 was raised to the status of a town, and walled, by Margrave Jacob III.The author Johann Georg Schlosser (1739–1799), a brother-in-law of Goethe, was Oberamtmann (bailiff) for a few years.There was also a neighboring town called Nieder-Emmendingen. The towns merged in 1883.

2014 local election
The local election with a voter turnout of 46.80% (2009: 48.5%) led to the following results:


=== Mayor ===
A mayor and twelve counsels have led the city since 1590. The day-to-day affairs were taken care of by the city clerk. The councillors were also judges, who met several times a year for sessions, appointed Schultheißen by the margrave. In the 18th century there were deputies in addition to the council and the mayor. Since the 19th century there has only been a mayor and the local councillors. Since the promotion of Emmendingen to a large district capital, the district leader has the official title of "Oberbürgermeister" (a mayor of an administrative region). This position is now directly elected by the electorate for a term of office of eight years. He is chairman of the local council. The general deputy is the 1st council member with the official title of "Mayor".

Together with the municipalities of Freiamt, Teningen, Teningen, and Sexau, the city of Emmendingen forms the association of administrations which began on 1 January 1975 for the purpose of the establishment of the land use plan for the districts of the participating municipalities.
Coat of arms
The Coat of arms of the city of Emmendingen depicts a red bend in a gold escutcheon (which is the old coat of arms for Baden), an armoured knight on a blue background with a silver rod in his right hand and his left hand on a silver sword hanging around his waist. The city flag is blue, yellow, and red. The coat of arms was adopted during the elevation of the city to a district capital. It depicts the symbol of the coat of arms of the local lord (the bend) and the knight which symbolises the ability to put up a fight. Previously, instead of the knight, a ploughshare was printed in the seals. Initially the knight stood on a trimount. The current depiction was adopted in 1960.


== Geography ==
The town lies in Breisgau, between the foothills of the Black Forest and the Kaiserstuhl which rises out of the Rhine plain to the north of Freiburg. The land is between 189-368m (620–1200 ft) high. On the western edge of Emmendingen flows the Elz river, which divides shortly after its confluence with the Dreisam and Glotter near Riegel, into the Old Elz and the Leopoldskanal, which both flow into the Rhine. The Leopoldskanal was built in the middle 19th century.


=== Climate ===
The climate in this area is close to a mediterrean microclimate, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. However, more year-round rain occurs than in the Rhine plateau because of the closeness to the Black Forest.  The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is "Cfb" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate). However, it is close to being humid subtropical (Cfa) due to the mean temperatures in July and August just under 22 °C. The city is close to the Kaiserstuhl, a range of hills of volcanic origin located a few miles away which is considered to be one of the warmest places of Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area.
