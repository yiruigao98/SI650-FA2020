Modern Ereğli is the home of Erdemir, an important steel plant of Turkey. It has a large natural harbour, located in the lee of Baba Burnu and therefore one of the few geographically attractive places for a harbour on the western Black Sea coast of Turkey. Ereğli is well developed due to the presence of the steel plant and fishing is a major commercial activity in the city   Because of its Black Sea beach, Ereğli is a popular tourist destination locally. The city does not have an airport (Erdemir has a small private field) or rail station, but can be reached by automobile or bus from Ankara, Istanbul and other places.
In addition to its fishing and steel, Ereğli is also well known for its delicious Ottoman strawberry.

The International Love, Peace, Friendship, Culture and Art Festival is held every year in the Karadeniz Eregli.


== History ==

The city was a Greek city in ancient times known as Heraclea Pontica after the Greek mythical hero Heracles. The Turkish name Karadeniz Ereğli means "Black Sea Ereğli" (kara="black", deniz="sea"), which distinguishes it from other places called Ereğli (the name Ereğli derives from Heraclea).
It was founded by a Megarian colony, which soon subjugated the native Mariandynians and extended its power over a considerable territory. The prosperity of the city, rudely shaken by the Galatians and the Bithynians, was utterly destroyed in the Mithridatic Wars. It was the birthplace of Heraclides Ponticus. According to Greek mythology, the cave guarded by the three-headed dog Cerberus is located near the town. For his final quest, Heracles is tasked with entering the cave and capturing Cerberus.
In the late 19th and early 20th century, Karadeniz Ereğli was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.
