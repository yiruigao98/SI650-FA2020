== History ==
Efon Alaaye dates back to 1200 A.D. In accordance with the historical facts, the founder and the first Alaaye (the title of Efon Alaaye Kings) of Efon Alaaye was Obalufon Alaayemore who was the third king or Ooni (title of Ile Ife kings) of Ile Ife, the cradle of Yoruba race. His father was the founder and father of the Yorubas and is known as Oduduwa or Odua. Obalufon Alaayemore installed his son Adudu Oranku to reign after him when he departed Efon Alaaye to go and ascend the throne in Ile Ife.
The founder of Efon Alaaye was about the only known king who reigned over two kingdoms with one of the kingdoms twice in his lifetime. He first ruled as the third Ooni of Ile- Ife having succeeded his father Obalufon Ogbogbodirin but vacated the throne on the advice of the Ile- Ife king makers for his uncle the Ife War Hero, ORANMIYAN who became the fourth Ooni of Ife. Obalufon Alayemore thereafter went and founded the kingdom of Efon Alaaye after vacating the Ile-Ife throne. He was called back to Ile- Ife by the king makers to become the fifth Ooni after the death of ORANMIYAN.
