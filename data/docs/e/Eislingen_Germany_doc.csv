Eislingen is a town in the district of Göppingen in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.


== History ==
Southern Eislingen (Kleineislingen) became a possession Württemberg in 1492 while Northern Eislingen (Großeislingen) was annexed by the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg. The period of municipal division brought about strife between local Imperial Knights (Reichsritter) until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803. The events of Protestant Reformation in Germany brought another third of Eislingen under the sovereignty of the Duchy of Württemberg and joint control with Würzburg with the rest of the city. In 1802, Würzburg was annexed by the Electorate of Bavaria. This, by extension, made Northern Eislingen a Bavarian possession until it was ceded in 1806 to the now Kingdom of Württemberg. Stuttgart assigned Eislingen to Oberamt Göppingen, a district was reorganized in 1938 as Landkreis Göppingen. Northern and Southern Eislingen united into a single city, named Eislingen-Fils, in 1933. The town of Krummwälden was incorporated into Eislingen in 1935. The construction of the Fils Valley Railway through Eislingen in 1845 began a period of industrialization and population expansion that continued after World War II and would make Eislingen the most densely populated municipality in Göppingen's jurisdiction. Eislingen was declared a major town, or Große Kreisstadt, in 2012.

=== Coat of arms ===
Eislingen's coat of arms is divided party per cross into four sections, two white and two blue. In the upper half of the blazon is a stag antler that alternates between white and blue as it crosses into different fields. This pattern was the coat of arms of Northern Eislingen and it was re-adopted by the city of Eislingen when it merged with Southern Eislingen in 1933. The blue-white tincture is a reference to the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg, and the stag antler to Württemberg. The stag antler was black until 1955.
