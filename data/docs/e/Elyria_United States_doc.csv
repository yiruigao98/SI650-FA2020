Elyria ( ə-LEER-ee-ə) is a city in the Greater Cleveland metropolitan statistical area and the county seat of Lorain County, Ohio, United States, located at the forks of the Black River in Northeast Ohio 23 miles southwest of Cleveland. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 54,533. The city is home to Lorain County Community College.


== Etymology ==
The city's name is derived from the surname of its founder, Heman Ely, and Illyria, the historical name used by ancient Greeks and Romans to refer to the western Balkans.


== History ==
The village of Elyria was officially founded in 1817 by Heman Ely, who built a log house, dam, gristmill and sawmill on the village's site along the Black River. Ely began to build more houses to accommodate European-American settlers migrating to what was, at that time, within Huron County, Ohio. By the time Ely died in 1852, Elyria had five churches, three grocery stores, three flour mills, a newspaper, and a population of more than 1,500. Early postal service from Cleveland was provided by Artemis Beebe, a rider who held the first contract to deliver mail across this section of the Black River.
By the turn of the 20th century, Elyria was a town of about 8,000. In 1908, Elyria Memorial Hospital was built. It has since evolved into an award-winning regional healthcare system. In the first half of the 20th century, the town developed some manufacturing, as well as a range of retail businesses.
In August 1967, at the peak of Elyria's population, Midway Mall was opened. It changed the local economy by attracting local businesses from the town center or causing so much competition they went out of business. Industrial restructuring meant that good jobs left the area, and poverty increased. Three major car plant closings in the area lead to economic stagnation and joblessness in the 1970s and 1980s that affected numerous communities. The region was nicknamed "the Rustbelt," suggesting the decline of its former industries.
In the 1990s, Elyria experienced a minor revival with construction of some new roads and housing. It serves as a residential, suburban "bedroom community" for Cleveland, located to the east, where new businesses and industries are developing with an increase in new jobs.
Hard times and new ideas have hit Elyria as the 2000s and 2010s rolled on, as industries such as Bendix, Riddell, and 3M are taking their business elsewhere, outside the city. To prepare for this hit, in March 2016, voters passed Issue 6, which was a 0.5% increase on the city's income tax, which was passed to pay for police expenses, as well as other things such as parks and Fiberoptic Internet throughout the city. With the Reconstruction of State Route 57 on the city's Northwest Side by Midway Mall, traffic flow has been greatly improved and there are minor revivals in the area such as new hotels and even hopes that a buyer will revitalize the area, with plans having even been presented. Revitalization efforts for Downtown Elyria continue through the efforts of groups such as Invest Elyria, Main Street Elyria, and in general the citizens. The historic Lorain County Courthouse is also being renovated to suit it for use once again, and a few buildings are even being reconstructed, and a few new ones also being constructed. There are plans for multiple small businesses and restaurants to go in to the downtown area over the next few years as of April 2017, and the city is showing signs of hope and revival, as its residents give the effort to restore the city to its peak days of the early to mid-1900s. In 2017, Elyria celebrated its 200th Birthday.
