St. George Forane Church, popularly known as Aruvithura palli, is a syro-malabar Catholic Church in Erattupetta. This Church is believed to be the oldest Church in eastern Kerala, and is considered to be the mother church of the ancient Syrian Christian community of both the Meenachil and the Kanjirapally Taluks. The church is believed to be founded in A.D 52  by Saint Thomas and later it was named martha mariyam church. It is commonly believed that in the 13th century, a group of Christians, who had to flee from Nilackal to save themselves from the hands of enemies, brought the statue of St. George from Nilackal and placed it in Aruvithura Church for veneration. From that time onwards, Aruvithura Church came to be known on behalf of St George.  There is also a popular belief that the St. George's Church was established by Saint Thomas the apostle himself. The annual festival of St George of Aruvithura is celebrated during April 15 – May 1 every year.
Aruvithura Church is one of the two oldest churches in Pala Diocese. Traditionally it is believed that the Catholic Church at Aruvithura was established in AD 151. It is assumed that a group of Christians who were baptised by St. Thomas lived here. All the major churches in Pala Diocese have their cultural and spiritual inheritance from Aruvithura Church. Pala, Bharananganam, Plassanal, Poonjar, Thidanad , Kanjirapally etc came under Aruvithura Church.
Going through history it is clear that the oldest churches were in the name of Martha Mariam. Aruvithura Church also was in the name of Martha Mariam until the 13th century. The statue of St Mary placed at the centre of the main altar is a clear proof of this fact. During the 13th century, a group of Christians , who had to elope from Nilackal to save themselves from the hands of enemies, brought the statue of St George from Nilackal and placed it in Aruvithura Church for veneration. From that time onwards Aruvithura Church came to be known on behalf of St George. People in and around Aruvithura were blessed with a lot of blessings from God as they sought the help from St George. Slowly St George at Aruvithura came to be known as "Aruvithura Valliachen".
The statue that was brought from Nilackal is still preserved in the Aruvithura Church. No repainting ormodifications were made on the statue until now. That is the statue is maintained as such painted in the 13th century. During the festival season the statue is brought forward from the altar and placed for public veneration. A rare custom that is followed in this church alone is that the statue is brought forward from the altar and replaced on the altar by Rev. Fathers alone.
The present church is the fourth church built in this location. Details about the first church is unavailable. The second church was built in the form of a temple. The third church was built in Portuguese model. The altar of the third Church is still preserved in the present church. The present church was built in 1951. It is 170 feet long and 50 feet broad. An aerial view of the church has the shape a Cross. The " Manimalika' in front of the church is 120 feet high. the statue of Christ at the top of the Church is 15 Feet high.
