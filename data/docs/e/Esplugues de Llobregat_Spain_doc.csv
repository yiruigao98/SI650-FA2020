Esplugues de Llobregat (Catalan pronunciation: [əsˈpluɣəz ðə ʎuβɾəˈɣat]) is a municipality of the Barcelona metropolitan area. It belongs to the comarca of Baix Llobregat, Barcelona province, Catalonia, Spain.
During the recent decades Esplugues has evolved from a predominantly industrial city to a modern city with all services, preserving however its cultural and historical identity.
It is known for its characteristic old quarter, the only one in the Baix Llobregat area with such evocative and romantic areas as el Carrer de Montserrat and the palace of Can Cortada, which was home to the Baron Maldà, author of Calaix de Sastre, the most representative work of Catalan literature of the late 18th century.
Esplugues holds a remarkable natural area with parks and green spaces such as the Park of Solidarity, the Park of Torrents and the Can Vidalet Park. From the mountain of Sant Pere Màrtir it is possible to enjoy a picturesque viewpoint of the entire town.
The German School of Barcelona and the American School of Barcelona are located in town and attract wealthy expatriate families who decide to get their kids educated there. Due to its proximity to the Camp Nou stadium, many famous footballers reside in Esplugues, such as Gerard Piqué and his wife Shakira, Andrés Iniesta, and Dani Alves, as well as the motorcycle racer Sete Gibernau, the former World Number 1 tennis player Arantxa Sánchez, and other personalities in the Spanish showbiz.
