El Campello (Valencian pronunciation: [el kamˈpeʎo]; Spanish: Campello) is a town on the Costa Blanca of Spain, within the  Valencian Community. It is a 20-minute tram ride from Alicante city. There is a busy marina and fish market.
The tower overlooking the harbour was built in the 16th century as a lookout for Berber pirates.  During the day, smoke signals warned other towers along the coast of the pirates' pending arrival, and fires were lit when it was dark.
During October each year, the town holds its moros i cristians (Moors and Christians) festival. The festival includes daily "battles" through the town, where arquebuses are extensively used. There are numerous parades and late night fireworks displays. The evening parades through the centre of the town are resplendent with extravagant costumes.
