Unterschleißheim was first mentioned in a document from 785, although the area has traces of settlements from 1400 BC.  During World War II, a women's subcamp of Dachau concentration camp was located here.  The town's 1200th anniversary in 1985 incorporated the inauguration of the new town center with the Town Hall and Citizens Advice Bureau.  On December 16, 2000, Unterschleißheim was granted privileges of a town, known as 'Stadtrecht' in German.

The lower part incorporates a green branch of a spruce and a green oak leaf on a golden background.Unterschleißheim is the home of a corporate office of Adobe Systems, as well as the headquarters of Microsoft's subsidiary in Germany and for Eastern Europe.

== Recreation ==
Lake Unterschleißheim was created from 1979–1980 by extracting fill to build the Autobahn.  Over the past 3 decades it has become an almost natural lake, with an ecologically balanced zone, a conservation area for seabirds during the nesting season, and a damp biotop covering 26 acres (110,000 m2) of land, of which roughly 18 acres (73,000 m2) is used for sunbathing.  With numerous shallow areas this is a popular summer gathering area for families with children,  and used frequently for ice skating and curling in the winter.


== Transport ==
Unterschleißheim is situated at the crossroads of two Autobahns, the A99 and A92, with direct routes to Stuttgart, Nuremberg and the  Munich Airport Franz Josef Strauß. Two S-Bahn stations on the Munich–Regensburg line, served by S1 trains, connect Unterschleißheim with the regional rail system.
