Aguata is a Local Government Area in Anambra state in Nigeria, with its headquarters in Aguata (location of the headquarters office buildings), a major part of which falls into the major commercial town of Ekwulobia, while the smallest part falls within Aguluezechukwu. There has been an age-long contention on this issue between the locals of Aguluezechukwu and Ekwulobia, with both towns claiming the status of the headquarters on account of ownership claim to the 'Aguata land'. This state of affairs caused the Government of Anambra State to officially declare that the headquarters of Aguata Local Government Area should be Aguata (the neuter name of the location in which the headquarters of Aguata Local Government Area Offices are sited) in a bid to settle the conflict.


== Ekwulobia ==
Ekwulobia, the largest town in Aguata, is expanding rapidly to a population of about 100,000 people. It is the major commercial town in the area. Most Nigerian commercial banks maintain their branches there. It also boasts a small sized stadium, a federal prison (part of which falls into Ezinifite), and a major market, Eke Market. Several new agricultural factories established around Ekwulobia town have also attracted workers. Ekwulobia is also a major transit hub from which travellers can connect to other far-flung cities in Nigeria. There is public transport that runs from Ekwulobia daily to Onitsha, Awka, Port Harcourt, Lagos, Abuja, Enugu, Abakaliki, etc.
In the area of hospitality business, the town has a few hotels, such as Orthon Palace Hotels, and in recent times, the Chicago Hotel, Vonic Hotel and resort, and Logart Hills Hotel. All these and many other features have made Ekwulobia attractive to visitors.
Ekwulobia People's Assembly is the mother union of all branches of Ekwulobia People's meetings, both at home and abroad, even among the diaspora, with the Lagos branch being the strongest of all the unions.
