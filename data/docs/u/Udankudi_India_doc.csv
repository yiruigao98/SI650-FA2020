While they were sailing away, they encountered a strong storm and realised their mistake of stealing the idol. They dropped the idol in the middle of the sea and seen the storm stopped immediately. Later, Lord Senthil Aandavan appeared in a dream to Vadamaliyappa Pillai, an ardent devotee of Lord Muruga, and revealed the place in the sea where the idol had been abandoned. Vadamlaiyappa Pillai a sponsor of services in the Thiruchendur temple, went to the spot in a fishing boat and retrieved the idol in 1653.Tirumalai Nayakkar was personally present along with Vadamalaiyappa pillai while the Idol of Lord Murugan was reinstated.
