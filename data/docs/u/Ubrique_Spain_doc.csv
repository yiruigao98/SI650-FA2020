== Geography ==
Ubrique is located between two Natural Parks: Grazalema and Los Alcornocales Los Alcornocales Natural Park.
Thanks to its location, it is surrounded by a rocky landscape with a great diversity of flora (olive trees, carob trees, cork oaks, holm oaks, etc.) and abundant fauna (vultures, birds of prey, mountain goats, etc.) mainly on the highest mountainous areas located in the valley of the Aljibe. The Ubrique River divides the town in half, although it also has another river: Tavizna River.
