Ungheni (Romanian pronunciation: [uŋˈɡenʲ]) is a municipality in Moldova. With a population of 35,157, it is the seventh largest town in Moldova and the seat of Ungheni District.
There is a bridge across the Prut and a border checkpoint to Romania. There is another border town with the same name in Romania (Ungheni, Iași), on the other side of the Prut River.


== History ==
The first historical mention of Ungheni dates to 20 August 1462. A railway between Ungheni and Chişinău was built in 1875 by Russia in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). After World War II, the rail route through Ungheni became the main connection between the USSR and Romania.

=== Gustave Eiffel bridge ===

In 1876 after the spring flooding of the river Prut, the railway bridge that linked Moldova and Romania was almost destroyed.
The Railways Department invited Gustave Eiffel to Bessarabia (Moldova) to redesign and rebuild the bridge.
Today, it remains a strategic structure under the supervision of border guards.
