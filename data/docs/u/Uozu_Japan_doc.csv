== History ==
The area of present-day Uotsu was part of ancient Etchū Province and has been inhabited since at least the Jōmon period. Discovery of gold in the mountains of Uozu around 1394 led to an influx of people, making the area around Matsukura Castle a center for the region. Later, when Matsukura Castle was destroyed, the center was reestablished around Uozu Castle close to the sea. In 1582, the Siege of Uozu occurred between forces allied to the Uesugi clan, and forces under Oda Nobunaga. Uozu Castle was captured by Oda forces only three days before Oda's assassination at the Honnō-ji incident.
Under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, Uozu was part of Kaga Domain ruled by the Maeda clan. The modern town of Uozu was established with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The Taisho rice riots of 1918 began at Uozu before spreading across the country. Most of the western portion of the town was destroyed in a fire in 1943, but the town escaped damage in World War II. Uozu was raised to city status on April 1, 1952. In September 1956, a great fire ravished many buildings in Uozu.

=== Uozu's Three Mysteries ===


==== Mirages ====
The waters of Toyama Bay are noted for mirages, especially during spring and winter. The spring mirage for which Uozu is famous for may be seen on warm, sunny, windless days from April to June. The Mirage Land Amusement Park (ミラージュランド) with its large Ferris wheel is a popular location for observation of the phenomena.


==== Firefly Squid ====
In the early morning hours, from the end of March to the beginning of June, female firefly squid (ホタルイカ, hotaruika) rise to the surface to spawn. Their name comes from a bluish white glow which emanates from various points on their bodies.


==== The Buried Forest ====
Approximately 2000 years ago, a primeval sugi (Cryptomeria) forest along the coast was partially buried so that only the trunks were preserved. The area is a National Natural Monument, and there is a museum in Uotsu where examples can be seen.
