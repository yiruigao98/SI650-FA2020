The municipality also borders the municipalities of Alegrete, Barra do Quaraí and Quaraí, and, also, Uruguay, making it one of the few international triple-border municipalities of Brazil.

At the time of its construction, the bridge was the greatest work of engineering of South America.Since 1987 there is a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back station for power exchange with Uruguay at Uruguaiana.
