Utrera (Spanish pronunciation: [uˈtɾeɾa]) is a municipality in south-west Spain. It is in the province of Seville, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. As of 2018 it has a population of 52,617.
The town is of great historical interest. It was occupied by Muslims in the 8th century and was not finally incorporated into the kingdom of Castile until 1340. Records about the town date back to the 13th century, when Alfonso X overran Utrera as part of his conquest of Seville, located 30 km to the northwest. However, archaeological work shows people have lived on the site since pre-Roman times. Today the town's five chapels, dating from the 14th to 18th centuries, churches and 14th century castle are popular tourist attractions for visitors to Andalusia.
Utrera is considered the cradle of the fighting bull and the flamenco, and there are many cattle farms in its municipal district.
The area is known for numerous festivities, particularly the fair, which is celebrated during the days before and after the day of Utrera's patron saint: the Virgin of Consolación. This fiesta attracts many people from all over Andalusia and Spain as a whole.
Utrera is also known for the mostachón, a kind of small flattened cake made with sugar and cinnamon.
