Uetersen (German pronunciation: [ˈyːtɐzən], formerly known as Ütersen (Holstein)) is a city in the district of Pinneberg, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is situated approximately 7 km (4.3 mi) south of Elmshorn, and 30 km (19 mi) northwest of Hamburg at the small Pinnau River, close to the Elbe river. Uetersen is home to the Rosarium Uetersen, the oldest and largest rose garden in Northern Germany, created in 1929.


== Name ==
The name of the city Uetersen, "utmost end", probably arose because it is "at the extreme end", referring to the fact that its location is at the transition to the geest Seestermüher marsh. But there is also the suspicion that the name of "Ütersteen" showing what "ultra-stone" or "Ütristina", the old name of Pinnau originates.
