Since the 1990s, the urban expansion of Johor Bahru has ended Ulu Tiram's relative isolation and it is now one of the fastest growing suburbs of the city as part of the Tebrau growth corridor. The town hosts a taxi depot which ferries people around Johor as well as to Johor Bahru. The taxi depot hosts a small shopping complex. The town is of little interest; markets and shophouses selling various provisions and accessories constitutes much of the town. The town also hosts a small housing and industrial estate.
