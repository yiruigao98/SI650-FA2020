Ukiah ( yoo-KY-ə; formerly Ukiah City) is the county seat and largest city of Mendocino County, California. With its accessible location (along the U.S. Route 101 corridor several miles south of CA 20), Ukiah serves as the city center for Mendocino County and much of neighboring Lake County.


== History ==


=== Establishment ===

Ukiah is located within Rancho Yokaya, one of several Spanish colonial land grants in what was then called "Alta California". The Yokaya grant, which covered the majority of the Ukiah valley, was named for the Pomo word meaning "deep valley."  The Pomo are the indigenous people who occupied the area at the time of Spanish colonization. This word was also the basis for the city name, as Ukiah was an anglicized form of Yokaya.The first Anglo settler in the Ukiah area was John Parker, a vaquero who worked for pioneer cattleman James Black. Black had driven his stock up the Russian River valley and took possession of a block of grazing land at that locale; a crude block house was constructed to house Parker in order to protect him and the herd from the hostile indigenous local population. This block house was located just south of present-day Ukiah on the banks of what was known as Wilson Creek.The next Anglo settler was a man named Samuel Lowry, who in 1856 constructed a log cabin approximately on the corner of today's East Perkins Street and North Main Street. Lowery sold his claim to A.T. Perkins in the spring of 1857, and the latter moved his family into the valley, thereby becoming the first pioneer family of the township. Six others followed to make their home in the community that same year. The first United States post office opened in 1858. By 1859 the population of Ukiah had grown to about 100 people, making it a community sufficient in size to serve as the county seat. Before this, administrative duties for Mendocino County had been handled by Sonoma County.The town was initially reachable only by stagecoach, with a short rail line from San Francisco terminating in Petaluma, nearly 80 miles to the south, necessitating a horse-drawn trip taking two full days as late as 1870. In subsequent years the rail line was extended further northward to Cloverdale, reducing the stagecoach trip to 30 miles — still enough to maintain the community's relative isolation and to fetter growth.Ukiah was finally incorporated in 1876. It was not until 1889 that the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad completed its line from Cloverdale to Ukiah, linking the Mendocino County seat to the national rail network at last.


=== Economic history ===
An agricultural and business community, over the decades various crops have been grown in the Ukiah Valley. They include pears, green beans, hops, apricots, and grapes. As part of the famous California Wine Country (California), grapes have become the predominant agricultural product.
Hops were once a predominant crop grown around Ukiah. The beer flavoring agent was first grown there in 1868 when L.F. Long of Largo grew an initial experimental crop. The climate proved suitable for the crop and production expanded, peaking in 1885, before faltering somewhat in the last years of the 1880s due to declining prices. Mendocino County remained the third-largest producer of hops in the state of California in 1890, with well over 900 acres under cultivation, and production continued well into the 20th century. A refurbished hop kiln can be seen at the north end of Ukiah east of Highway 101, where many of the old fields were located.
Ukiah's 20th-century population developed in relation to the lumber boom of the late 1940s, with the logging of redwood once being a major industry.
