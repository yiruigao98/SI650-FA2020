The city was founded on November 1, 1921.
Previously a coal mining town, the city has developed an effective policy to improve its environment.  In particular it has combated the problem of air pollution and its success in doing so saw it being recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme as among UNEP's Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1997.On November 1, 2004, the town of Kusunoki (from Asa District) was merged into Ube.


== Attractions ==

Ube publicizes itself as "a city of greenery, flowers, and sculptures".  Tokiwa Park is the centerpiece of this marketing, as it covers a large area near the center of the city and houses a large number of modern, mostly domestic sculptures on the shores of Lake Tokiwa.  The sculptures can be found around the city.  A sculpture competition is held biennially to provide new additions.
A well-known attraction of the park was a great white pelican called "Katta-kun", so named after his parents who were from Kolkata, India. Hatched in the park in 1985, he became famous as he began visiting schools in the vicinity. Katta-kun died in 2008, but there are a number of pelicans still residing in an enclosure there. In addition to the pelicans there were many mute swans and black swans residing there until 2011, when they were culled after an outbreak of H1N5 avian influenza. Two new mute swans were introduced in 2017.
There is a coal mining museum with a view over the city and airport.
