Since October 2010, this metropolitan area is the 75th biggest city of Mexico and the 5th biggest in Guanajuato. It is smallest of the 56 metropolitan areas in Mexico. 


== Toponymy ==
Uriangato is the Spanish version of a Purepecha word that means "the place where the sunset occurs on top" or anapu-nani-hima-huriata-hari-jatzhicuni-anandini in Purepecha.


== Human development ==

According to the United Nations/PNUD, in 2005 Uriangato was a municipality of High Human Development, with an index of 0.8147 (scale 0 to 1). This puts Uriangato at 432nd place in the country (2,454 municipalities of México) and 8th in all Guanajuato state (46 municipalities of Guanajuato), in terms of quality of life.
An average person in Uriangato earned $8,607 US dollars ($110,200 pesos) during one year (2005), which puts Uriangato in 365th place in the country and 12th place in Guanajuato state.
Uriangato, like all of Guanajuato state, is considered by CONAPO to be a High Migration Municipality, because more than 10% of its families receive money from their relatives in the United States. This situation has improved the quality of life in Uriangato, most of whose emigrants live in California, Texas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania and New York.


== History ==

Uriangato's land belonged to several native groups of Tarascos since the end of the 14th century. In 1597 Juan Ignacio Córcoles began to administer the Royal Certificate. Uriangato became part of Spain on February 20, 1604, by mandate of King Felipe III, who bestowed on it the official name of San Miguel de Uriangato. On November 19, 1845, the state congress of Guanajuato designated it as a Town, and in 1951 the local Congress granted it the title City of Uriangato.


=== Pre-Hispanic age ===
In pre-Hispanic times Uriangato was inhabited by native Purhépechas (Tarascos). At the beginning of the 15th century Uriangato and its environs were a territory between the Chichimecas and Purépechas whose opposing three kingdoms (señoríos) were located in what is today the State of Michoacán. The territory of Uriangato comprised the North border of the three Señoríos Tarascos; the "Great Chichimeca," named by the Spanish conquerors, began to the north of the Lerma River. The Spanish conquest of the New World left an indelible mark with the establishment of an indigenous population in the region.


=== Settlement ===
San Miguel Uriangato was founded in 1549 with the aim of improving natives' quality of life under the guidance of Fray Diego de Chávez.
On June 3, 1701 the Spanish Virrey (Viceroy) granted protection to the Mayor and the settlers of San Miguel Uriangato. In 1790 construction began on the Church's “two Towers,” where the Sanctuary of Lady of Guadalupe is located today. In 1804 Mayor Jose Dionisio Vallejo, as well as Juan Vallejo Bautista, asked the government for 600 varas (503 meters; at the virreinal time a vara was equivalent to 33 inches) for each cardinal point, the equivalent of the municipality of Yuriria today. Subsequently, new lands were annexed when the citizens of Yuriria observed the advantages of belonging to nearby San Miguel Uriangato. Land was similarly annexed by Moroleón's first inhabitants from Uriangato to form Moroleón's new municipality.


=== From Independence to Mexican Revolution (1810-1910) ===

In 1810 an insurgent army commanded by the priest Don Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla arrived at Uriangato, on the road to Valladolid—now known as Morelia—comprising the so-called Route of Independence—today route 2010.


=== Early 20th century ===
On December 10, 1908 the town of Uriangato officially became a Villa, by Decree Number 6 of XXIII, the Congress of the State. On November 9, 1951, the XLI Legislature of Guanajuato state's Congress declared Uriangato a City. By the end of 1908 the Kiosco of the Main Garden was constructed, and a year later street cars linked the Towns of Uriangato and Moroleón. Up until that time Uriangato's perimeter consisted of the following streets: 16 of September, Insurgente Olivares, Salvador Urrutia and Lerdo.
On June 24, 1918 the Heroic Defense of Uriangato was carried out against the notorious local bandit J. Inés Chávez García. García was typical of many Post-Revolutionary bandits who assaulted Mexican towns at that time. In 1919 a clock was added to the tower of San Miguel Arcángel church, whose construction was completed on November 10, 1923.


=== Textile industry beginnings ===
The production of rebozos (shawls) energized the textile industry by the middle of the 20th century in Uriangato and Moroleón. Little by little people took to producing handmade artesanal sweaters, blouses and shirts woven with a hook needle. The 1960s saw Uriangato's first clothing factories. Many textiles produced in Uriangato were sold in other Mexican cities. Nevertheless, due to the great demand for Uriangato-made clothing, the first street market (tianguis) was installed by the 1980s. The tianguis characterizes Uriangato all over México and elsewhere. It has contributed greatly to the progress and improvement of Uriangatenses' quality of life. Nearly sixty-percent of Uriangatenses work in the clothing business.


=== 21st century ===
In 2003 the Congress of the State issued Decree 204," which ordered that Moroleón return to Uriangato 160 hectares (400 acres) of land located from the present borderline to the community of "El Salto." This decree was vetoed on August 7, 2003 by the Governor of Guanajuato Juan Carlos Romero Hicks with the aim of avoiding social unrest.
In 2004 the construction of the Aldama vestibule and the remodeling of Uriangato's historical downtown were completed, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Uriangato's legal foundation. The festivities were accompanied by a light and sound show, as well as a folkloric ballet presentation directed by Amalia Hernandez.
On July 17, 2008 the first mall in the region opened: Metropolitan Galleries, including a supermarket (Soriana), a 7-part movie theater (Cinepolis), a fast-food court, bank, and several stores providing a variety of services and merchandise—as well as a large parking lot.

The border between Uriangato and Moroleón begins at 24 de Junio and Lindavista (Uriangato) behind the Sanctuary of Guadalupe (Moroleón). From there the border descends by Aquiles Serdán St. (Uriangato) from the Sanctuary of Guadalupe (Moroleón) to Jaime Nunó St. (Moroleón) or Miguel Martinez St. (Uriangato); both municipalities are separated by a single street with different names: Pípila (Uriangato) or Alvaro Obregón (Moroleón) in the central area that street are named 5 de Febrero (Uriangato) or Nezahualcóyotl (Moroleón).

The main current is  Huahuemba's river (it begins at Boulevard Juarez and flows on to the Presa de Huahuemba). The river issues forth from the confluence of two streams: Uriangato river which comes from Cuitzeo's lake and Moroleón river which comes from downtown Moroleón and crosses the Aurrerá's mall on 12 de Octubre St. Both rivers are united north of the Municipal Auditorium near Blvd. Juárez.
