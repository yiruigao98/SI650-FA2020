Uravakonda is a census town in Anantapur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is the headquarters of Uravakonda mandal in Anantapur revenue division. The town is a constituent of urban agglomeration.Uravakonda was formed about 115 years ago by the late Govindachar of Uravakonda. He was considered to be "one of the smartest men in South India at the time" and was an ace in mathematics. 
During British rule, Govindachar would be requested by British lords to help them drawing maps and measuring their lands accurately and would also count and manage the distribution of taxes. In return for the help Govindachar would get lands from the lords in different parts of Andhra Pradesh. 
Govindachar then took those lands and traded those lands for one big 1000 acre land called Uravakonda. He then brought villagers and developed the town by agriculture and building a clock tower. He also made good links with Anantpur and other neighbouring towns. 
At present, the government owns Uravakonda but the descendants of Govindachar are still alive. Sridhar and Adithya Uravakonda are the direct descendants of Govindachar.
