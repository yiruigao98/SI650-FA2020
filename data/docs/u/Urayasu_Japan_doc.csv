== Geography ==
Urayasu is located in the delta of the Edo River. The river runs along the western side of the city and separates it from the Edogawa ward of Tokyo. There are two parts to Urayasu:  the original fishing village on Tokyo Bay, and the newer reclaimed land portion that adjoins Tokyo Disneyland.  The new landfill area is called "Shin-Urayasu" (New-Urayasu), and has an "American" inspired layout, with a grid-like map of wide streets, large sidewalks, palm trees and parks.  The buildings are tall, modern apartments, some having views on Tokyo Bay. Urayasu is one of the most sought after areas in the metropolitan area for young families to live. However, plans are already under way to turn the local school facilities into retirement facilities in the future.


=== 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami ===
Urayasu was greatly affected by the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The reclaimed land across most of northern Chiba Prefecture was damaged by soil liquefaction in the earthquake. Urayasu, with major areas of reclaimed land, had as much as 85% of the utility infrastructure, roads, buildings, and houses damaged or affected to some degree by soil liquefaction. The damage cost the city approximately ¥73.4 billion to repair.

== History ==


=== Early history ===
The area around Urayasu was tenryo territory within Shimōsa Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period. Urayasu served as an important fishing village for the Edo capitol. Until the industrialization of the city it was a major center of production of nori, an edible seaweed, hamaguri, the common orient clam, and asari, the Japanese cockle. All three are important elements of the traditional Japanese diet.


=== Modern history ===
After the Meiji Restoration in 1868 the area became part of Chiba Prefecture. Urayasu Village was created on April 1, 1889 under Higashikatsushika District with the establishment of the municipalities system. Urayasu became a town in September 1909. Many of the residents of Urayasu perished during the 1944 Bombing of Tokyo.Urayasu grew in the 1960s and 1970s with massive landfill projects along the shores of Tokyo Bay, public housing projects, and increasing infrastructure. Urayasu became part of the Keiyō Industrial Zone in this period, which spans from the city across the Tokyo Bay coast of Chiba Prefecture to Futtsu to the south.  An area of the Tokyo Bay near the town was reclaimed form the sea in 1960s called Maihama. Fishing was abandoned in Urayasu in 1971 due to the industrialization of the city.Urayasu was elevated to city status on April 1, 1981. Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983 on 200 acres in Maihama.
