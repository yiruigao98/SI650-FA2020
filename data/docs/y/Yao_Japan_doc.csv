== History ==


=== Ancient Times ===
Yao was in Kawachi Province, and considered in Kawachi Bay. This area was a fertile delta along Old-Yamato River, and has been cultivated since Yayoi period(from 200 BCE to 300 CE). In the Kofun Period(from 250 to 538), many powerful families settled here and many Kofuns(mausoleums) were constructed on the foot of Ikoma mountain range, and many of them remain until now.
In Asuka period(from 538 to 710), this area was under the control of Mononobe clan, and people who made weapons for them lived in the area. The clan fell because Mononobe no Moriya was defeated by Soga no Umako. Yuge clan, which was a branch of Mononobe clan, however, kept control on the area. Dōkyō, who was from Yuge clan, became the most powerful person in the late Nara period(from 710 to 794).He constructed Saikyo(West Capital) called Yuge-gu in this area.
Takayasu castle, an ancient castle on Mount Takayasu, was constructed for defense against Tang dynasty, after Yamato was defeated at the Battle of Baekgang in Korean Peninsula. In 1978, a relic was discovered at the east side of Mount Takayasu, and researchers identified it as a warehouse of Takayasu castle, which was rebuilt after Jinshin War occurred at 673. They held another research at 1999, and discovered a stone wall for 100 meters made of Granite at the point 300 meters away from the top of the mountain. After the discovery, the archaeologists identified that the wall was over ten meters.


=== Middle & Early-Modern Times ===
In Nara period, this area prospered as an important point which connected Naniwa Capital and Yamato Province, and many highways were constructed.
In Heian period(from 794 to 1185), a capital moved to Heian-kyō, so this area and people who controlled here declined. Temples and nobles had their private estate here.
From Sengoku period to early Edo period, many wars occurred here. Some armed communities were made in Kyuhoji and Kayafuri areas. In summer campaign of Siege of Osaka, a severe battle was happened in this area. In early Edo period, Yao temple city was constructed.
Before the meddle term of Edo period, Yamato river flew from south to north and joined to the Yodo river. In this term, people had a large construction and Yamato river flew from east to west, and poured into Osaka bay directly. The construction decreased number of floods, and enabled this area to develop more paddy field. Besides, cotton cultivation flourished in this area, because the land, which was under the river, was made of sand, and it was suit with cotton.


=== Early-Modern Times ===
In Meiji period, Yao flourished with cotton cultivation, but it declined by the end of Taisho period. It was because cotton spinners wanted imported cotton, which was cheaper than that in Japan, and they required the government to abolish customs on that. After declining of the cotton cultivation, many farmers and factories started to produce brushes, and they became other important production of the city.
Two railways were constructed; Osaka Railway (now JR West Yamatoji Line) in 1889, and Osaka Electrical Railway (now Kintetsu Osaka Line) in 1924. This city developed as residential and industrial area, because it became easy to access from Osaka. After Pacific War, many roads were also constructed; National Route 25, Osaka Route 2, and National Route 170.
