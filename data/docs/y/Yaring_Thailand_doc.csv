In 2465 B.E. the Siamese Government established a Malayan provincial administration divided into seven districts and dependent on Pattani county. The county is divided into Pattani, Nong Chik, Yaring, Sai Buri, Yala, Ra-ngae and Kota Baru or Raman, which depend on Yala. Tuan Kalupae was the first sheriff of Kota Baru. His title was "Luang-aat-ta-sit-ti -som-boon".Kota Baru abounded with natural resources, including elephants, forests, gold and rubies. An army protected a territory extending to Perlis, Malaysia. Many governors were respected by Buddhists, Muslims and Chinese from both local and foreign areas, which are called Tohnijawea or Tohni.
Kota Baru Governor Phraya Ratanapakdee (Tuan malaleayawor) was wealthy and respected by the people. He donated land to build Ban Kota Baru school (Rattanapadung wittaya).

Kota Baru's palace was a shelter for people traveling or doing business in Yala. In the kitchen, two large cookers supplied rice for guests.
Kota Baru's governor enjoyed sport, especially a martial art called Si-la. The governor trained the young men in the palace as dancers and sent a teacher from Kota Baru to Kelantan state. On an important day, a si-la dance is held. At night time Di-ke hulu show is offered. Di-ke hulu was created in Kota Baru. Kota Baru was named "Kota Ramai" which means a city of joy relating to important events or welcoming guests from afar.
