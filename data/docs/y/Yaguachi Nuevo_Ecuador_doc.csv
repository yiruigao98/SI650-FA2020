This is a growing list of territorial Catholic dioceses and ordinariates in communion with the Holy See. There are approximately 3,000 actual (i.e., non-titular) dioceses in the Catholic Church (including the eparchies of the Eastern Catholic Churches).

For a structural overview, see List of Catholic dioceses (structured view)Those dioceses which are (metropolitan or nominal) archdioceses (including archeparchies) are marked in bold type and are also listed at List of Catholic archdioceses.
Those dioceses which belong to Eastern Catholic Churches (often called "eparchies") are italicized and their particular Churches and proper episcopal titulature are specified after the see name.
Missionary and other special types of circumscriptions (e.g., apostolic prefectures) are also specified before the country name.For the over 2000 titular dioceses, which no longer constitute actual jurisdictions, see List of Catholic titular sees.
