Yujing District (Chinese: 玉井區; pinyin: Yùjǐng Qū) is a rural district in eastern Tainan, Taiwan. It is famous for its cultivation of mangoes.After a 6.4-magnitude earthquake hit southern Taiwan in March 2010, pillars were severely damaged at Yujing Junior High School forcing school officials to cancel some classes.


== History ==
Yujing is likely the site of Tevorang, a former political unit of the Taiwanese aborigines. The name has also been spelled Tefurang, Tefurangh, Tevoran, Tevourang, and Devoran. Tevorang was one of nine villages that joined in warfare against the people of Favorlang (modern-day Huwei, Yunlin).
During the Kingdom of Tungning, members of the Siraya people from the Tavocan area (modern-day Xinhua) moved to this area due to conflicts with Han Chinese.
The Tapani Incident of 1915 was one of the largest armed uprisings by Taiwanese Han and aboriginals against Japanese rule in Taiwan.
In 1920, the name was changed from Tapani (Chinese: 噍吧哖; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Ta-pa-nî) to Tamai (Japanese: 玉井) and administratively was called Tamai Village, Shinka District (新化郡), Tainan Prefecture. During Japanese rule, Tamai produced abundant sugar.


=== Republic of China ===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Yujing was organized as a rural township of Tainan County. On 25 December 2010, Tainan County was merged with Tainan City and Yujing was upgraded to a district of the city. In the 1960s, with government promotion, the name "Yujing" became almost synonymous with "mangos".
