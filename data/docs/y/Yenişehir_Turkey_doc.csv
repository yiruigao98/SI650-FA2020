== History ==
Yenişehir, which was established by building permanent houses for the first time from the tent life in the Beylik period of the Ottoman Empire, was used by the Ottoman Army in Anatolia and Middle East expeditions due to its wetland and wide plain.  The city was founded by Osman Gazi,where for the first time, a sermon was read, coins were printed, taxes were collected, a regular army was started to be established, and the first law (edict) was commanded here. Then the city was the capital for a short time (29 years) (although Söğüt is also claimed to be the capital) and the city handed over the duty as capital with the acquisition of Bursa. The district is one of the developing districts of Bursa province.
The known history of Yenişehir dates back to the beginning of the 14th century. It was connected to the Ertuğrul sanjak, where Bilecik was the center at that time, and continued this position until 1926. İznik was the subdistrict of the city between 1926 and 1930.
After the capture of Köprühisar and Yarhisar in the years when the Ottoman Empire became a state, Osman Bey gave this region to his veterans as a sword right. Yenişehir became known with this name for the first time since it was opened for construction. In the book "Ottoman History", written by İsmail Hakkı Uzunçarşılı, the phrase "A Turkish city was established in the plain and a headquarters was built because it was close to the battlefield".
In the light of this information, it is understood that Yenişehir was established as a Turkish city and opened to residence. Yenişehir, a 680-year-old Turkish city, was occupied by the Greeks during the Turkish War of Independence/Greco-Turkish War between October 27, 1920 and September 6, 1922, and on September 6, 1922, the city was liberated from the occupation. The establishment of the villages goes back to old times, for example, the Yarhisar neighborhood is known to have Tekfur barracks during the Byzantine period. Likewise, Akbıyık and Süleymaniye villages have remained from the Byzantine period (castle). The Ottomans built many historical monuments in the city. 10 of the 17 mosques in the district center belong to the Ottoman period. Some of the mosques and baths built in villages were built during the Ottoman period. Other historical monuments in the district are Babasultan Lodge, Sinanpaşa Mosque and Caravansary, Çiftehamamlar, Süleymanpaşa Mosque and Mausoleum, Palace Bath, Shemaki House.
While describing the history of Yenişehir, it made it easier to tell that Osman Ghazi, the founder of the Ottoman Empire, spent his childhood in the Yarhisar neighborhood, and won great victories against the Byzantines in the Koyunhisar plain. The Ottomans also went to the west in several wars. In these wars, Osman Bey's brother Aydoğdu Bey was martyred. His grave is still in Koyunhisar neighborhood.
