Yeosu (Korean pronunciation: [jʌ.su]; Yeosu-si) is a city located on the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula in South Jeolla Province, South Korea and comprises the Old Yeosu City, founded in 1949, Yeocheon City, founded in 1986, and Yeocheon County which were merged into the current Yeosu city in 1998.


== Characteristics ==
The city of Yeosu consists of the Yeosu peninsula as well as 317 islands (49 inhabited, 268 uninhabited).  Being midway along the southern coast of South Korea, it is flanked by Namhae County in South Gyeongsang Province to the east with a natural waterway, and the Bay of Suncheon to the west and northwest, the city of Suncheon sprawling along its banks. The city has three different city halls.  On 1 April 1998, the cities of Yeosu and Yeocheon, along with Yeocheon County merged to form the unified city of Yeosu.

Yeosu is a city of history and loyalty where the headquarters of South Jeolla Province Navy Base was located, and the Great Admiral Yi Sun Shin improved upon the geobukseon (turtle ship) to save the country while serving as the commander of the navy.
Due to its appeal as an international ocean resort and tourist city, as well as its close proximity to the Yeocheon Industrial Complex, Yeosu has seen much development during the past several decades.
In the 142nd General Assembly of BIE, held in Paris on 26 November 2007, the global community selected Yeosu as the host city for the 2012 World Expo. This expo is Korea's second, following Daejeon's 1993 Fair.
