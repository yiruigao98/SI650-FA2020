The Universidad del Valle has a campus in Yumbo. Its address is located at Calle 2 Norte No. 1A - 105 Barrio Las Vegas.


== Industry ==
The city of Yumbo is known to be a rough area with a few factories, including concrete plants, which causes air pollution in that area. Bico International, a company that makes a complete line of school and office products, has a production plant in Yumbo, where it exports to various countries in Latin America. In August 2006, SABMiller plc, one of the world’s leading brewers, announced it would invest $175 million US dollars in a new brewery in Yumbo, in order to keep pace with growing demand in the western Colombia. The new brewery, which will become operational in late 2007, will have an initial capacity of 350 million litres, increasing to 450 million litres by 2009.  It will replace an existing 130 million litre facility in the central Cali, which is almost 80 years old and is on a site that can no longer be expanded. The new plant will be built on a high technological level and will provide employment for approximately 200 people. It will also include two new bottling lines, a keg plant and a new can line by the year 2009.
