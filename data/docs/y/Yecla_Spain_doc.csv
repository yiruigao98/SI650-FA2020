Yecla (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈɟʝe.kla]) is a town and municipality in eastern Spain, in the extreme north of the autonomous community of Murcia, located  96 km from the capital of the region, Murcia.


== Toponymy ==
The origin of the term Yecla comes from the Arabic Yakka, which was the name of a fortress located in the place that is now called Cerro del Castillo. This toponym, however, is not from Arabic origin and it is very likely that it derives from the pre-Roman terms Iko or Ika.
The most important mountains of the locality are Sierra de Salinas (1,238 m), Monte Arabí (1,065 m), Sierra de la Magdalena (1,038 m), and others. The chief buildings are a half-ruined citadel, a modern parish church with a pillared Corinthian facade, and a town hall standing in a fine arcaded plaza mayor (square). Yecla has traditionally had a thriving trade in grain,  wine, oil, fruit and other agricultural products produced in the surrounding country. Since the second half of the 20th century, furniture making has become a local trade.
