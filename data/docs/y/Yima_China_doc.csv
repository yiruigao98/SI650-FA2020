Yima (simplified Chinese: 义马; traditional Chinese: 義馬; pinyin: Yìmǎ) is a county-level city in Henan, China. It is under the administration of Sanmenxia. Yima is located in the western part of Henan province. It is located in the Xiaoshan Old Tracks, with Yangshao Peak to the north and Balcony Loewe to the south. Since ancient times, it was a key point between Luoyang and Changan. It has great strategic importance, being often a battlefield or a place for merchants to trade. Yima was founded two years before the Qin Dynasty established the new county system (it took 81 years to build the city). After the People's Republic of China was founded, Yima reached county-level status in Henan Province in 1981. It was originally under the administration of Luoyang. However, since 1986, it has been under the administration of Sanmenxia. Currently, it is one of the forty-eight counties in Henan Province trying to expand. It is also one of China's top hundred counties, as well as the smallest city in China (112 square kilometers with a population of about 160,000). Yima has the advantage of being self-sustaining, allowing for massive redevelopment of its industry and increased economic growth. In 2010, the city's per capita GDP was over seventy thousand RMB, which is about ten thousand US dollars. It ranks alongside moderately developed countries. In 2010, it was ranked first economically in Henan Province (perennial top five). The city is also known as "The Home of Martial Arts".

Hongqingsi GrottoesChu Pit SiteXiang Yu killed 200,000 Qin prisoners and threw their corpses into a hole. It is located twenty villages west of LiXingWan village. It is commonly known as a mass grave. In 206 BC, Xiang Yu massacred 200,000 prisoners right at this spot. In "History - Xiang Yu's notes", it says that "at night, the Chu army (led by Xiang Yu) killed 200,000 Qin soldiers in southern Xin'an (新安)", which is in present-day Yima. The site is in the shape of a pit, with an area of around 70-80 Mu (a Mu is an ancient unit for area, 1 Mu = 667 sq. m.). To the south, there was the river Jian; to the north, there was Tuling village. In the east and west, there was only flat plains. The hole's north was along LiXingWan Village. To the right, there was White Dragon Temple. In 1913, the Longhai Railway was built to run through the hole. Thus, the original shape no longer exists.
