Yelahanka is a suburb of Bangalore in the state of Karnataka and one of the zones of BBMP. It is older than the Bengaluru (Bangalore) city which has now overgrown engulfing many of its neighboring villages and towns.


== History of Yelahanka ==
The city of Yelahanka had been in existence prior to the 12th century. The region was called 'Ilaipakka Naadu' during the rule of Cholas. A stone tablet of 1267 A.D found in Doddaballapur mentions Dechi Devarasa, ruling the region with Yelahanka as his capital under the aegis of Hoysala monarch 'Narasimha (Third)'.
Later, during Hoysala rein, the city came to be known as 'Elavanka' and gradually shifted to 'Yelahanka'. It was also known as Elavank. Of the numerous Rulers of different dynasties who ruled with Yelahanka as their Capital, the Kempe Gowdas are the most acclaimed. Hiriya Kempe Gowda (Kempe Gowda the First) built a fort in the adjoining village of Bengaluru and developed it as his new capital, probably due to its strategic location and slightly cooler climate being at a higher altitude. It was his son, Immadi Kempe Gowda, who had the famous watchtowers built in the four directions of the new city.
Some Temples in Yelahanka—like the Venugopala Swamy Temple—have remained as a testimony to its rich past. Although a Fort's remnant could not be traced, a street nearby the Venugopala Swamy Temple is still known as 'Kote Beedi' or 'Fort Street'.

Yelahanka lies to the north of Bengaluru. It was a Municipal council and Taluk (lies below the District level in administrative setup) headquarters prior to the formation of BBMP (a metro corporation annexing the original Bangalore area and its suburbs) and now forms a part of Greater Bengaluru. A well-planned township was developed during the early 1980s to the north of the city by the Karnataka Housing Board and is identified by several names like 'Yelahanka Upanagara', 'Yelahanka Satellite Town', 'Yelahanka New Town' or simply 'Housing Board'.
