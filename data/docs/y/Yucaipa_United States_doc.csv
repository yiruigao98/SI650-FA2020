== History ==
Prior to the Spanish conquest of the Americas and the arrival of European settlers from Mexico, the land of the Yucaipa Valley was occupied by the Serrano Indians for possibly 1,000 years.


=== Yucaipa Rancheria ===
Yucaipa Valley supported a large population of Serrano Indians.  The fertile valley was watered by springs and creeks running out of the San Bernardino Mountains.  The Serrano lived in this location most of the year, but would make excursions into the mountains to gather acorns and other food items during their harvest season.  The Serrano name for the area was Yucaipat which meant "green valley."  The Rancheria is marked by California Historical Landmark #620.


=== Yucaipa Adobe ===

Near the Rancheria is the Yucaipa Adobe that is believed to be the oldest house in San Bernardino County. Diego Sepúlveda, nephew of Antonio María Lugo, built the Adobe in 1842 on land that was part of the Rancho San Bernardino granted in 1842 to the Lugos. It had formerly been land controlled by San Gabriel Mission.  The Rancho suffered losses of cattle and horses from raids by Native Americans coming through Cajon Pass and Banning Pass from the deserts.  Eventually, they sold the Rancho to Mormon settlers in September 1851.  The Adobe's later owners included John Brown, Sr., James W. Waters, and the Dunlap family; it was acquired by San Bernardino County in 1955.  The site is marked by California Historical Landmark #528.The nearby Oak Glen area is best known for its apple orchards, some of which are operated by the direct descendants of the original founders (the Parrish, Wilshire, Rivers, and Law families). The Parrish Pioneer Ranch and orchard were founded by Enoch Parrish in 1876, with the other families coming into the area later.


=== 2005 earthquake ===
At 1:53 p.m. on June 16, 2005, Yucaipa experienced a 4.9 Mw earthquake that was centered four miles (6 km) north of the center of town. It had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong) and was felt from downtown Los Angeles to some areas of San Diego. Three people were injured.


=== 2012 uptown revitalization ===
In a controversial effort to reinvigorate the struggling uptown Yucaipa area, the city took on multiple uptown boulevard improvements:
Uptown Yucaipa Boulevard Improvements, 2nd Street to Bryant Street (Phase 2B)
This phase of the project, funded by Redevelopment Agency (1998, 2004 and 2010/11) Tax Allocation Bond funds and Pavement Management Program funds completed street, drainage, hardscape, parallel on-street parking and reverse angle parking improvements on Yucaipa Boulevard between Bryant Street and 2nd Street. The project also included intersection improvements, replacing the existing traffic signals at the intersections of Yucaipa Boulevard at 2nd Street and California Street with roundabouts, associated hardscape and landscape features. Pedestrian improvements, including sidewalk, ADA curb ramps, crosswalks, street light foundations and associated signing and striping were also incorporated into the project.
Uptown Yucaipa Boulevard Improvements, 2nd Street to Bryant Street (Phase 2C & 2D)
This project, ultimately funded the same as Phase 2B above, provided decorative street light pole fixtures fitted with banners, speakers, video cameras (at limited locations), receptacles, and hanging baskets, lighted bollards, and the infrastructure, such as conduit, wiring and power source pedestals, required to support the project. Phase 2D provided landscaping in the planters including trees (with accent lighting), shrubs and wood chips along with the necessary irrigation, wiring, water meter and control systems necessary to support the landscaping and outdoor speakers for the sound system.
Uptown Decorative Metal Archway
This project was also funded by Redevelopment Agency (1998, 2004 and 2010/11) Tax Allocation Bond funds and Pavement Management Program funds and will install the Decorative Metal Archway immediately west of the 2nd Street Roundabout on Yucaipa Boulevard.
Uptown Decorative Metal Fence Fabrication and Installation
This phase of the Uptown Streetscape Project was also funded by Redevelopment Agency (1998, 2004 and 2010/11) Tax Allocation Bond funds and Pavement Management Program funds and installed a decorative metal fence in the roundabout areas at 2nd Street and California Street and Yucaipa Boulevard.


=== 2019 Uptown Revitalization ===
Performing Arts Center
In 2016, Yucaipa broke ground on a multi-purpose performing arts center on the corner of Acacia Avenue and California Street. Sitting on 2.7 acres in the heart of uptown, the 16,200 sq. ft. venue will host a variety of events including a community theater, open-air concerts, dance, and other arts-related events.

The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department serves Yucaipa—including the nearby unincorporated towns of Mentone, Oak Glen, Forest Falls, Angeleus Oaks, and Mountain Home Village—from its regional station at 34282 Yucaipa Boulevard(a much bigger replacement opened on July 1, 2014, next door to City Hall with a new address:34144 Yucaipa Boulevard). Since there is no official jail facility at this station, suspects are booked at either Central Jail in downtown San Bernardino or the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga.
Yucaipa has contracted operation of its fire department to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (now known as "Cal Fire") which serves the city from three stations: the 33000 block of Yucaipa Boulevard, Bryant Street (in the "North Bench" area), and the southwest corner of Fifth Street and Wildwood Canyon Road. Cal-Fire also provides paramedic level emergency medical service while patient transport by ground is handled by a private ambulance service.
