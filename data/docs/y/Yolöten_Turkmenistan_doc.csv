Some 10 billion cubic meters of gas will be exported to Iran per year from the Ýolöten gas field in the future due to a 2009 agreement between the governments of Iran and Turkmenistan involving people such as Gholam Hossein Nozari, the Iranian Minister of Oil and the Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister, Täçberdi Tagyýew.In the district around Ýolöten the growing of cotton and rearing of cattle is also of note.
