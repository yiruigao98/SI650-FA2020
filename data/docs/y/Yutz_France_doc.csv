Yutz (French pronunciation: ​[jys], German: Jeutz, Lorraine Franconian: Jäiz) is a commune in the Moselle department in Grand Est in north-eastern France, close to the borders with both Luxembourg and Germany. It was created in 1971 by merging the old communes of Basse-Yutz and Haute-Yutz. Macquenom is also a part of the commune since 1810.
The town is located by the river Moselle where it borders with the city of Thionville. The famous Basse Yutz Flagons, considered by many to be the apogee of Celtic art, were found in the area. They now form part of the British Museum's collection.The inhabitants are called Yussois.
