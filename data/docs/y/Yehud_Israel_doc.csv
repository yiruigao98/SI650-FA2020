Yehud (Hebrew: יְהוּד‎) is a city in the Central District in Israel that is part of the joint municipality of Yehud-Monosson. In 2007, Yehud's population was approximately 30,000 (including Neve Monosson – see below).


== History ==
Parts of Yehud are located on the land of the Palestinian village of al-'Abbasiyya, which became depopulated in the  1948 Arab–Israeli War.In June 2011, the city's officials announced they would undertake a massive construction project to replicate the old town square of the Swiss city of Lugano in the center of their city, to reinvigorate commerce and tourism. The replica will be replete with neoclassical columns and colonnades. This project was scheduled to be finished and in fall 2016. It opened in early 2018


== Local government ==

In 2003, the Yehud-Monosson Municipality was formed to provide municipal services to Yehud and the neighboring community of Neve Monosson (pop. 2,600). Under the terms of the merger, Neve Monosson remains with a high level of autonomy under the Neve Monosson Local Administration (minhelet). The Neve Monosson Local Administration was granted municipal status as an autonomous borough (vaad rova ironi) by the Interior Minister in 2005 within the implementation of the merger plan. In a practical sense, the Yehud-Monosson Municipality really functions as the municipality of Yehud whilst providing basic statutory municipal services to Neve Monosson on an outsourcing basis.
