== History ==

There was a settlement at Goygol since at least the 10th century. An extensive cemetery was excavated in the 1990s, with many bronze weapons (swords, daggers, axes), some jewelry (rings, bracelets, necklaces), and clay black dishes with the geometric designs, some of which are on display at the local museum.Under the Ganja Khanate a Tatar town on the site was known as Hanahlar. Subsequently, in 1795 it was conquered by the Qajar dynasty. It was abandoned during the Russian occupation of the area which began in 1804 and was formalised by the Treaty of Gulistan (Gyulistan Peace Treaty) in 1813.Helenendorf was founded on the site in 1819 by Germans from Württemberg, as ordered by Czar Alexander to help settle the region. The region was known as Narimanov under the czar. In 1930 the rayon (district) was established with Helenendorf as its administrative centre.
Expropriation of the colonists property and collectivization in Heleendorf began in 1926 with the show trial of three community leaders, Gottlob Hummel, Heinrich Vohrer and Fritz Reitenbach, on charges of counter-revolutionary and nationalist activities.  They were convicted, their property confiscated and they were sent to a labor camp in Kazakhstan.  By 1935, over 600 German families in the area had been convicted of "espionage" and sent to labor camps.In 1931 the town was renamed "Yelenino", and in 1938 the town was renamed "Khanlar", in honor of the Azerbaijani labor organizer Khanlar Safaraliyev, and the rayon also became "Khanlar".
In October 1941, the remaining German population was deported to Kazakhstan, Central Asia and Siberia on Joseph Stalin's orders. Anastas Mikoyan resettled displaced Armenians in the city following the Germans' departure.In 2008, Khanlar was renamed Goygol after the nearby lake, and the rayon became Goygol District.


=== Helenendorf ===
Helenendorf (German Helenendorf) is a German settlement founded in 1819 by settlers from Swabia in Transcaucasia (now the territory of Azerbaijan). Named in honor of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, the daughter of the Russian Emperor Paul I. In 1938, its name was changed to Khanlar, in 2008 - to Goygol.


==== Establishment of the colony ====
On May 10, 1817, the Russian Emperor Alexander I signed a petition of 700 Swabian families for resettlement in Transcaucasia. The city of Ulm was appointed the assembly point, from where the settlers were sent on ships down the Danube to Izmail. After the quarantine, they were resettled for wintering in already existing by that time Black Sea German colonies Peterstal, Josefstal, Karlstal and other Swabian villages. The settlers arrived in Transcaucasus only in August 1819, accompanied by Cossacks. Of the seven hundred families that left Ulm, only about four hundred have reached the goal; Some of the settlers died on the way from illnesses, others stayed in the Black Sea region. At the same time, about one hundred families from the Black Sea colonies joined the settlers. Six settlements in Georgia and two (Annenfeld and Elenendorf) in Azerbaijan were founded in the Transcaucasus.The colonists arrived to the appointed place in the winter of 1818, so they were forced to winter in Elizavetpole, and only in the spring of 1819, on Easter holidays, government officials determined the exact place of construction of Elenendorf - the former "Tatar settlement" Hanahlar, where "besides the half-buried canal and the pits in the ground, nothing reminded of the former inhabitants." The plots for the yards were distributed along two streets. The founders of the Helenendorf colony were  127 Swabian families (cа. 600 people), who came mainly from Reutlingen under the leadership of Gottlieb Koch, Duke Shiman, Jakov Krause and Johannes Wuhrer. Initially, the colonists had to live in dugouts, for several years they lived in very difficult and even dangerous conditions, so in the first winter (1818-1819) only 118 families survived. During the Russian-Persian War of 1826–28, the Swabians twice had to flee to Elizavetpol and Tiflis, fleeing from the advancing Persians, both times Helenendorf was burned by the Persians. In 1829–30, mortality due to diseases (including plague and cholera) was two times higher than the birth rate. Only in the 1930s did the colonists manage to gradually regain their lives.In 1843, the population of Helendorf was 609 people, in 1926 - 2157 people (but by this time the natives of Elenendorf founded two more colonies - Georgsfeld (936 inhabitants) and Traubenfeld (393 inhabitants)). They also moved to other subsidiary colonies, formed at the beginning of the XX century. In October 1941 (during the forced eviction of German colonists from Transcaucasia), the number of Germans living in Elenendorf and subject to eviction was 2,675 people.


==== Economic activities ====
By 1875, the colonists had fully paid the government credit (2000 rubles per family), which they received in 1818 for the relocation and arrangement of the farm. By this time, the main occupation of the colonists was the cultivation of grapes and the production of spirits - various varieties of vintage and table wine, cognac, champagne. The products produced in Elenendorf were sold by the local firms "Brothers Hummel", "Brothers Forehrer" and "Concordia" not only in Russia, in particular in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but also in Europe. Crafts were also developed. By 1908, the colony numbered 8 workshops for the production of horse carts (also supplied to the Russian army), 6 for barrels, 9 forges, 9 carpentry and 6 carpentry workshops, 4 sewing masters, 4 painters and 4 stoves, 3 locksmith workshops, one shoe master.


==== Social Development ====
The Schwabs who settled in the Russian Empire were Lutherans, but belonged to the Pietistic movement, which, in fact, was one of the reasons for their resettlement to the Caucasus. In 1832 a pastor arrived from Hannover to the colony, and before that, from the time of the founding of Elenendorf, divine services, the sacraments and rituals were conducted by a local teacher. In 1857 stone church of St. John. was built and consecrated in the village. In the thirties of XXth century, two newspapers were published in the German language  Bauer und Arbeiter and Lenins Weg.Due to the fact that there was also a teacher among the arrivals, the children of the colonists had the opportunity to study reading, writing and counting, later - geography and history. In 1823 the first school was built, in which children were trained in two classes. As the population grew, the school expanded, and the list of subjects studied in it expanded. From the 1890s, it became compulsory to study the Russian language. In 1907, at the Elendendorf school, a boarding school was opened to accommodate children from other Swabian settlements of the Transcaucasus who studied there. In the 20-ies of the XX century, teachers from Germany were invited to work at the school. So, for example, Alois Melichar (Alois Melichar), future conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic conducted music lessons in Elendendorf school.
The cultural life in Helenendorf began with the formation in 1893 of the German Society (Deutscher Verein), originally a male club with a library, a reading room and a bowling alley. Later on, the amateur wind and string orchestras and the theater studio were organized, which held concerts and performances both in the hall of the society, where up to 400 spectators could be accommodated, and at various festive events, including in the public garden of Helendorf. In 1930, a music school was opened with classes of pianofortes and stringed instruments. Various festivals, which gathered musical groups from all the Transcaucasian colonies were often held in Helenendorf (by the 1930s there were 21 colonies).
Traces of the German settlement can be seen in the school buildings and the parish church built in 1854.

The Assyrian population consisted of three families as of 2016.
