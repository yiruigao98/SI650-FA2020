== History ==
In 1886, a railway station was built on this site; at the time, the nearest settlement was the village of Zhuliany (Ukrainian Жуляни), so the railway station was given the name "Zhuliany" after the village. In 1912, people started settling around the station.
During the Russian Civil War (1917–1921) the Red and White armies fought here.
The population increased during the times of Joseph Stalin's forced collectivization policies (1928–1940), when peasants were settled near the station.
During World War II, Vyshneve became a battlefield. Soviet and German troops fought there until 8 August 1941. After the war, 365 inhabitants received awards for glory and heroism.
Between 1946–1956 the modern town of Vyshneve was built. A school was opened, a town council was formed and new streets were constructed. By 1960 the population had reached 4000.
In 1971 the settlement of Vyshneve was officially proclaimed by the Ukrainian Higher Council (parliament) as a town.
Vyshneve's population was 34,465 at the time of the 2001 Ukrainian census. The town has four schools, five kindergartens, a cinema, a clinic, two churches, a hospital and other elements of a modern town.
