Vitry-le-François (French pronunciation: ​[vitʁi lə frɑ̃swa]) is a commune in the Marne department in north-eastern France. It is located on the Marne River and is the western terminus of the Marne–Rhine Canal.


== History ==
In 1142, Louis VII invaded Champagne and seized Vitry-le-François. Over a thousand residents were killed when the town's church was set ablaze.
The present town is a relatively recent construction, having been built in 1545 at the behest of King Francis who wished to replace, on a new site, Vitry-en-Perthois, which in 1544 had been entirely destroyed as part of the backwash from the king's Italian War of 1542–46.   The new Vitry was to be a modern city, constructed according to a plan produced by Girolamo Marini.   The king's role in its creation resulted in Vitry-le-François receiving the king's name as part of its own name.

== Features ==
Its church of Notre-Dame is a 17th-century building with fine 18th-century monuments.
