The old wall, of which only parts remain today, was built to protect the inhabitants from attacks or from the plague. The remains of the wall, which succumbed to modernity in spite of its importance and simplicity, are visible in the old part of the city although the remains are situated near small modern buildings. In spite of everything three of the wall's original gates survive: Vila, Valado, with a Romanesque style, and Castelo da Ponte, also called the gate of Carlos V, that is the emblem of Viveiro. This door has the sculpted imperial arms of the monarch, the original arms of the kingdom, and the arms of the city.
Some of the mansions of the city's noble families still exist, such as the gunsmith's house sculpted in stone. Religious buildings include the monastery of the Concepcion, which was founded by María das Alas Pumariño (died 1601), and the chapel of Ecce Homo, also called the chapel of Pity, which Rodrigo Alonso Alfeirán (died 1608) paid for.
The city is home to several Romanesque historical buildings. These include the churches of San Pedro, Santa María, and San Francisco. The bridge over the river Landro dates back to the medieval era too.
