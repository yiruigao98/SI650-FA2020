== History ==
The region of the São Paulo plateau was inhabited by several indigenous groups, some from the coast, who sought refuge from the wars and slavery of the Iberian settlers. Others, such as Tupi-Guaranys and Jés (like the Kaigang and the southern Kayapó), had lived in the region since before colonization.
With the arrival of Europeans to the South American continent, the region was crossed by the "Bandeiras", who occupied lands considered unexplored and hunted Indians for slave labor, as well as looking for natural resources like noble woods, gold and precious stones, during century XVII. For this, the indigenous tribes were decimated or expelled from the region. African slaves were introduced to forcefully aid the Flags or to work on the newly created subsistence crops that were forming on the way to Goyaz.
At the end of the 19th century coffee farms settled in the northern region of Jundiaí county - many of them taking advantage of former farms that had been producing sugar and brandy since the 18th century. All the work was done by black slaves. White laborers, mainly European immigrants sponsored by the government and by farmers, occupied the slots left by the slaves after the abolition.
Intense commerce between the coffee-growing region and the capital of São Paulo moved troops of mules by the Old Road of Campinas. Departing from São Paulo towards the interior of Brazil, great cities were created every 50 kilometers, and between one and another, sometimes, a temporary stopping point.
Between Jundiaí and Campinas, a landing of tropeiros was created naturally in the middle of 1620 and, for usufruct of these, a small subsistence plantation, a "rocinha". One of the first properties installed in the place would later become the well known Waterfall Farm, which would eventually transform a senzala in Quilombo decades after slavery.
Just in the valley between Fazenda Cachoeira and Estrada Velha de Campinas, already popularly called Estrada da Boiada, Rocinha became, from 1840, a small village where black slaves benefited coffee, which soon would be sold to cities and later, the capital of São Paulo. With the abolition, the former black slaves were released and, without educational instruction or free labor offers, migrated to Minas Gerais and the capital of São Paulo. Few remained in the small town that already had in its population the presence of Portuguese, Spanish, German, French, Arab, some Americans and mainly Italian immigrants. Rocinha passed to the condition of Vila and District of Peace belonging to Jundiaí on October 31, 1908, by law promulgated by the then President of the State of São Paulo, Dr. Albuquerque Lins.
Already at this time, with the arrival of more Italian immigrants to supply the lack of manpower, the culture of the grape was introduced in the then town of Rocinha like main agricultural product, since the price of the coffee of the region suffered a sensible decrease with the expansion of the production in the cities of the center-west of the state of São Paulo and the construction of the Companhia Mogiana railroad, which made easy connection between the north of the state and the port of Santos, rendering obsolete coffee production of the small rock.
The grape then becomes the basis of the local economy. Throughout the district are spread the grape plantations for the production of wines, vinegars, sweets, and what more could be explored of the vines that fill the landscape of the place. Rocinha then stops being known only as a "stop" post and enters a frank economic and political rise.
A curious fact occurs in 1916: the owner of a farm on the Estrada da Boiada, about two kilometers from the railroad, hired a worker to enlarge a well for capturing or reserving water, approximately 25 meters deep.
During the work, an internal collapse partially buried the worker, who was trapped at the bottom of the building. For five days the ransom was tried, using all means available at the time. The fact took on a dimension, being widely reported at the time. The man did not survive, and history  helped in spreading the name of the village.
In the 1920s the first industries began to arrive in the district, as an alternative to the high installation costs in the municipalities of Jundiaí and Campinas. The district no longer had aspects of a simple village, and the emancipatory movements begin. In 1948, a plebiscite officializes the emancipation of Rocinha and its detachment of the administration of Jundiaí. On April 2, 1949, Rocinha became a municipality, with names such as Parreiral, Videiral, Vines, Vinhalândia and the chosen one, Vinhedo being suggested for the new city. Its inhabitants are called Vinhedenses.
From 1950 onwards, the Festivity of the Grape of Vinhedo begins, on the initiative of Favorino Carlos Marrone (who years later became a Monsignor), the parish priest of the Sant'Ana Parish, in the region that today comprises the center of the municipality,

=== Ecology and environment ===
Most of the original vegetation that it had in the city, the Atlantic Forest, was devastated. Like other 13 municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, the municipality suffers severe environmental stress. Vinhedo, together with Campinas and Artur Nogueira, is considered one of the areas most subject to floods and silting and accounts for less than 5% of vegetal cover.
To try to reverse this picture, several projects have been and are being carried out and planned, such as the construction of ecological corridors. There are also several environmental projects to combat the destruction of riparian forests located on the banks of the Cachoeira, Capivari and Pinheirinho rivers, which have a high pollution index of their waters. Presently, it is important to preserve the Jayme Ferragut Municipal Park in Vinhedo. The park has an area of 877 m², being one of the main parks of the RMC.
In the vinhedense original flora, there is a predominance of trees such as the pink jequitibá (Cariniana legalis), the pink peroba (Aspidosperma polyneuron) and the jatobá (Hymenaea courbaril), which reach 25 meters in height. There is an arboreal stratum of 15 to 18 meters high, composed of several species such as the white jequitibá (Cariniana estrellensis), the cedar-rose (Cedrela fissilis), the ivory (Balfourodendron riedellianum) and the fig trees (Ficus ennormis, Ficus glabra and Ficus guaranítica).
Fauna include the great-toed woodworm (Habia rubica), the rendeira (Manacus manacus) and the tangara (Chiroxiphia caudata); howler monkeys (Alouatta fusca) and prey monkeys (Cebus apella); the white ear possum (Didelphis albiventris), the black-ear possum (Didelphis marsupialis), the thick-tailed finch (Lutreolina crassicaudata) and the quartz (Gracilinanus microtarsus); (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), the cingling (Sciurus ingrami), the hedgehog (Coendou villosus), myocastor coypus, the capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris), prea (Cavea aperea) and teiú (Tupinambis merianae). There is also the wild dog (Cerdocyon thous), the mallard (Felis yagouaroundi), the hand-peeled (Procyon cancrivorous), the feron, the jararaca (Bothrops jararaca) and the poppy (Dipsas indica).
