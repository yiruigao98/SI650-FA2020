== History ==
Varamin is believed to be the ancient city of Varena, which is mentioned in Avesta.

The fourteenth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda, created, was the four-cornered Varena, for which was born Thraetaona, who smote Azi Dahaka.
The four-cornered citadel near the city is known as Citadel of Iraj by locals, Īraj was son of Thraetaona and that improves the city's relation to the ancient Varena.

Varamin has an extensive history. The raiding of Ray, by the invading Mongols and Timurids, generated a flux of migrations to this area.
Included amongst the significant antiquities of Varamin are the mausoleum of Imamzadeh Yahya built in the 14th century, and the Jameh Mosque of Varamin, from the era of the Ilkhanid Abu Saeed.
