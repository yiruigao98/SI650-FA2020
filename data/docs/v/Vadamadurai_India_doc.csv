Vadamadurai is a panchayat town in Madurai Region at Dindigul district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.


== Etymology ==
Vadamadurai is located in 17 Kilometre from Dindigul, on the way to Trichy NH-45. Vadamadurai is a developing town in Dindigul district. The queen named Rani mangammal from Vijayanagar empire was once in this place and built the temples around here. A well which was named for her is situated in the Trichy road of this panchayat town.
The name Vadamadurai is derived from the Tamil word vadakku meaning north. Vada - Madurai thus means north of Madurai; the reason why this village was named this is because the Temple City Madurai has a Kallazhagar festival in its (Vishnu Temple) 'Soundara Raja Perumal Temple', that is also celebrated in the temple of the same lord in Vadamadurai. The significance here is that only these two places in the whole of Tamil Nadu have such a temple with such a festival. The festival runs for 15 days, Aadi Therottam, Muthupallaku and Mattuthavani are important events in the festival. Nearly 18 village Panchayat people are participating every year. 'Mattu Thavani' (it means marketplace) selling bullock and cow during the festival time.  Now it is not celebrating because there is not sufficient space and the space was occupied by buildings.
