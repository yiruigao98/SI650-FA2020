== History ==

The history of Varennes starts with the arrival of the Régiment de Carignan-Salières in New France. René Gaultier, sieur de Varennes, was given three concessions by intendant Jean Talon in 1672, le Tremblay, la Gabelle and Varennes. Jaques-René, one of his sons, was the second seigneur of Varennes. Five seignories later composed the Varennes parish. They were the seignories du Cap de Varennes, de l'île Sainte Thérese, de Grand Maison, du Cap de la trinité and du Cap Saint-Michel. The town was captured by the British in 1760 during the Montreal Campaign. It was part of the Province of Quebec (1763–1791), then of Lower Canada, before it returned to being part of Quebec again in 1867 due to Canadian Confederation.
Varennes gained the status of city in 1972.
