Population: 59,704 (2010 Census); 45,310 (2002 Census); 31,946 (1989 Census).The town's name comes from manufacturer Vsevolozhsky. In 1941–1944, the vital road connecting besieged Leningrad with the rest of Soviet Union, the Road of Life, passed through the town.

== History ==
A number of villages historically existed within the current area of the town of Vsevolozhsk. In particular, the village of Ryabovo was first mentioned in 1727. From the end of the 18th century and into the 19th century, Ryabovo belonged to the family of princes of Vsevolozhsky, after whom the town was eventually named. In 1892, a narrow-gauge railway (Irinovskaya railway), the first such line in Russia, was constructed to transport peat for St. Petersburg's heating. A number of railway stations were opened, including Berngardovka, Vsevolozhskaya, and Melnichny Ruchey. Settlements eventually developed around the stations. The whole area was a part of Shlisselburgsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate. The settlement of Vsevolozhskoye, around Vsevolozhskaya railway station, was the first settlement in Russia where street gas lamps were installed. On February 14, 1923, Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd. In January 1924, the uyezd and the governorate were renamed Leningradsky.On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Leninsky District, with the administrative center in the settlement of Vsevolozhskoye, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On August 15, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. In May 1930, Vsevolozhskaya, Berngardovka, Ilyinsky, Maryino, and Ryabovo were all granted suburban settlement status. On August 19, 1930, Leninsky District was abolished and merged into newly established Leningradsky Prigorodny District with the administrative center in the city of Leningrad. On August 19, 1936, Leningradsky Prigorodny District was abolished and Vsevolozhsky District, with the administrative center in Vsevolozhskoye, was established. On November 27, 1938, the suburban settlements of Vsevolozhskaya, Berngardovka, Ilyinsky, Maryino, and Ryabovo were merged into the urban-type settlement of Vsevolozhsky, which became the administrative center of the district. On February 1, 1963, the urban-type settlement of Vsevolozhsky was renamed Vsevolozhsk and granted the status of town of oblast significance. In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure, and Vsevolozhsk became the town of district significance.
