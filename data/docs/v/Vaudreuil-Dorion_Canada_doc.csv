Vaudreuil-Dorion (French pronunciation: ​[vodʁœj dɔʁjɔ̃]) is a suburb of Greater Montreal, in the Montérégie region of southwestern Quebec. The result of the merger of two towns, Vaudreuil and Dorion, it is located in the Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality.  Ranked in 2017 as the 15th/100 best cities to raise children in Canada.


== History ==
On 23 November 1702, governor of New France Louis-Hector de Callière gave a seigneury to Philippe de Vaudreuil, who was governor of Montreal at the time. Rigaud de Vaudreuil later became governor of New France.
In 1725, the region had only 38 inhabitants. About 1742 people began to be interested in the region and Vaudreuil's population rose. 381 people lived in Vaudreuil in 1765. With the creation of the Grand Trunk Railway, people began to live in Dorion, which was called Vaudreuil Station. Dorion became a village in 1891.
Dorion was bisected by Autoroute 20 which links Downtown Montreal and Toronto via Highway 401 in Ontario. The Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway links between Toronto and Montreal are located in Dorion. Housing developments began in the 1950s and continued well into the 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, housing began sprouting north and east of Dorion.
Vaudreuil and Dorion merged in 1994, becoming the City of Vaudreuil-Dorion.


== Geography ==
Vaudreuil-Dorion is located on the south shores of the Lake of Two Mountains at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers, just off the western edge of Île Perrot. The city consists of two non-contiguous parts: its eastern part is the larger main area along Lake of Two Mountains where the population centres of Vaudreuil and Dorion are located; the western portion is a smaller rural area that borders Rigaud, and is separated from the eastern portion by Saint-Lazare and Hudson.
