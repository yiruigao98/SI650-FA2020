== History ==
Villarrica was founded as Santa María Magdalena de Villa Rica (Saint Mary Magdalene of Richville) in 1552 by Jerónimo de Alderete. The site of foundation was likely near that of present-day Pucón. During its early years Villarrica was an important gold and silver mining centre. However mining activity declined likely as consequence of burial of placer deposits beneath lahars of Villarrica Volcano. This burial would have prompted settlers to move the city westward to its modern site, a place less prone to volcanic hazards. Gold mined in Villarrica was known, together with gold from Osorno and other localities, as "gold from Valdivia" (Spanish: oro de Valdivia) as the mint where gold was sent was in that city.Abandoned after his death in 1554, it was refounded five years later by García Hurtado de Mendoza.  It grew into a small city, despite suffering destruction by a great earthquake on December 16, 1575. It had opened communications with Buenos Aires in its last years.
Following the Battle of Curalaba in the Arauco War, the last Spanish city to the south of the Bío Bío River was destroyed after a three-year-long siege, surrendering on February 7, 1603.  Before its destruction it had more than 600 Spanish inhabitants, not counting its Indian servants. At its surrender only 11 men and 13 women were taken captive.
The city was refounded on the site of the old city in the 1880s during the occupation of Araucanía. The population in 2002 was 45,531. Population growth and economic development has increased, due to a global reputation as a tourist destination for nature lovers, summer recreation and winter sports enthusiasts.After the city's refounding, the Chilean government established a land sale program to encourage settlement and invited European, esp. Swiss, German and Austrian immigrants in the last half of the 19th century to populate an area previously under control of the indigenous Mapuche.
