Villa Alemana ("German Town" in English) is a city and commune in Chile's Zona Central. It was founded in 1896 by Italian and German immigrants. Villa Alemana is a part of the urban area known as Greater Valparaiso.


== History ==

The city of Villa Alemana was founded due to the building of a railway, and was at the beginning of Chilean railway development.  Its climate is so temperate that the slogan is "The City of Eternal Youth" ("La ciudad de la eterna juventud" in Spanish) or "City of the Mills" ("Ciudad de los Molinos" in Spanish).
Villa Alemana, before being named, was nothing but fields. There was a small vineyard, many trees and flowers and what prevailed was the hawthorn. Around where Theater Pompeya stands today, land was offered for 20 cents per meter. And that was where Don Buenaventura Joglar had the idea to buy land and build a population which he named Villa Alemana, because the Germans were the first to buy these sites.
On November 8, 1894, it was founded under the name of Viña Miraflores. The property was owned by Don Buenaventura Joglar, who divided the land into lots and set the name of Villa Alemana.
On January 5, 1918, the commune of Villa Alemana was established, but in 1928 it was incorporated in Quilpué. On June 7, 1933, Villa Alemana separated from Quilpué, recreating the commune of Villa Alemana.
Today, Villa Alemana is a bedroom community of Viña del Mar and Valparaíso.
