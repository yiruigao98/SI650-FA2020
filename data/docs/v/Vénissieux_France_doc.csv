Vénissieux (French pronunciation: ​[venisjø]; Vènissiœx in the Lyonnais dialect of Arpitan language) is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in eastern France.


== Geography ==
Vénissieux is located on the southern outskirts of Lyon.


== Toponymy ==
The name Vénissieux derives from Latin Viniciacum, itself crafted upon a Roman villa landlord named Vinicius. Inhabitants are called 'Vénissians'.


== History ==
Vénissieux was part of Nazi-occupied France during World War II. In May 1944, the Allies bombed the Nazi-held factories in the area, with a focus on Berliet factories. On 2 September 1944, Vénissieux was liberated by the Allies.
Riots in September 1981, occurring particularly in the Vénissieux neighborhood of Les Minguettes, were some of the first of their kind in suburban neighborhoods in France. In the summer of 1983, riots again occurred in Les Minguettes, attracting significant media attention, and marked the first time cars were burned as a protest in France. France was experiencing a wave of racist crimes, particularly perpetrated against African immigrants from the Maghreb, particularly the former colony of French Algeria (independent Algeria since 1962). On March 21, 1983, a police raid led to violent confrontation between a group of young people of Les Minguettes and the police. Demanding the end to police intimidation, a hunger strike began. On June 21, 1983, during a police raid, a police officer shot and seriously injured Toumi Djaïdja, the young president of the association SOS Avenir Minguettes. In response, the idea of a nonviolent march emerged in order to attempt to reduce tensions between the police and the youth of Les Minguettes. Priest Christian Delorme and pastor Jean Costil organized an extended, non-violent march, inspired by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s demonstrations calling for the end of segregation in the United States and those of Mahatma Gandhi for Indian independence from the United Kingdom. They demanded equal rights, and an end to injustice and social inequality. The March for Equality and Against Racism grew into a series of events across France through the remainder of 1983.
Starting in the late 1980s, major urban renewal programs began transforming the Minguettes neighborhood, replacing old and crowded buildings and reducing high population density; between 1990 and 1999, the district's population declined by more than 2,000. Today Vénissieux is classified 'ZSP' for Priority Security Zone and still tarnished by a bad reputation because of its high crime rate. The district is home of about 22,000 inhabitants. Unemployment affects 40% of youth.
