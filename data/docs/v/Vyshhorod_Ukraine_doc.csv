== History ==

The earliest historical mention of Vyshgorod (the name literally translates as "the town upstream") dates from as early as 946, when it was described as the favourite residence of Saint Olga. Also mentioned in De Administrando Imperio, Vyshgorod served as the fortified castle and residence of the monarchs of Kievan Rus' on the Dnieper from that time until 1240, when the Mongols sacked it. At Vyshhorod Vladimir the Great (reigned 980 to 1015) kept a harem of 300 concubines.
After the Mongol invasion, the location does not appear in the records again until 1523 - and even then it was documented as a poor village. Vyshgorod grew considerably following the construction of the hydroelectric Kyiv power plant and was finally incorporated as a town in 1968.
In 1934-37 and 1947 the archaeological remnants of the medieval town were excavated. The most striking find was the basement of the eight-pillared Church of St. Basil, founded by Vladimir the Great and named after his patron saint.  As the church was one of the largest in Kievan Rus', it took twenty years to complete it. Before the Mongol invasion the church housed the relics of the first East Slavic saints, Boris and Gleb, but their subsequent fate remains a mystery. The ancient Cossack military monastery, the Mezhyhirskyi Monastery, stood not too far away from the city.


== Industry ==
There are more than 1500 enterprises and companies functioning today in Vyshhorod, most important of them being the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant, the Kyiv Pumped Storage Power Plant (both divisions of the Ukrhydroenergo) and a building materials factory controlled by the Henkel.


== Transportation ==
Vyshhorod is connected to the Kyiv and other destinations mainly by roads. There is also a non-electrified terminus rail connection to Kyiv used for both freight transport and peak hour commuter passenger service. City's riverport facilities are used for local industrial purposes only. Jitney buses run between Vyshhorod and the Heroiv Dnipra station of the Kyiv Metro's Obolonsko–Teremkivska line.
