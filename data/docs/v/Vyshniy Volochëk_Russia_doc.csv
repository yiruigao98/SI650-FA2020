Vyshny Volochyok (Russian: Вы́шний Волочёк, IPA: [ˈvɨʂnʲɪj vəlɐˈtɕɵk]) is a town in Tver Oblast, Russia. Population: 52,370 (2010 Census); 56,405 (2002 Census); 64,789 (1989 Census).


== Geography and etymology ==
The town is located 119 kilometers (74 mi) northwest of Tver, in the Valdai Hills, between the Tvertsa and Tsna Rivers, on the watershed between the basins of the Volga and the Baltic Sea. Hence the town's name is translated from Russian as "Upper Portage".


== History ==
The portage between the Tsna and the Tvertsa existed from the medieval times as confirmed by archaeological artifacts found in the area. Vyshny Volochyok as a settlement was mentioned in chronicles in 1471. In 1703-1722, Peter the Great had a canal constructed to link the two rivers (Vyshny Volochyok Waterway). In the 1740, the road connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg was built. These two events gave a start to the fast economic development of Vyshny Volochyok, which later also became a major center of textile manufacture and glass production. In 1772, the first fair was held, and in the first half of the 19th century the road was rebuilt in stone. In 1851, the railroad construction followed.In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Vyshny Volochyok was included into Ingermanlandia Governorate (since 1710 known as Saint Petersburg Governorate), and in 1727 Novgorod Governorate split off. On May 28, 1770 Vyshny Volochyok was granted town rights, and on April 2, 1772 Vyshnevolotsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate was established, with the seat in Vyshny Volochyok. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates, and Vyshny Volochyok was transferred to Tver Viceroyalty, which in 1796 was transformed into Tver Governorate.On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Vyshnevolotsky District, with the administrative center in Vyshny Volochyok, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Vyshny Volochyok was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. In 1990, Kalinin Oblast was renamed Tver Oblast.
