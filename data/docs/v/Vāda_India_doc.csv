== History ==
Goli Vada Pav was founded by Venkatesh Iyer. The chain started operations in early 2004 with a single ‘Quick service restaurant’. The first outlet was set up in Kalyan, a suburban locality in Mumbai. The company raised ₹21 crores from venture fund VenturEast in 2011.
A large-scale expansion of the outlets had to be abandoned due to the limited popularity of the franchise in Mumbai. At this point, Venkatesh Iyer received an offer from an acquaintance to set up an outlet in the city of Nashik in Maharashtra. Soon enough Goli Vada Pav was set up in over 40 cities with 150 outlet, and is now the 4th biggest fast food company in India. 
Goli Vada Pav stores operate under the name of 'Goli Vadapav No.1'
